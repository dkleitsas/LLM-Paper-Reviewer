ABSTRACT,0.004347826086956522,"For real-time forecasting in domains like public health and macroeconomics, data
collection is a non-trivial and demanding task. Often after being initially released,
it undergoes several revisions later (maybe due to human or technical constraints)
- as a result, it may take weeks until the data reaches a stable value. This so-
called ‘backfill’ phenomenon and its effect on model performance have been barely
addressed in the prior literature. In this paper, we introduce the multi-variate
backfill problem using COVID-19 as the motivating example. We construct a
detailed dataset composed of relevant signals over the past year of the pandemic.
We then systematically characterize several patterns in backfill dynamics and
leverage our observations for formulating a novel problem and neural framework,
Back2Future, that aims to refines a given model’s predictions in real-time. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that our method refines the performance of
diverse set of top models for COVID-19 forecasting and GDP growth forecasting.
Specifically, we show that Back2Future refined top COVID-19 models by 6.65%
to 11.24% and yield 18% improvement over non-trivial baselines. In addition,
we show that our model improves model evaluation too; hence policy-makers can
better understand the true accuracy of forecasting models in real-time."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.013043478260869565,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has challenged our response capabilities to large disruptive events,
affecting the health and economy of millions of people. A major tool in our response has been
forecasting epidemic trajectories which enabled policymakers to plan interventions (Holmdahl &
Buckee, 2020). Broadly two classes of approaches have been devised: traditional mechanistic
epidemiological models (Shaman & Karspeck, 2012; Zhang et al., 2017), and the fairly newer
statistical approaches (Brooks et al., 2018; Adhikari et al., 2019; Osthus et al., 2019b) including deep
learning models (Adhikari et al., 2019; Panagopoulos et al., 2021; Rodríguez et al., 2021a), which
have become among the top-performing ones for multiple forecasting tasks (Reich et al., 2019). These
models also use newer digital indicators like search queries (Ginsberg et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2015)
and social media (Culotta, 2010). Epidemic forecasting is still a challenging enterprise (Metcalf &
Lessler, 2017; Biggerstaff et al., 2018) because it is affected by weather, mobility, strains, and others."
INTRODUCTION,0.017391304347826087,"However, real-time forecasting also brings new challenges. As noted in multiple CDC real-time
forecasting initiatives for diseases like flu (Osthus et al., 2019a) and COVID-19 (Cramer et al., 2021),
as well as in macroeconomics (Clements & Galvão, 2019; Aguiar, 2015) the initially released public
health data is revised many times after and is known as the ’backfill’ phenomenon.The various factors
that affect backfill are multiple and complex, ranging from surveillance resources to human factors
like coordination between health institutes and government organizations within and across regions
(Chakraborty et al., 2018; Reich et al., 2019; Altieri et al., 2021; Stierholz, 2017)."
INTRODUCTION,0.021739130434782608,"While previous works have addressed anomalies (Liu et al., 2017), missing data (Yin et al., 2020),
and data delays (Žliobaite, 2010) in general time-series problems, the backfill problem has not been
addressed. In contrast, the topic of revisions has not received as much attention, with few exceptions.
For example in epidemic forecasting, a few papers have either (a) mentioned about the ‘backfill
problem’ and its effects on performance (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Rodríguez et al., 2021b; Altieri"

problem via simple models like linear regression (Chakraborty et al., 2014) or ’backcasting’ (Brooks
et al., 2018) the observed targets. The related problem of nowcasting involves prediction of revised
stable value of current week’s target from sequence of right-truncated past values [Aditya: cite one
paper ]. Prior works have used data assimilation and sensor fusion from a readily available stable
set of features to refine unrevised features for accurate nowcasting (Farrow, 2016; Osthus et al.,
2019a). However, most methods focus only on revisions in the target and typically study in the
context of influenza forecasting, which is substantially less noisy and more regular than the novel
COVID-19 pandemic or assume access to stable values for some features which is not the case for
COVID-19. In economics, Clements & Galvão (2019) surveys several domain-specific (Carriero et al.,
2015) or essentially linear techniques for data revision/correction behavior of several macroeconomic
indicators (Croushore, 2011)."
INTRODUCTION,0.034782608695652174,"Motivated from above, we study the challenging problem of multi-variate backfill for both features
and targets. We go further beyond prior work and also show how to leverage our insights towards a
general neural framework to improve model predictions and performance evaluation (i.e. rectification
of current target from the evaluator’s perspective). Our specific contributions are the following:"
INTRODUCTION,0.0391304347826087,"• Multi-variate backfill problem: We introduce the multi-variate backfill problem using real-time
epidemiological forecasting as the primary motivating example. In this challenging setting, which
generalizes (the limited) prior work, the forecast targets, as well as exogenous features, are subject to
retrospective revision. Using a carefully collected diverse dataset for COVID-19 forecasting for the
past year, we discover several patterns in backfill dynamics, show that there is a significant difference
in real-time and revised feature measurements, and highlight the negative effects of using unrevised
features for incidence forecasting in different models both for model performance and evaluation.
Building on our empirical observations, we formulate the problem BFRP, which aims to ‘correct’
given model predictions to achieve better performance on eventual fully revised data."
INTRODUCTION,0.043478260869565216,"• Spatial and Feature level backfill modeling to refine model predictions: Motivated by the
patterns in revision and observations from our empirical study, we propose a deep-learning model
Back2Future (B2F) to model backfill revision patterns and derive latent encodings for features.
B2F combines Graph Convolutional Networks that capture sparse, cross-feature, and cross-regional
backfill dynamics similarity and deep sequential models that capture temporal dynamics of each
features’ backfill dynamics across time. The latent representation of all features is used along with the
history of the model’s predictions to improve diverse classes of models trained on real-time targets,
to predict targets closer to revised ground truth values. Our technique can be used as a ‘wrapper’ to
improve model performance of any forecasting model (mechanistic/statistical)."
INTRODUCTION,0.04782608695652174,"• Refined top models’ predictions and improved model evaluation: We perform an extensive
empirical evaluation to show that incorporating backfill dynamics through B2F consistently improves
the performance of diverse classes of top-performing COVID-19 forecasting models (from the
CDC COVID-19 Forecast Hub, including the top-performing official ensemble) significantly. B2F
also enables forecast evaluators and policy-makers better evaluate the ‘eventual’ true accuracy of
participating models (against revised ground truth). This allows the model evaluators to quickly
estimate models that perform better w.r.t revised stable targets instead of potentially misleading
current targets. Our methodology can also be further adapted for nowcasting and other general
time-series forecasting problems. We also show the generalizability of our framework and model
B2F to other domains by significantly improving predictions of non-trivial baselines for US National
GDP forecasting (Marcellino, 2008).

NATURE OF BACKFILL DYNAMICS
In this section, we study important properties of the revision dynamics of our signals. We introduce
some concepts and definitions to aid in the understanding of our empirical observations and method."

INTRODUCTION,0.0782608695652174,"Thus, at prediction week t, the real-time forecasting problem is: Given D(t)
1:t, predict next k values of
forecasting target(s), i.e. ˆyt+1:t+k. Typically for CDC settings and this paper, our time unit is week,
k = 4 (up to 4 weeks ahead) and our target is COVID-19 mortality incidence (Deaths)."

. Note that previous work has
studied backfill limited to Y(t), while we address it in both X (t) and Y(t). Also, note that the data in
the backfill is the same used for real-time forecasting, but just seen from a different perspective."
INTRODUCTION,0.08695652173913043,"Backfill sequences: Another useful way we propose to look at backfill is by focusing on revisions of
a single value. Let’s focus on value of signal i at an observation week t′. For this observation week,
the value of the signal can be revised at any t > t′, which induces a sequence of revisions. We refer
to revision week r ≥0 as the relative amount of time that has passed since the observation week t′."

OBSERVATIONS
We first study different facets of the significance of backfill in CoVDS. Using our definitions, we
generate a backfill sequence for every combination of signal, observation week, and region (not all
signals are available for all regions). In total, we generate more than 30, 000 backfill sequences."

Obs. 1. (BERR across signals and regions) Compute the average BERR for each signal; the median
of all these averages is 32%, i.e. at least half of all signals are corrected by 32% of their initial value.
Similarly in at least half of the regions the signal corrections are 280% of their initial value.
We also found large variation of BERR. For features (Figure 1a), compare avg. BERR = 1743% of
five most corrected features with 1.6% of the five least corrected features. Also, in contrast to related
work that focuses on traditional surveillance data Yang et al. (2015), perhaps unexpectedly, we found
that digital indicators also have a significant BERR (average of 108%). For regions (see Figure 1b),
compare 1594% of the five most corrected regions with 38% of the five least corrected regions."

REVDIFFMAE: the difference between MAE com-
puted against real-time target value and one against the
stable target value. We analyze the top-performing real-
time forecasting models as per the comprehensive evalu-
ation of all models in COVID-19 Forecast Hub (Cramer

a well-trained real-time model will have higher REVDIFFMAE with larger BERR in its target (Reich

time values of signals are poor estimates of stable values. Therefore, we leverage patterns in BSEQ of
past signals and exploit cross-signal similarities (Obs. 3) to extract information from BSEQs. We also
consider that the relation of models’ forecasts to BERR of targets is complex (Obs. 4 and 5) to refine
their predictions. B2F combines these ideas through its four modules: • GRAPHGEN: Generates
a signal graph (where each node maps to a signal in Reg × Feat) whose edges are based on BSEQ
similarities. • BSEQENC: Leverages the signal graph as well as temporal dynamics of BSEQs to learn
a latent representation of BSEQs using a Recurrent Graph Neural Network. • MODELPREDENC:
Encodes the history of the model’s predictions, the real-time value of the target, and past revisions of
the target through a recurrent neural network. • REFINER: Combines encodings from BSEQENC and
MODELPREDENC to predict the correction to model’s real-time prediction."

a graph or use attention over temporal patterns of regions’ death trends. B2F, in contrast, directly
models the structural information of signal graph (containing features from each region) using
BSEQ similarities. Thus, we first generate useful latent representations for each signal based on
BSEQ revision information of that feature as well as features that have shown similar revision
patterns in the past. Due to the large number of signals that cover all regions, we cannot model
the relations between every pair using fully connected modules or attention similar to (Jin et al.,
2020). Therefore, we first construct a sparse graph between signals based on past BSEQ simi-
larities. Then we inject this similarity information using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
and combine it with deep sequential models to model temporal dynamics of BSEQ of each signal
while combining information from BSEQ s of signals in the neighborhood of the graph. Further,"

EARLY DECLINE,0.6347826086956522,"B2F adapts to anomalies During real-time forecasting, models need
to be also robust to rare events of large anomalous data revisions, like
during the initial stages of the pandemic when data collection was
not fully streamlined. Consider observation week 5 where there was
an abnormally large revision to deaths nationwide (Figure 8a) when
the BERR was 48%. B2F still provided significant improvements of
up to 74.2% for most model predictions (Figure 8b)."
EARLY DECLINE,0.6391304347826087,"B2F refines GDP forecasts To evaluate the extensibility of B2F to
other domains that encounter the problem of backfill, we tested on the task of forecasting US National
GDP using 25 macroeconomic indicators from past and their revision history for years 2000-2021. We
found that B2F improves predictions of candidate models by 6%-15% and significantly outperforms
baselines. The details of the dataset and results are found in Appendix Sections B, E.2."

CONCLUSION,0.6869565217391305,"We introduced the important and chal-
lenging multi-variate backfill problem
using COVID-19 and GDP forecast-
ing as examples. We compiled and
released the comprehensive CoVDS
dataset to study revision patterns in
features and targets as well as aid in
COVID-19 forecasting. We presented
Back2Future (B2F), the novel deep-learning method to model this phenomenon, which exploits our
observations of cross-signal similarities using Graph Recurrent Neural Networks to refine predictions
and rectify evaluations for a wide range of models. Our extensive experiments showed that leveraging
similarity among backfill patterns as well as model bias via our proposed method leads to significant
6 - 11% improvements in all the top models."
CONCLUSION,0.691304347826087,"As future work, our work can potentially help improve data collection and alleviate systematic
differences in reporting capabilities across regions. For example, B2F provides significant gains
consistently across time including when there are large anomalies in data. Therefore, our revision
modelling approach can be helpful for anomaly detection (Homayouni et al., 2021). We can also study
how backfill can affect uncertainty calibration in time-series analysis (Yoon et al., 2020). Adapting to
situations where data revisions can occur at different frequencies is another research direction."

ETHICS STATEMENT"
ETHICS STATEMENT,0.7043478260869566,"The features used in the CoVDS dataset and for GDP forecasting are publicly available and
anonymized without any sensitive information. Our backfill refinement framework and B2F is
generalizable to any domain that deals with real-time prediction tasks with feature revisions. Due to
the relevance of our dataset to public health and macroeconomics, prospects for misuse should not be
discounted. The disparities in data collection across features and regions can also have implications
on equity of prediction performance and is an interesting direction of research."
