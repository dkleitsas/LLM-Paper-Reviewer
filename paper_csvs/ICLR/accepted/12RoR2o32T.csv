ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0010362694300518134,"In many prediction problems, spurious correlations are induced by a changing re-
lationship between the label and a nuisance variable that is also correlated with the
covariates. For example, in classifying animals in natural images, the background,
which is a nuisance, can predict the type of animal. This nuisance-label relation-
ship does not always hold, and the performance of a model trained under one such
relationship may be poor on data with a different nuisance-label relationship. To
build predictive models that perform well regardless of the nuisance-label rela-
tionship, we develop Nuisance-Randomized Distillation (NURD). We introduce
the nuisance-randomized distribution, a distribution where the nuisance and the
label are independent. Under this distribution, we deﬁne the set of representa-
tions such that conditioning on any member, the nuisance and the label remain
independent. We prove that the representations in this set always perform better
than chance, while representations outside of this set may not. NURD ﬁnds a rep-
resentation from this set that is most informative of the label under the nuisance-
randomized distribution, and we prove that this representation achieves the highest
performance regardless of the nuisance-label relationship. We evaluate NURD on
several tasks including chest X-ray classiﬁcation where, using non-lung patches
as the nuisance, NURD produces models that predict pneumonia under strong
spurious correlations."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.0031088082901554403,"Spurious correlations are relationships between the label and the covariates that are prone to change
between training and test distributions (Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz, 2020). Predictive models that ex-
ploit spurious correlations can perform worse than even predicting without covariates on the test dis-
tribution (Arjovsky et al., 2019). Discovering spurious correlations requires more than the training
distribution because any single distribution has a ﬁxed label-covariate relationship. Often, spurious
correlations are discovered by noticing different relationships across multiple distributions between
the label and nuisance factors correlated with the covariates. We call these nuisance-induced spuri-
ous correlations.
For example, in classifying cows vs. penguins, typical images have cows appear on grasslands and
penguins appear near snow, their respective natural habitats (Arjovsky et al., 2019; Geirhos et al.,
2020), but these animals can be photographed outside their habitats. In classifying hair color from
celebrity faces on CelebA (Liu et al., 2015), gender is correlated with the hair color. This relation-
ship may not hold in different countries (Sagawa et al., 2020). In language, sentiment of a movie
review determines the types of words used in the review to convey attitudes and opinions. However,
directors’ names appear in the reviews and are correlated with positive sentiment in time periods
where directors make movies that are well-liked (Wang and Culotta, 2020a). In X-ray classiﬁcation,
conditions like pneumonia are spuriously correlated with non-physiological traits of X-ray images
due to the association between the label and hospital X-ray collection protocols (Zech et al., 2018).
Such factors are rarely recorded in datasets but produce subtle differences in X-ray images that
convolutional networks easily learn (Badgeley et al., 2019).
We formalize nuisance-induced spurious correlations in a nuisance-varying family of distributions
where any two distributions are different only due to the differences in the nuisance-label rela-
tionship. As the nuisance is informative of the label, predictive models exploit the nuisance-label
relationship to achieve the best performance on any single member of the family. However, predic-
tive models that perform best on one member can perform even worse than predicting without any
covariates on another member, which may be out-of-distribution (OOD). We develop NURD to use"

INTRODUCTION,0.0062176165803108805,"data collected under one nuisance-label relationship to build predictive models that perform well on
other members of the family regardless of the nuisance-label relationship in that member.
In section 2, we motivate and develop ideas that help guarantee performance on every member of
the family. The ﬁrst is the nuisance-randomized distribution: a distribution where the nuisance
is independent of the label. An example is the distribution where cows and penguins have equal
chances of appearing on backgrounds of grass or snow. The second is an uncorrelating represen-
tation: a representation of the covariates such that under the nuisance-randomized distribution, the
nuisance remains independent of the label after conditioning on the representation. The set of such
representations is the uncorrelating set. We show that the nuisance-randomized conditional of the
label given an uncorrelating representation has performance guarantees: such conditionals perform
as well or better than predicting without covariates on every member in the family while other con-
ditionals may not. Within the uncorrelating set, we characterize one that is optimal on every member
of the nuisance-varying family simultaneously. We then prove that the same optimal performance
can be realized by uncorrelating representations that are most informative of the label under the
nuisance-randomized distribution.
Following the insights in section 2, we develop Nuisance-Randomized Distillation (NURD) in sec-
tion 3. NURD ﬁnds an uncorrelating representation that is maximally informative of the label un-
der the nuisance-randomized distribution. NURD’s ﬁrst step, nuisance-randomization, breaks the
nuisance-label dependence to produce nuisance-randomized data. We provide two nuisance ran-
domization methods based on generative models and reweighting. The second step, distillation,
maximizes the information a representation has with the label on the nuisance-randomized data over
the uncorrelating set. We evaluate NURD on class-conditional Gaussians, labeling colored MNIST
images (Arjovsky et al., 2019), distinguishing waterbirds from landbirds, and classifying chest X-
rays. In the latter, using the non-lung patches as the nuisance, NURD produces models that predict
pneumonia under strong spurious correlations."

NUISANCE-RANDOMIZATION AND UNCORRELATING SETS"
NUISANCE-RANDOMIZATION AND UNCORRELATING SETS,0.008290155440414507,"We formalize nuisance-induced spurious correlations via a family of data generating processes. Let
y be the label, z be the nuisance, and x be the covariates (i.e. features). The family consists of
distributions where the only difference in the members of the family comes from the difference in
their nuisance-label relationships. Let D index a family of distributions F = {pD}D; a member pD
in the nuisance-varying family of distributions F takes the following form:
pD(y, z, x) = p(y)pD(z | y)p(x | z, y),
(1)
where pD(z | y) is positive and bounded for any y where p(y) > 0 and any z in the family’s
nuisance space SF. This family is called the nuisance-varying family. Due to changing nuisance-
label relationships in this family, the conditional distribution of the label y given the covariates x in
one member, e.g. the training distribution, can perform worse than predicting without covariates on
another member of the family, e.g. a test distribution with a different nuisance-label relationship. We
deﬁne performance of a model ˆp(y | x) on a distribution pte as the negative expected KL-divergence
from the true conditional pte(y | x): Perfpte(ˆp(y | x)) = −Epte(x)KL [pte(y | x) ∥ˆp(y | x)] .
Higher is better. This performance equals the expected log-likelihood up to a constant, Cpte =
Hpte(y | x), that only depends on the pte: Perfpte(ˆp(y | x)) = Epte(y,x) log ˆp(y | x) + Cpte.
Consider the following example family {qa}a∈R:
y ∼N(0, 1)
z ∼N(ay, 0.5)
x = [x1 ∼N(y −z, 1.5), x2 ∼N(y + z, 0.5)] .
(2)
Given training distribution ptr = q1 and test distribution pte = q−1, the conditional ptr(y | x)
performs even worse than predicting without covariates, Perfpte(p(y)) ≥Perfpte(ptr(y | x));
see appendix A.9 for the proof. The problem is that ptr(y | x) utilizes label-covariate relationships
that do not hold when the nuisance-label relationships change. When the changing nuisance-label
relationship makes the conditional pD(y | x) of one member unsuitable for another p′
D ∈F, the
family exhibits nuisance-induced spurious correlations.
Next, we identify a conditional distribution with performance guarantees across all members of
the family. We develop two concepts to guarantee performance on every member of the nuisance-
varying family: the nuisance-randomized distribution and uncorrelating representations.

tion is that when the nuisance is independent of the label, (noisy2) functions of only the nuisance are

In general, an environment is a distribution with a speciﬁc spuri-
ous correlation (Sagawa et al., 2019). When the training and test distributions are members of the
same nuisance-varying family, environments denote speciﬁc nuisance-label relationships. In con-
trast, nuisances are variables whose changing relationship with the label induces spurious correla-
tions. While obtaining data from diverse environments requires data collection from sufﬁciently dif-
ferent sources, one can specify nuisances from a single source of data via domain knowledge."

We brieﬂy men-
tion existing methods that aim to generalize to unseen test data and focus on how these methods can
suffer in the presence of nuisance-induced spurious correlations; for a more detailed presentation,
see appendix A.2. Domain generalization and domain-invariant learning methods assume the train-

is related to the given environments or subgroups (Li et al., 2018a; Arjovsky et al., 2019; Akuzawa

existence of a ﬁnite number of subgroups maps to an additional discreteness assumption on the
nuisance variable; in contrast, NURD works with general nuisances. Given a high dimensional z,
as in our experiments, deﬁning groups based on the value of the nuisance like in (Sagawa et al.,

Domain generalization methods
are inapplicable when the training data consists only of a single environment. In this work, the
training data comes from only one member of the nuisance-varying family, i.e. from a single envi-
ronment. What if one treats groups deﬁned by nuisance values as environments? Using the nuisance
as the environment label can produce non-overlapping supports (over the covariates) between en-
vironments. In Colored-MNIST for example, splitting based on color produces an environment of
green images and an environment of red images. When the covariates do not overlap between envi-
ronments, methods such as Arjovsky et al. (2019); Krueger et al. (2020) will not produce invariant
representations because the model can segment out the covariate space and learn separate func-
tions for each environment. Methods based on conditional distribution matching (Mahajan et al.,
2020; Guo et al., 2021) build representations that are conditionally independent of the environment
variable given the label. When the training data is split into groups based on the nuisance value,
representations built by these methods are independent of the nuisance given the label. However,
splitting on a high-dimensional nuisance like image patches tends to yield many groups with only a
single image. Matching distributions of representations for the same label across all environments
is not possible when some environments only have one label."

the other hand, the uncorrelating property allows using functions of only the nuisance that are in

LEARNING TO CLASSIFY WATERBIRDS AND LANDBIRDS
Sagawa et al. (2019) consider the task of detecting the type of bird (water or land) from images where
the background is a nuisance. Unlike Sagawa et al. (2019), we do not assume access to validation
and test sets with independence between the background and the label. So, we split their dataset
differently to create our own training and test datasets with substantially different nuisance-label
relationships. The training data has 90% waterbirds on backgrounds with water and 90% landbirds
on backgrounds with land. The test data has this relationship ﬂipped. We use the original image
size of 224 × 224 × 3. The training and test sets consist of 3510 and 400 samples respectively.
We ensure that p(y = 1) = 0.5 in training and test data. Thus, predicting the most frequent class
achieves an accuracy of 0.5. Cropping out the whole background requires manual segmentation.
Instead, we use the pixels outside the central patch of 196×196 pixels as a nuisance in NURD. This
is a high-dimensional nuisance which impacts many existing methods negatively; see section 4. The
covariates are the whole image; see ﬁg. 1."

LEARNING TO LABEL PNEUMONIA FROM X-RAYS
In many problems such as classifying cows versus penguins in natural images, the background,
which is a nuisance, predicts the label. Medical imaging datasets have a similar property, where fac-
tors like the device used to take the measurement are predictive of the label but also leave a signature
on the whole image. Here, we construct a dataset by mixing two chest x-ray datasets, CheXpert and
MIMIC, that have different factors that affect the whole image, with or without pneumonia. The
training data has 90% pneumonia images from MIMIC and 90% healthy images from CheXpert.
The test data has the ﬂipped relationship, with 90% of the pneumonia images from CheXpert and
90% of the healthy images from MIMIC. We resize the X-ray images to 32 × 32. Healthy cases are
downsampled to make sure that in the training and test sets, healthy and pneumonia cases are equally
probable. Thus, predicting the most frequent class achieves an accuracy of 0.5. The training and test
datasets consist of 12446 and 400 samples respectively. In chest X-rays, image segmentation cannot
remove all the nuisances because nuisances like scanners alter the entire image (Pooch et al., 2019;
Zech et al., 2018; Badgeley et al., 2019). However, non-lung patches, i.e. pixels outside the central
patches which contain the lungs, are a nuisance because they do not contain physiological signals
of pneumonia. We use the non-lung patches (4-pixel border) as a nuisance in NURD. This is a high-
dimensional nuisance which impacts existing methods negatively; see section 4. The covariates are
the whole image; see ﬁg. 2.
Results.
Figure 2 reports results. Building an oracle model in this experiment requires knowledge
of all factors that correlate the label with all the parts of the X-ray. Such factors also exist within
each hospital but are not recorded in MIMIC and CheXpert; for example, different departments in
the same hospital can have different scanners which correlate the non-lung patches of the X-ray"

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.15025906735751296,"We develop an algorithm for OOD generalization in the presence of spurious correlations induced
by a nuisance variable. We formalize nuisance-induced spurious correlations in a nuisance-varying
family, where changing nuisance-label relationships make predictive models built from samples
of one member unsuitable for other members. To identify conditional distributions that have per-
formance guarantees on all members of the nuisance-varying family, we introduce the nuisance-
randomized distribution and uncorrelating representations. We characterize one uncorrelating rep-
resentation that is simultaneously optimal for all members. Then, we show that uncorrelating repre-
sentations most informative of the label under the nuisance-randomized distribution also achieve the
same optimal performance. Following this result, we propose to estimate the nuisance-randomized
distribution and, under this distribution, construct the uncorrelating representation that is most in-
formative of the label. We develop an algorithm called NURD and show that it outperforms ERM
on synthetic and real data by adjusting for nuisance-induced spurious correlations. Our experiments
show that NURD can use easy-to-acquire nuisances (like the border of an image) to do this adjust-
ment; therefore, our work suggests that the need for expensive manual segmentation, even if it does
help exclude all the nuisances, could be mitigated."
DISCUSSION,0.15129533678756477,"Limitations and the future.
Given groups based on pairs of nuisance-label values, Sagawa et al.
(2020) suggest that subsampling equally from each group produces models more robust to spurious
correlations than reweighting (Byrd and Lipton, 2019; Sagawa et al., 2019); however, subsampling
is ineffective when the nuisance is high-dimensional. Instead, as sufﬁcient statistics of the condi-
tional ptr(y | z) render y, z independent, grouping based on values of sufﬁcient statistics could be
promising. The nuisance-randomization steps in generative-NURD and reweighting-NURD model
different distributions in the training distribution: ptr(x | y, z) and ptr(y | z) respectively. Methods
that combine the two approaches to produce better estimates of the nuisance-randomized distribution
would be interesting. The ﬁrst step in reweighting-NURD is to estimate ptr(y | z). As deep net-
works tend to produce inﬂated probabilities (Guo et al., 2017), one must take care to build calibrated
models for p(y | z). Adapting either calibration-focused losses (Kumar et al., 2018; Goldstein et al.,
2020) or ensembling (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2016) may produce calibrated probabilities. In our
experiments, the training data contains a single environment. Methods for invariant representation
learning (Arjovsky et al., 2019; Krueger et al., 2020; Mahajan et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021) typi-
cally require data from multiple different environments. Nuisance-randomized data has a different
nuisance-label relationship from the training data, meaning it is a different environment from the
training data. Following this insight, using nuisance-randomization to produce samples from differ-
ent environments using data from only a single environment would a fruitful direction. The absolute
performance for both ERM which exploits spurious correlations and NURD which does not, is too
low to be of use in the clinic. Absolute performance could be improved with larger models, more
data, using pretrained models, and multi-task learning over multiple lung conditions, all techniques
that could be incorporated into learning procedures in general, including NURD."

In learning ptr(y | z) for a high-
dimensional z, ﬂexible models like deep neural networks can have zero training loss when the model
memorizes the training data. For a discrete y, such a model would output ˆptr(y | z) = 1 for
every sample in the training data. Then, the model’s weight estimates on the training data are
p(y)/ˆptr(y | z) = p(y). Weighting the training data with such estimates fails to break the nuisance-

EXTENDED RELATED WORK"
REFERENCES,0.23523316062176167,"Domain generalization methods aim to build models with the goal of generalizing to unseen test
data different from the training data (Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz, 2020). Recent work uses multiple
sufﬁciently different environments to generalize to unseen test data that lies in the support of the given
environments or subgroups (Li et al., 2018a; Arjovsky et al., 2019; Akuzawa et al., 2019; Mahajan
et al., 2020; Krueger et al., 2020; Bellot and van der Schaar, 2020; Li et al., 2018b; Goel et al., 2020;
Wald et al., 2021). Chang et al. (2020) develop a multi-environment objective to interpret neural
network predictions that are robust to spurious correlations. Similarly, domain-invariant learning
and related methods build representations that are independent of the domain (Ganin et al., 2016;
Xie et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Ghimire et al., 2020; Adeli et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020).
Due to its focus on nuisances, NURD works with data from a single environment. As in section 4,
to split the data into multiple environments, one can split the data into groups based on the value of
the nuisance. Then, domain-invariant methods build representations that are independent of the nui-
sance and under nuisance-induced spurious correlations these representations may ignore semantic
features because they are correlated with the nuisance. Domain adaptation (Daum´e III, 2009; Ben-
David et al., 2007; Farahani et al., 2021) methods assume access to unlabelled test data which NURD"

correlations. Given these groups, group-DRO optimizes the worst error across distributions formed
by weighted combinations of the groups. With high dimensional z as in our experiments, deﬁning
groups based on the value of the nuisance typically results in groups with at most one sample;
with such groups, group-DRO will encourage memorizing the training data. Other work aims to
minimize worst subgroup error with a ﬁnite number of ﬁxed but unknown subgroups (Lahoti et al.,

of the worst subgroup error in general even with inﬁnite data.
In contrast, NURD builds predictive models with performance guarantees across all test distribu-
tions (that factorize as eq. (1)) using knowledge of the nuisance. Given the nuisance, existence of

dictive models requires a parameterization pθ(y | rγ(x)). When the family is known, for example
when y is categorical, the parameters θ are not needed because the distribution p(y | rγ(x)) can be
parameterized by the representation itself. For the critic model pφ(ℓ| y, z, rγ(x)) in the distillation
step, we use a two layer neural network with 16 hidden units and ReLU activations that takes as
input y, rγ(x), and a scalar representation sψ(z); the critic model’s parameters are φ, ψ. The repre-
sentation sψ(z) is different in the different experiments and we give these details below.
In generative-NURD, we select models for p(x | y, z) by using the generative objective’s value
on a heldout subset of the training data. For model selection, we use Gaussian likelihood in the
class-conditional Gaussian experiment, binary likelihood in the colored-MNIST experiment, and
squared-loss reconstruction error in the Waterbirds and chest X-ray experiments. In reweighting-
NURD, we use a cross-ﬁtting procedure where the training data is split into K folds, and K models
are trained: for each fold, we produce weights using a model trained and validated on the other
K −1 folds. Hyperparameter selection for the distillation step is done using the distillation loss
from eq. (6) evaluated on a heldout validation subset of the nuisance-randomized data from the ﬁrst
step.
In all experiments, we report results with the distillation step optimized with a ﬁxed λ = 1 and
with 1 or 2 epochs worth of critic model updates per every representation update. In setting the
hyperparameter λ, a practitioner should choose the largest λ such that optimization is still stable for
different seeds and the validation loss is bounded away from that of marginal prediction. Next, we
give details about each individual experiment."

train and sample. The encoder takes the lung patch as input, and the decoder takes the quantized
embeddings and the non-lung patch as input. VQ-VAE2 is hierarchical with a top latent code and
a bottom latent code which are both vector-quantized and fed into the decoder to reconstruct the
image. Both latents consist of 8 × 8 embeddings each of dimension 64. The VQ-VAE is trained
for 200 epochs with Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a batch size of 256 and dropout rate of
0.1. Generating samples from the VQ-VAE2 involves sampling the top latent code conditioned on
the label, followed by sampling the bottom latent code conditioned on the label and the top latent
code, and passing both latent codes to the decoder. To generate from the latent codes, we build a
PixelSNAIL to generate the top latent code given the label and a PixelCNN to generate the bottom
latent code given the label and the top latent code. These models have 5 residual layers with 128

consequently fail to generalize when the nuisance-label relationship changes. In fact, classiﬁers
produced by ERM on border-less images do not generalize well to the test data, producing test

that come from CheXpert and normal cases that come from MIMIC in the data; in this task, hospital
differences are one source of nuisance-induced spurious correlations. In both tasks, ρ = 0.1 in the
training data; as test ρ increases, the nuisance-label relationship changes and becomes more different

likelihood + information loss) on the validation subset of the training data. However, a small λ
may result in NURD learning non-uncorrelating representations which can also perform worse than
chance.
We ran NURD on the waterbirds and class-conditional Gaussians experiments with λ = 5 (instead
of λ = 1 like in section 5) and found that, on a few seeds, NURD produces models with close to
50% accuracy (which is the same as majority prediction) or large information loss or both. Excluding
