ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0024875621890547263,"The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples has drawn
tremendous attention from the community. Three approaches, optimizing stan-
dard objective functions, exploiting attention maps, and smoothing decision sur-
faces, are commonly used to craft adversarial examples. By tightly integrating
the three approaches, we propose a new and simple algorithm named Transferable
Attack based on Integrated Gradients (TAIG) in this paper, which can find highly
transferable adversarial examples for black-box attacks. Unlike previous meth-
ods using multiple computational terms or combining with other methods, TAIG
integrates the three approaches into one single term. Two versions of TAIG that
compute their integrated gradients on a straight-line path and a random piecewise
linear path are studied. Both versions offer strong transferability and can seam-
lessly work together with the previous methods. Experimental results demonstrate
that TAIG outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.1"

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.007462686567164179,"Adversarial example, which can mislead deep networks is one of the major obstacles for applying
deep learning on security-sensitive applications (Szegedy et al., 2014). Researchers found that some
adversarial examples co-exist in models with different architectures and parameters (Papernot et al.,
2016b; 2017). By exploiting this property, an adversary can derive adversarial examples through a
surrogate model and attack other models (Liu et al., 2017). Seeking these co-existing adversarial
examples would benefit many aspects, including evaluating network robustness, developing defense
schemes, and understanding deep learning (Goodfellow et al., 2015)."
INTRODUCTION,0.009950248756218905,"Adversarial examples are commonly studied under two threat models, white-box and black-box
attacks (Kurakin et al., 2018). In the white-box setting, adversaries have full knowledge of victim
models, including model structures, weights of the parameters, and loss functions used to train
the models. Accordingly, they can directly obtain the gradients of the victim models and seek
adversarial examples (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018; Carlini & Wagner, 2017). White-
box attacks are important for evaluating and developing robust models (Goodfellow et al., 2015). In
the black-box setting, adversaries have no knowledge of victim models. Two types of approaches,
query-based approach and transfer-based approach, are commonly studied for black-box attacks.
The query-based approach estimates the gradients of victim models through the outputs of query
images (Guo et al., 2019; Ilyas et al., 2018; 2019; Tu et al., 2019). Due to the huge number of
queries, it can be easily defended. The transfer-based approach, using surrogate models to estimate
the gradients, is a more practical way in black-box attacks. Some researchers have joined these two
approaches together to reduce the number of queries (Cheng et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2019; Huang &
Zhang, 2020). This paper focuses on the transfer-based approach because of its practicality and its
use in the combined methods."

INTRODUCTION,0.017412935323383085,"There are three approaches, standard objective optimization, attention modification, and smoothing
to craft adversarial examples. In general, combining methods based on different approaches together
yields stronger black-box attacks. Along this line, we propose a new and simple algorithm named
Transferable Attack based on Integrated Gradients (TAIG) to generate highly transferable adversar-
ial examples in this paper. The fundamental difference from the previous methods is that TAIG uses
one single term to carry out all the three approaches simultaneously. Two versions of TAIG, TAIG-S
and TAIG-R are studied. TAIG-S uses the original integrated gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017)
computed on a straight-line path, while TAIG-R calculates the integrated gradients on a random
piecewise linear path. TAIG can also be applied with other methods together to further increase its
transferability."

3 describes TAIG and discusses it from the three perspectives. Section 4 reports the experimental
results and comparisons. Section 5 gives some conclusive remarks."

RELATED WORKS"
RELATED WORKS,0.024875621890547265,"Optimization approach mainly uses the gradients of a surrogate model to optimize a standard
objective function, such as maximizing a training loss or minimizing the score or logit output of a
benign image. Examples are Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) (Madry et al., 2018), Fast Gradient
Sign Method (FGSM) (Goodfellow et al., 2015), Basic Iterative Method (BIM) (Kurakin et al.,
2016), Momentum Iterative FGSM (MIFGSM) (Dong et al., 2018) and Carlini-Wagner’s (C&W)
(Carlini & Wagner, 2017) attacks. They are commonly referred to as gradient-based attacks. These
methods were originally designed for white-box attacks, but are commonly used as a back-end
component in other methods for black-box attacks."
RELATED WORKS,0.02736318407960199,"Attention modification approach assumes that different deep networks classify the same image
based on similar features. Therefore, adversarial examples generated by modifying the features in
benign images are expected to be more transferable. Examples are Jacobian based Saliency Map At-
tack (JSMA) (Papernot et al., 2016a), Attack on Attention (AoA) (Chen et al., 2020) and Attention-
guided Transfer Attack (ATA) (Wu et al., 2020b), which use attention maps to identify potential
common features for attacks. JSMA uses the Jacobian matrix to compute its attention map, but its
objective function is unclear. AoA utilizes SGLRP (Iwana et al., 2019) to compute the attention
map, while ATA uses the gradients of an objective function with respect to neuron outputs to derive
an attention map. Both AoA and ATA seek adversarial example that maximizes the difference be-
tween its attention map and the attention map of the corresponding benign sample. In addition to the
attention terms, AoA and ATA also include the typical attack losses, e.g., logit output in their objec-
tive functions, and use a hyperparameter to balance the two terms. Adversarial Perturbations (TAP)
(Zhou et al., 2018), Activation attack (AA) (Inkawhich et al., 2019) and Intermediate Level Attack
(ILA) (Huang et al., 2019), which all directly maximize the distance between feature maps of benign
images and adversarial examples, also belong to this category. TAP and AA generate adversarial ex-
amples by employing multi-layer and single-layer feature maps respectively. ILA fine-tunes existing
adversarial examples by increasing the perturbation on a specific hidden layer for higher black-box
transferability."
RELATED WORKS,0.029850746268656716,"Smoothing approach aims at avoiding over-fitting the decision surface of surrogate model. The
methods based on the smoothing approach can be divided into two branches. One branch uses
smoothed gradients derived from multiple points of the decision surface. Examples are Diverse
Inputs Iterative method (DI) (Xie et al., 2019), Scale Invariance Attack (SI) (Lin et al., 2020),
Translation-invariant Attack (TI) (Dong et al., 2019), Smoothed Gradient Attack (SG) (Wu & Zhu,
2020), Admix Attack (Admix) (Wang et al., 2021) and Variance Tuning (VT) (Wang & He, 2021).
Most of these methods smooth the gradients by calculating the average gradients of augmented im-
ages. The other branch modifies the gradient calculations in order to estimate the gradients of a
smoother surface. Examples are Skip Gradient Method (SGM) (Wu et al., 2020a) and Linear back-
propagation Attack (LinBP) (Guo et al., 2020). SGM is specifically designed for models with skip
connections, such as ResNet. It forces backpropagating using skip connections more than the routes
with non-linear functions. LinBP takes a similar approach, which computes forward loss as normal
and skips some non-linear activations in backpropagating. By diminishing non-linear paths in a
surrogate model, gradients are computed from a smoother surface."

the quality of this approximation depends on equation 12, meaning that sign(IG(x)) and sign((∇f))

features are amended, and the transferability can be enhanced. To justify these arguments, Fig. 1

Large (Liu et al., 2018) are selected to evaluate the transferability of the adversarial examples. For
the sake of convenience, the names of the networks are shortened as ResNet, Inception, DenseNet,
MobileNet, SENet, and PNASNet in the rest of the paper. The networks selected for the black-box
attacks were invented after or almost at the same period of ResNet, and the architecture of PNASNet
was found by neural searching. The experiments are conducted on ImageNet (Russakovsky et al.,
2015) validation set. 5000 images are randomly selected from images that can be correctly classified
by all the networks. As with the previous works (Guo et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020), l∞is used to
measure the difference between benign image and the corresponding adversarial example. By fol-
lowing LinBP, the maximum allowable perturbations are set as ε = 0.03, 0.05, 0.1. We also report
the experimental results of ε = 4/255, 8/255, 16/255 in Table 6 in the appendix. The preprocessing
procedure of the input varies with models. We follow the requirement to preprocess the adversarial
examples before feeding them into the networks. For example, for SENet the adversarial examples
are preprocessed by three steps: (1) resized to 256 × 256 pixels, (2) center cropped to 224 × 224
pixels and (3) normalized using mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. At-
tack success rate is used as an evaluation metric to compare all the methods. Thirty sampling points
are used to estimate TAIG-S. For TAIG-R, the number of turning point E is set to 30 and τ is set"

COMPARISON WITH STATE-OF-THE-ARTS,0.2462686567164179,"Usually, one method has several versions by using different back-end attacks such as FGSM,
IFGSM, and MIFGSM. In the comparison, FGSM and IFGSM are selected as the back-end meth-
ods for one-step and multi-step attacks, respectively. In one-step attacks, the step size for all the
methods is set to ε. In multi-step attacks, for LinBP, we keep the default setting where the number
of iterations is 300 and the step size is 1/255 for all different ε. The linear backpropagation layer
starts at the first residual block in the third convolution layer, which provides the best performance
(Guo et al., 2020). TAIG-S and TAIG-R are run 20, 50, and 100 iterations with the same step size
as LinBP for ε = 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, respectively. For SI, the number of scale copies is set to 5, which
is the same as the default setting. The default numbers of iterations of SI and AOA are 10 and
10-20 for ε = 16/255 and ε = 0.1 respectively. We found that more iterations would improve
the performance of SI and AOA. Therefore, the numbers of iterations of SI and AOA for different
ε are kept the same as TAIG-S and TAIG-R. The authors of AOA method provide a public dataset
named DAmageNet, which consists of adversarial examples generated by combining SI and AOA
with ImageNet validation set as the source images. VGG19 was taken as the surrogate model and ε
is set to 0.1. For comparison, TAIG-R is used to generate another set of adversarial examples with
ε = 0.1 and VGG19 as the surrogate model. 5000 adversarial images generated by TAIG-R and
5000 images sampled from DAmageNet with the same source images are used in the evaluation. Ta-
ble 1 lists the experimental results of untargeted multi-step attacks. It demonstrates that the proposed
TAIG-S outperforms AOA and SI significantly but it is weaker than LinBP. The proposed TAIG-R
outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods in all models, except for SENet. In terms of average
attack success rate, TAIG-R achieves an average attack success rate of 52.82% under ε = 0.03.
Comparison results of the one-step attacks are given in Table 5 in the appendix, which also shows
the superiority of TAIG-R. We also provide the results of LinBP and SI under the same number of
gradient calculations as TAIG-S and TAIG-R in Table 8 in the appendix. VT (Wang & He, 2021)

attack success rate of 26% under ε = 0.1, which is the best among all the examined methods. The
second best is LinBP with an average attack success rate of 10.1%. Due to limited space, the full

EVALUATION ON ADVANCED DEFENSE MODELS,0.25870646766169153,"In addition to the undefended models, we further examine TAIG-S and TAIG-R on six advanced
defense methods. By following SI, we include the top-3 defense methods in the NIPS competition3
and three recently proposed defense methods in our evaluation. These methods are high level rep-
resentation guided denoiser (HGD, rank-1) (Liao et al., 2018), random resizing and padding (R&P,
rank-2) (Xie et al., 2018), the rank-3 submission4 (MMD), feature distillation (FD) (Liu et al., 2019),
purifying perturbations via image compression model (ComDefend) (Jia et al., 2019) and random
smoothing (RS) (Cohen et al., 2019)). ε is set to 16/255, which is the same as the setting in the SI
study (Lin et al., 2020), and ResNet is taken as the surrogate model in this evaluation. The results
are listed in Table 2. The average attack success rates of TAIG-R is 70.82%, 25.61% higher than the
second best – LinBP. It shows that TAIG-R outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods in attacking
the advanced defense models. We also evaluate the performance of TAIG-S and TAIG-R on two
advanced defense models based on adversarial image detection in Section A.5."

COMBINATION WITH OTHER METHODS"
COMBINATION WITH OTHER METHODS,0.263681592039801,"TAIG-S and TAIG-R can be used as back-end attacks, as IFGSM and M-IFGSM, by other methods
to achieve higher transferability. Specifically, IG(x) and RIG(x) in TAIG-S and TAIG-R can re-
place the standard gradients in the previous methods to produce stronger attacks. In this experiment,
LinBP, DI, and ILA with different back-end attacks are investigated. LinBP and ILA use the same
set of back-end attacks, including IFGSM, TAIG-S, and TAIG-R. For LinBP, the back-end attacks
are used to seek adversarial examples, while for ILA, the back-end attacks are used to generate di-
rectional guides. For DI, IG(x) and RIG(x) are used to replace the gradients in M-IFGSM and
produce two new attacks. The two new attacks are named DI+MTAIG-S and DI+MTAIG-R. The
numbers of iterations of all the back-end attacks are 20, 50, and 100 for ε = 0.03, 0.05, 0.1 respec-
tively. As ILA and their back-end attacks are performed in a sequence, the number of iterations for
ILA is fixed to 100, which is more effective than the default setting. And the intermediate output
layer is set to be the third residual block in the second convolution layer in ResNet50 as suggested
by (Guo et al., 2020). Table 4 lists the results. They indicate that TAIG-S and TAIG-R effectively
enhance the transferability of other methods. As with other experiments, TAIG-R performs the best.
The results of ε = 4/255, 8/555, 16/255, are given in Table 13 in the appendix."

CONCLUSION,0.34577114427860695,"In this paper, we propose a new attack algorithm named Transferable Attack based on Integrated
Gradients. It tightly integrates three common approaches in crafting adversarial examples to gener-
ate highly transferable adversarial examples. Two versions of the algorithm, one based on straight-
line integral, TAIG-S, and the other based on random piecewise linear path integral, TAIG-R, are
studied. Extensive experiments, including attacks on undefended and defended models, untargeted
and targeted attacks and combinations with the previous methods, are conducted. The experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In particular, TAIG-R outperforms
all the state-of-the-art methods in all the settings."

under ε = 4/255, 8/255, 16/255 running with 20, 50 and 100 iterations are given in Table 6. The re-

different ε with the same number of gradient calculations, and the results are listed in Table 8. For
AOA, the calculation of SGLPR is too slow, and we find that the average attack success rate of AOA
only changes from 32.07 (100 iterations) to 32.19 (300 iterations) under ε = 16/255. As the result
of AOA is not as good as LinBP and SI, we do not run it for more iterations. Table 8 shows that
more number of gradient calculations will slightly improve the performance of SI and LinBP, but
they are still not as good as TAIG-R."

COMPARISON WITH LINBP ON VGG19"
REFERENCES,0.6741293532338308,"Section 4.2 shows that LinBP performs the second-best among all the methods. Therefore, we com-
pare TAIG-R with LinBP using VGG19 as a surrogate model under ε = 16/255. LinBP is sensitive
to the choice of the position from where the network is modified. To find the best position to start
the model modification, we test all the possible position in VGG19 separately and generate adver-
sarial examples from these 16 different positions with 100 iterations. Then we use the six black-box
models to compare their performance. Table 9 gives the experimental results. We select SENet and
ResNet as two examples and show how the attack success rate of LinBP varies with the choice of
the position in VGG-19 in Fig. 4. Based on Table 9, we select the two modified positions with the"

and VT has two different versions NI-VT and MI-VT, which use MIFGSM and NIFGSM as their
back-end methods respectively. VT and Admix both use InceptionV3 as the surrogate model in their
study and they also provided 1000 images used in their evaluation. ε was set to 16/255 in their
experiment. Thus, we run TAIG-R on InceptionV3 on the same 1000 images they used under the
same value of ε. All the methods are run with 3000 gradient calculations. Table 11 lists the attack
success rate of these methods on different models and shows that TAIG-R outperforms MI-Admix,
MI-VT, and NI-VT in all the models. NI-VT is slightly better than MI-VT. As NI-VT performs the
best, we further run NI-VT on the 5000 images used in our evaluation with ResNet50 as a surrogate

the attack success rate is slightly improved when the number of turning points increases. But the
improvement becomes slow when the number of turning points is larger than 50. The results are
listed in Table 17. To study the influence of the number of sampling points S in each line segment,
we fix the turning points E to 20 and change S from 1 to 5. With the increase of sampling points,
the success attack success rate has slight improvements. The results are listed in Table 18."
