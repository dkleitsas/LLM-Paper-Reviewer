ABSTRACT,0.0020491803278688526,"Deep learning-based feature matching has shown great superiority for point cloud
registration in the absence of pose priors. Although coarse-to-fine matching ap-
proaches are prevalent, the coarse matching of existing methods is typically sparse
and loose without consideration of geometric consistency, which makes the sub-
sequent fine matching rely on ineffective optimal transport and hypothesis-and-
selection methods for consistency. Therefore, these methods are neither efficient
nor scalable for real-time applications such as odometry in robotics. To address
these issues, we design a consistency-aware spot-guided Transformer (CAST),
which incorporates a spot-guided cross-attention module to avoid interfering with
irrelevant areas, and a consistency-aware self-attention module to enhance match-
ing capabilities with geometrically consistent correspondences. Furthermore, a
lightweight fine matching module for both sparse keypoints and dense features can
estimate the transformation accurately. Extensive experiments on both outdoor
LiDAR point cloud datasets and indoor RGBD point cloud datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Our
code is available at https://github.com/RenlangHuang/CAST."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.006147540983606557,"Point cloud registration is a fundamental yet crucial task for a variety of 3D vision and robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) [1], object pose estimation [2]
and structure from motion (SfM) [3]. Aiming at aligning two partially overlapped point clouds,
the typical approach involves a two-stage pipeline: data association which establishes reliable
point correspondences, and pose estimation. However, establishing these correspondences has been
challenging due to the noisy, irregular, non-uniform, and textureless nature of 3D point clouds."
INTRODUCTION,0.00819672131147541,"Feature matching has long been the mainstream of data association without pose priors. Extensive
research has made advances in distinctive local feature representations, ranging from hand-crafted
descriptors [4, 5, 6] to recent learning-based descriptors [7, 8, 9]. Although the emerging learning-
based descriptors significantly improve the reliability of correspondences, the inlier ratio still falls
short of what is required for robust and efficient pose estimation. Recently, coarse-to-fine matching is
a thriving framework for 2D-2D [10], 3D-3D [11, 12, 13], and even 2D-3D [14] data association. It
has been a consensus that Transformers stacked by alternate self-attention and cross-attention modules
are effective for coarse matching, which are inspired by human visual processes. Typically, humans
may first scan through the point clouds to identify and match salient landmarks across different point
clouds reliably. For less salient points, the geometric relationships between them and those salient
landmarks would be utilized to revisit their potential correspondences. The correspondences will
eventually be established for the entire point cloud after several iterations of this process."

INTRODUCTION,0.012295081967213115,"Unfortunately, existing coarse matching approaches tend to be sparse and loose without consideration
of geometric consistency. An important reason for looseness is that global cross-attention inevitably
attends to similar yet irrelevant areas, resulting in misleading feature aggregation and consequent
inconsistent correspondences that undermine both robustness and accuracy. As a result, the hypothesis-
and-selection pipeline such as RANSAC [15] is commonly used for outlier rejection, which is typically
inaccurate and inefficient, especially for numerous samples with low inlier ratio. Furthermore, the
sparsity necessitates the use of complicated fine matching such as optimal transport-based algorithms
to establish reliable dense correspondences. Due to iterative dense matrix operations for patch-to-
patch correspondences established by coarse matching, these fine matching methods are neither
efficient nor scalable for real-time large-scale applications such as odometry."
INTRODUCTION,0.014344262295081968,"To this end, we attempt to design an efficient and scalable coarse-to-fine matching network based
on consistency-aware semi-dense coarse correspondences. Inspired by ASTR [10] for 2D feature
matching, we leverage local consistency to direct the cross-attention of each point exclusively
to corresponding patches of its confident neighbors, which is referred to as spot-guided cross-
attention. Unlike [10], we propose a novel consistency-aware matching confidence criterion to sample
reliable neighbors based on both feature similarity and geometric compatibility. Additionally, we
design a consistency-aware self-attention module to enhance the distinctiveness of coarse feature
representations via aggregation with salient nodes from the compatibility graph. Notably, both spot-
guided cross-attention and consistency-aware self-attention are efficient sparse attention mechanisms."
INTRODUCTION,0.01639344262295082,"For scalability to real-time applications such as odometry with pose priors, we propose a lightweight
fine matching module allowing independent deployment without coarse matching. The scalability
is credited to flexible point-to-patch local matching instead of optimal transport heavily relying on
patch-to-patch correspondences. In addition, our fine matching adopts a sparse-to-dense registration
pipeline, benefiting from the efficiency of sparse keypoint matching and the accuracy of dense
registration. Furthermore, an efficient compatibility graph embedding module is leveraged for outlier
rejection as a substitute for inefficient hypothesis-and-selection pipelines."

RELATED WORK,0.030737704918032786,"3D Feature Descriptors.
Feature matching plays a crucial role in point cloud registration, enabling
the establishment of reliable correspondences without pose priors. Early methods use hand-crafted
descriptors based on signatures [6] or histograms [4, 5] to represent local geometric features. Recently,
learning-based 3D descriptors have showcased greater performance than hand-crafted ones, which
are usually trained in a self-supervised manner by maximizing the similarity between descriptors of
true correspondences and minimizing the similarity otherwise. 3DMatch [16] and PerfectMatch [7]
leverage 3D CNNs to learn local patch-wise descriptors from 3D patches converted into voxels
of truncated distance function (TDF) values and smoothed density value (SDV) representations,
respectively. PPFNet [17] extracts global context-aware patch-wise descriptors based on PointNet [18].
FCGF [8] employs a sparse 3D convolutional encoder-decoder network for dense descriptor learning.
SpinNet [19] proposes a 3D cylindrical convolution network to extract rotation-invariant patch-wise
descriptors. Predator [20] utilizes graph convolution and cross-attention to enhance the descriptors
and predict the overlapping regions for robust performance in low overlap scenarios."

Intuitively, the correspondences of less salient nodes can
be effectively located based on the geometric relationships between them and the salient ones.
Hence, compared with global self-attention that attends to all nodes, attending to only salient nodes
is more efficient and effective to encode the geometric context for matching. We propose the
consistency-aware self-attention that samples sparse salient nodes to be attended to based on both
geometric consistency and feature similarity. Given the correspondence set C(l) with a compatibility
graph, we perform two-stage sampling by ranking the generalized degrees and matching scores,
respectively. The first-stage graph sampling using generalized degrees can obtain sufficient consistent
correspondences as proposals. The second-stage sampling based on matching scores can further

ABLATION STUDIES,0.36065573770491804,"We select indoor datasets for ablation studies of coarse matching as they are more challenging. Here
we evaluate the RR over the whole dataset rather than the average RR of eight sequences reported
in Table 3, which is more reasonable for a dataset with significant variances of sequence lengths.
Besides, we assess two extra metrics to directly measure the performance of coarse matching: patch
inlier ratio (PIR), the fraction of patch matches with actual overlap; and patch matching recall (PMR),
the fraction of point cloud pairs with PIR above 20%. Results from five experiments in Table 4
demonstrate the effects of the proposed multi-scale feature fusion (MS), spot-guided cross-attention
(SG), consistency-aware self-attention (CA), and the overlap head for overlap score prediction (OV).
The first experiment ablating CA and replacing SG with linear cross-attention, suffers performance
degradation in all metrics due to inconsistency. The second experiment improves all metrics based on
SG, while the last one achieves the best performance via CA, showcasing their effectiveness. Figure 2
visualizes the vanilla global cross-attention and our spot-guided cross-attention. Instead of interacting
with many similar yet irrelevant regions for misleading feature aggregation, SG can effectively select
instructive areas to attend to according to local consistency. Compared to the last experiment, the
third one verifies the effectiveness of multi-scale feature fusion, while the fourth one demonstrates
the necessity of overlap prediction."

ABLATION STUDIES,0.36885245901639346,"Additionally, we conducted five abla-
tion studies on KITTI for a better un-
derstanding of our fine matching, since
pose errors are better metrics to reflect
accuracy. The second experiment using
only sparse keypoints for registration
highlights the effectiveness of dense
registration, while the third one shows
the effect of learnable dense correspon-
dences compared to nearest neighbors.
The last three experiments report the
performance of sparse registration by
ablating the keypoint detector, the learnable sparse correspondences, and the compatibility graph
embedding, each demonstrating their necessity for accuracy. Despite these variations, all studies
maintain a 100% RR, showing the robustness of coarse matching."

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.3729508196721312,"In this paper, we present a novel consistency-aware spot-guided Transformer to achieve compact and
consistent coarse matching for point cloud registration. At the coarse matching stage, our consistency-
aware self-attention enhances the feature representations with sparse sampling from the geometric
compatibility graph. Additionally, our spot-guided cross-attention leverages local consistency to
guide the cross-attention to confident spots without interfering with irrelevant areas. Based on these
semi-dense and consistent coarse correspondences, a lightweight and scalable sparse-to-dense fine
matching module empowered by local attention can achieve accurate pose estimation without optimal
transport or hypothesis-and-selection pipelines. Our method has showcased state-of-the-art accuracy,
robustness, and efficiency for point cloud registration across different 3D sensors and scenarios,
which paves the way for large-scale real-time applications such as SLAM."

3DMatch [16] is a widely used RGBD point cloud dataset for 3D reconstruction,
including 62 scenes from 7-Scenes [51], RGB-D Scenes V2 [52], Analysis-by-Synthesis [53],
BundleFusion [54], SUN3D [55] and Halber et al. [56] with their licenses in Table 7, where 46
scenes are used for training, 8 scenes for validation and 8 scenes for testing. Input point clouds are
generated by fusing 50 consecutive depth frames collected by RGBD cameras using TSDF volumetric
fusion [57]. Different from the original 3DMatch [16] that only consists of point cloud pairs with
>30% overlaps, [20] also includes point cloud pairs with overlaps between 10% and 30% for training,
and it sets two benchmarks for performance evaluation, i.e., 3DMatch consisting of point cloud pairs
with >30% overlaps, and 3DLoMatch consisting of point cloud pairs with low overlap ratios between
10% and 30%. Following [12], we utilize the voxel grid down-sampling of 2.5cm voxel size for data
preprocessing, which picks the centroid as a down-sampled point when multiple points fall into a
common voxel grid. We leverage the data and evaluation protocols in [20] for training and testing."

compared with other methods based on dense descriptors or correspondences when using the same
number of sampled points for evaluation; (2) our method directly supervises the differential pose
estimator to learn virtual correspondences with confidence scores instead of explicit feature matching
and outlier rejection, hence our method inevitably retains many outliers which are acceptable for
registration but not likely to maintain advanced matching performance; (3) feature matching recall and
inlier ratio only reflect the matching performance which is not decisive for either accuracy (relative
pose errors) or robustness (registration recall) especially for RANSAC-free methods [12, 13, 28, 49]."

REFERENCES,0.7950819672131147,"Feature Matching Performance.
Nevertheless, this appendix presents IR and FMR in Table 8 to
demonstrate the feature matching performance of our method. For IR evaluation, we scale the inlier
confidences predicted by compatibility graph embedding to [0, 1] and discard the correspondences
with confidences < 0.1. As the number of keypoint correspondences after filtering is always less
than 1000, we only report the IR regarding ≤1000 correspondences. Even without filtering, the
number of keypoint correspondences is always less than 2500, hence we only report the FMR
regarding ≤2500 correspondences. Enjoying the merits of our coarse matching, keypoint detection,
and compatibility graph embedding, our method achieves the highest inlier ratio compared to all
sorts of baselines. As for FMR, our method performs on par with DiffusionPCR [30] on 3DMatch
and better than CoFiNet [11] on 3DLoMatch. However, our method performs worse than other
coarse-to-fine methods [12, 13, 28, 29, 49, 30] on 3DLoMatch, since it remains challenging to extract
enough keypoint correspondences in extremely low overlapping cases due to sparsity."

We demonstrate the accuracy of CAST for indoor RGB-D
point cloud registration by comparing it with various point cloud registration methods [15, 58, 59, 31,
32, 43, 60] in Table 9. All of the registration methods leverage the prevalent FCGF descriptor [8],
and FastMAC [60] uses a sampling ratio of 50%. For a fair comparison, we follow the evaluation
strategy of MAC [43] to re-compute the registration recall of our method, which is formulated as
the fraction of point cloud pairs with RTE<30cm and RRE<15°. Our method achieves the highest
registration recall and the lowest registration errors, suggesting its robustness and accuracy."

REFERENCES,0.8114754098360656,"Generalization Studies.
To extensively evaluate the generalizability of the proposed CAST in
unseen domains, we conduct a generalization experiment from the outdoor dataset KITTI [39] to
another outdoor dataset ETH [61]. Note that the KITTI and ETH datasets use Velodyne-64 3D LiDAR
and Hokuyo 2D LiDAR, respectively, leading to very different appearances and distributions of point
clouds. Hence, our generalization study is practical in applications and solid to demonstrate the
generalizability of different methods. For fairness, all methods adopt 30cm for voxel down-sampling,
and all methods involving RANSAC set the maximum iterations to be 50000 and the confidence to be
0.999 as the convergence criteria. To enhance the robustness, our method is combined with RANSAC
estimating an initial pose from 250 coarse correspondences to reject the outliers during fine matching,
and utilizes the global registration in GeoTransformer [12] to refine the pose estimate."
REFERENCES,0.8135245901639344,"We present the translation errors, rotation errors, and the registration recalls in Table 11. Our method
achieves satisfying accuracy and robustness, showcasing better generalizability than the coarse-to-fine
baseline GeoTransformer [12] and other point-wise descriptors [8, 1, 20]. We also compare the
our learnable compatibility graph embedding (CGE) with spectral matching (SM) [62] for outlier
rejection in our method. With RANSAC filtering out severe outliers in advance, spectral matching
can lead to better performance than learning-based CGE in unseen domains. Notably, all point-wise
methods including CAST exhibit lower registration recalls in generalization studies than patch-wise
local descriptor SpinNet [19] and BUFFER [48] incorporating patch-wise and point-wise features.
This is mainly because they adopt a feature pyramid network architecture to learn features with
abundant global context, which is detrimental for generalization [19]. Furthermore, we conduct an
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) experiment for CAST, which tunes the network by learning
to align a point cloud to itself after random rotation and cropping. The results indicate that our model
can easily adapt to an unseen domain and achieve robust and accurate performance after one epoch’s
unsupervised tuning (only 20 minutes on an NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU)."
REFERENCES,0.8155737704918032,"Experiment Statistical Significance.
Finally, Table 10 reports the standard deviations (1-sigma) of
our evaluation metrics, which are assumed to be Gaussian distributed. Despite the randomness from
voxel down-sampling and RANSAC, the performance of our method remains stable. Notably, the
runtime of some methods such as [8, 19, 50] in Table 3 are quite different from results in [48], since
we report the average runtime including data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature matching, and
pose estimation, while the source codes of these methods save some intermediate results such as
descriptors to avoid repeated calculation of the same point cloud in different pairs, which leads to
unfair runtime comparison."

Limitation"
REFERENCES,0.8319672131147541,"The main limitation of the proposed CAST is the sub-optimal performance in low overlapping
scenarios such as the 3DLoMatch benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods, which may be
ascribed to two aspects. (1) There is no effective outlier rejection for coarse matching as it is difficult
to search inliers from patch correspondences based on geometry consistency due to low resolution.
(2) Due to the sparsity and non-uniformity of keypoints, the inlier ratio of keypoint correspondences
still falls short of what is required for robust pose estimation without a hypothesis-and-selection
pipeline. Nevertheless, this RANSAC-free lightweight fine matching pipeline can achieve satisfying
performance in outdoor scenarios. Considering the superior PIR and PMR of our coarse matching,
we may directly exploit dense feature matching to enhance the robustness in low overlapping point
cloud registration scenarios as a future work."

consistent coarse correspondences from point clouds. In addition, we propose a lightweight fine
matching module for versatile and hierarchical point cloud registration, benefiting from the efficiency
of sparse keypoint matching and the accuracy of dense registration. Different from existing methods,
our fine matching is based on flexible local attention instead of optimal transport heavily relying on
patch-to-patch correspondences, thus allowing independent deployment without coarse matching.
Besides, the sparsity of keypoints ensures the efficiency of spatial consistency filtering."
REFERENCES,0.8381147540983607,"Enjoying these merits, this work not only achieves superior accuracy, efficiency, and robustness in

as SfM, SLAM, autonomous driving, or any other where point cloud registration plays a role. For
examples, the reconstruction of indoor scenes and objects from unlabeled 3D scans could benefit from
our work, which can precisely recover the rigid transformation between different scans. Additionally,
our fine matching may independently construct a real-time LiDAR-based or RGBD camera-based
odometry system for SLAM or SfM, as it is capable of efficient and reliable local data association
and accurate pose estimation between two large-scale point clouds with a strong pose prior, while our
coarse matching could be utilized in place recognition and global re-localization in SLAM."

(Sec. A.2) and the computational efficiency (Sec. 4), etc.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8770491803278688,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results."

figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards"
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9528688524590164,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper poses no such risks for misuse.
Guidelines:"
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9549180327868853,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets"
