ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.007874015748031496,"Conventional deep learning models have limited capacity in learning multiple
tasks sequentially. The issue of forgetting the previously learned tasks in continual
learning is known as catastrophic forgetting or interference. When the input data
or the goal of learning changes, a continual model will learn and adapt to the
new status. However, the model will not remember or recognise any revisits to
the previous states. This causes performance reduction and re-training curves
in dealing with periodic or irregularly reoccurring changes in the data or goals.
Dynamic approaches, which assign new neuron resources to the upcoming tasks,
are introduced to address this issue. However, most of the dynamic methods need
task information about the upcoming tasks during the inference phase to activate the
corresponding neurons. To address this issue, we introduce Task Conditional Neural
Network which allows the model to identify the task information automatically.
The proposed model can continually learn and embed new tasks into the model
without losing the information about previously learned tasks. We evaluate the
proposed model combined with the mixture of experts approach on the MNIST and
CIFAR100 datasets and show how it signiﬁcantly improves the continual learning
process without requiring task information in advance."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.023622047244094488,"The human brain can adapt and learn new knowledge in response to changing environments. Hoshi
et al. (1998) demonstrate that we can continually learn different tasks while retaining previously
learned variations of the same or similar phenomenon and give different reactions under different
contexts. Similarly, Asaad et al. (2000) have found that our neurons are task-independent. Under
different context, the neurons are ﬁred selectively with respect to the stimulus. In contrast, most of
the machine learning models, in a scalable way, are not capable of adapting to changing environments
quickly and automatically using artiﬁcial neurons corresponding to different tasks. Consequently,
conventional machine learning models tend to forget the previously learned task after learning a
new task. This scenario is known as catastrophic forgetting or interference in machine learning
(McCloskey & Cohen (1989))."
INTRODUCTION,0.031496062992125984,"Catastrophic interference problem in machine learning is one of the hurdles to implement a general
artiﬁcial intelligence learning systems (Legg & Hutter (2007)). Unable to learn several tasks, a model
should be trained with all the possible scenarios in advance. This requirement is intractable in practice
and is not inline with the continual learning models (Thrun & Mitchell (1995))."
INTRODUCTION,0.03937007874015748,"Continual machine learning algorithms change over time and adapt their parameters to data or learning
goals changes. We refer to the learning goal or a speciﬁc part of the data with a learning goal as a task.
The learning models are not often equipped with solutions to quickly adapt to the situations which
they have seen before if their parameters have signiﬁcantly changed over time by continual learning."
INTRODUCTION,0.047244094488188976,"A variety of continual learning methods have been proposed to solve the problems mentioned above.
Shin et al. (2017) proposed a memory-based approach which is to replay the trained samples to solve
the forgetting problem while learning a new task. Lee et al. (2017); Kirkpatrick et al. (2017); Zeng
et al. (2018) leverage the regularisation methods reduce the representational overlap of different tasks.
Dynamic network approaches assign extra neuron resources to new tasks (Yoon et al. (2017)). Most
of the existing solutions need to know all the task changes in advance, or this information is given"

to inference the task identity (Li et al. (2019); Lee et al. (2020))."
INTRODUCTION,0.07086614173228346,"In this work, we propose a novel method to overcome the catastrophic forgetting problem. We
leverage Misture of Experts (MoE) (Masoudnia & Ebrahimpour (2014)) to train the task-speciﬁc
models. One of the advantage of MoE is that we can use a shallower networks and utilise the capacity
as much as possible for each expert. Theoretically, the potential capacity of the combined networks is
inﬁnite. In other words, we do not need to initialise a giant network at the beginning of the training to
avoid learning further tasks without forgetting them. In each expert, we integrate the probabilistic
neural networks (Specht (1990)) and conventional neural networks (Haykin (1994)) to produce the
task likelihood. The ﬁnal prediction of each expert will be weighted by the task likelihood and
calculate the task conditional probabilities. We name our approach as Task Conditional Neural
Network (TCNN)."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.08661417322834646,"There are different approaches to address the forgetting problem in continual learning. Parisi et al.
(2019) categorise these approaches into three groups: Regularisation, Memory Replay and Dynamic
Network approaches."
RELATED WORK,0.09448818897637795,"The regularisation approaches ﬁnd the overlap of the parameter space between different tasks. One of
the popular algorithms in this group is Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) proposed by Kirkpatrick
et al. (2017). EWC avoids signiﬁcantly changing the parameters that are important to a learned task.
It assumes the weights have Gaussian distributions and approximates the posterior distribution of
the weights by the Laplace approximation. A similar idea is used in Incremental Moment Matching
(IMM) proposed by Lee et al. (2017). IMM ﬁnds the overlap of the parameter distributions by
smoothing the loss surface of the tasks. Zeng et al. (2018) address the forgetting problem by allowing
the weights to change within the same subspace of the previously learned task. Li & Hoiem (2018)
address the problem by using the knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. (2015)). They enforce the
prediction of the learned tasks to be similar to the new tasks (Parisi et al. (2019)). However, these
models require advance knowledge of the training tasks and the task changes."
RELATED WORK,0.10236220472440945,"Memory Replay methods mainly focus on interleaving the trained samples with the new tasks. A
pseudo-rehearsal mechanism proposed by Robins (1995) reduce the memory requirement to store the
training samples for each task. In a pseudo-rehearsal, instead of explicitly storing the entire training
samples, the training samples of previously learned tasks are drawn from a probabilistic distribution
model. Shin et al. (2017) propose an architecture consisting of a deep generative model and a task
solver. Similarly, Kamra et al. (2017) use a variational autoencoder to generate the previously trained
samples. However, this group of models are complex to train, and in real-world cases, the sampling
methods do not offer an efﬁcient solution for sporadic and rare occurrences. These models also often
require advance knowledge of the change occurring."
RELATED WORK,0.11023622047244094,"Dynamic Networks allocate new neurons to new tasks. Yoon et al. (2017) propose Dynamic Ex-
pandable Networks (DEN) to learn new tasks with new parameters continuously. Similarly, Serrà
et al. (2018) also allocate new parameters to learn new tasks. Masse et al. (2018) propose dynamic
networks Context Dependent Gating (XdG) which provides the task context information to train the
model. However, this group of models require the task information to be given to the model explicitly.
In other words, the model knows in advance which neurons should be activated to perform each test
task. To identify which neurons or experts should be used during the test state, Aljundi et al. (2017)
proposed the Expert Gate and Lee et al. (2020) proposed Continual Neural Dirichlet Process Mixture
(CN-DPM) leverage generative models to achieve the task-free continual learning, which does not
need the task identities in the test phase. For each task, the Expert Gate and CN-DPM need to train a
generator to distinguish the in-task and out-task samples. As the complexity of the dataset grows, the
extra demand including parameters and computational resources of training a generator increases.
Different from them, we introduce the probabilistic layer added into the discriminative model. Our
method saves the memory since we do not need an extra model which is a generator to recognise the
task identity. Furthermore, our approach can save the computational resources (the probabilistic layer
can be simultaneously trained with classiﬁcation tasks and we do not need to train a generator for
each expert)."

from the conventional neural networks, this model contains two heads performing estimating task
likelihood and classiﬁcation. The classiﬁcation head is connected to a classiﬁcation layer, which is
similar to a conventional neural network. The task likelihood head is connected to the probabilistic
layer. The probabilistic layers contains several kernels, each of which performs the function shown
in Equation 1. Where the f(·) is the function of hidden, zi is a vector representing the ith kernel,
zi has the same dimension with the output from previous layer, Σ is the covariance matrix of z1:n,
where n is the number of the kernels in the probabilistic layer. Calculating the covariance matrix
could be intractable due to the high dimension of z1:n. Since the kernels can be viewed as different

current task, and turns into training mode if it is unconﬁdent with the encountering task. We assume
the tasks are coming in sequence. To further analyse the performance of the model, we test the model

ANALYSING THE ESTIMATED DENSITY,0.5826771653543307,"As we mentioned in section 3.1, the kernels in the probabilistic layer act as anchors to distinguish
the in-task and out-task samples during the test phase. The hidden layers can be viewed as a feature
extractor to map the inputs to the corresponding kernels. If the expert observes the input beforehand,
the features extracted by the hidden layers should match the kernels in the probabilistic layer. In
contrast, the extracted features cannot match the existing kernels in the probabilistic layer if the
expert has not seen the input beforehand. To verify this, we take the ﬁrst expert in the split MNIST
experiment and visualise the mean of the sample distribution, which is extracted by the hidden
layers of the ﬁrst expert, from the ﬁrst and second tasks. To visualise the overall distribution, we
assume the kernels in the ﬁrst expert and the features extracted of the two classes follows bi-variate
Gaussian distributions. The results are shown in Figure 4. The distribution of the feature distributions
extracted from the samples from task 1 and the kernels from expert 1 are overlapped. In contrast,
the distribution of the feature distribution extracted from the samples from task 2 is signiﬁcantly
different from the kernels in expert 1. Based on the Equation 1, the task likelihood will be high if the
kernel can describe the extracted sample distributions perfectly, e.g. Figure 4a. Alternatively, the
task likelihood will be decreased if the kernels cannot describe the extracted sample distribution, e.g.

LIMITATIONS AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS,0.6220472440944882,"Figure 4: Difference between the extracted samples distribution and the kernels in the probabilistic
layers. We use the hidden layers of the ﬁrst expert to extract the features of the samples from task 1
and 2 respectively. The task likelihood is high if the two distributions are overlapped (e.g. Figure 4a,
where samples are from Task 1, kernels are from: expert 1). The task likelihood will be decreased if
they are different (e.g. Figure 4b, where samples are from Task 2, kernels are from: expert 1)."
LIMITATIONS AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS,0.6299212598425197,"therefore the number of parameters used can be reduced. As shown in Figure 5a, the number of
parameters used in TCNN is competitive to other methods after adding 20 experts."
LIMITATIONS AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS,0.6377952755905512,"Furthermore, Rusu et al. (2016); Yoon et al. (2017) re-use the neurons which have been trained with
previous tasks. TCNN can be integrated with these techniques to save the resource. For example,
we weighted sum the output features extracted by the convolutional layers of the previously learned
expert, and add it to the current extracted features progressively (Rusu et al. (2016)). Shown in
Equation 7, where fi(x) is the feature extracted by the ith expert, T is number of tasks, αi is trainable
weight parameter for ith expert, ˆfT (x) is the ﬁnal extracted features of expert T. Besides of that, we
can also share the parameters of the learned experts to the new experts directly. In this way, we do not
need to train the convolutional neural networks again but train a weighted vector α instead, shown
in Equation 8. We show the results in the Figure 5b, where the TCNN_progressive train the expert
progressively by Equation 7, the TCNN_share is we train the last expert by the Equation 8. After
combining with the techniques to reuse the exisiting neuron resources, the performance of the models
do not degrade and similar to the baseline TCNN. The results show that the TCNN can integrate with
these techniques to use the neuron resources efﬁciently and reduce the number of parameters for the
future experts."

LIMITATIONS AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS,0.6929133858267716,"Besides the parameter explosion, the inference time of TCNN increases with respect to the number of
tasks. During the inference phase, we have to iterate all the learned experts to give the ﬁnal prediction.
One possible solution for this is early existing paradigm. Instead of running the experts in parallel,
we put them in sequential manner. An expert will give a prediction if its conﬁdence above threshold,
or it passes the data to the next expert. We leave the improvement of TCNN and more comprehensive
experiments as future work."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.7322834645669292,"In this paper, we ﬁrst discuss the reasons for forgetting problem in machine learning when different
tasks are given to a model at different times. We demonstrate how providing or acquiring the learning
task information is essential to address this issue. We also present a challenge that we have in our
healthcare monitoring research and discuss how an automated and scalable model can solve this
issue in dynamic and changing environments. We then propose a Task Conditional Neural Network
(TCNN) model for continual learning of sequential tasks. TCNN is a novel expandable model that
utilises a probabilistic layer to estimate the task likelihood."
CONCLUSION,0.7401574803149606,"TCNN consists of several different experts corresponding to different tasks. The model can learn
and decide which expert should be chosen and activated under different tasks that are given to the
model, without having provided the task information in advance. TCNN can detect the changes
in the tasks and learn new tasks automatically. The proposed model implements these features by
using a probabilistic layer and measuring the task likelihood given a set of augmented samples
associated with a speciﬁc task. Our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in
terms of accuracy and the ability to learn the new tasks automatically. We hope this work can inspire
more studies on investigating continual learning methods under dynamic environments.The future
work will focus on transferring the knowledge between the experts, improving the task identiﬁcation
process, and deﬁning dynamic and adaptive activation functions."
