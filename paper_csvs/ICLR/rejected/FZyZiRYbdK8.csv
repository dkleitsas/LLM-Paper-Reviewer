ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.004310344827586207,"We propose a framework for learning calibrated uncertainties under domain shifts.
We consider the case where the source (training) distribution differs from the tar-
get (test) distribution. We detect such domain shifts through the use of binary
domain classiﬁer and integrate it with the task network and train them jointly end-
to-end. The binary domain classiﬁer yields a density ratio that reﬂects the close-
ness of a target (test) sample to the source (training) distribution. We employ it to
adjust the uncertainty of prediction in the task network. This idea of using the den-
sity ratio is based on the distributionally robust learning (DRL) framework, which
accounts for the domain shift through adversarial risk minimization. We demon-
strate that our method generates calibrated uncertainties that beneﬁt many down-
stream tasks, such as unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semi-supervised
learning (SSL). In these tasks, methods like self-training and FixMatch use uncer-
tainties to select conﬁdent pseudo-labels for re-training. Our experiments show
that the introduction of DRL leads to signiﬁcant improvements in cross-domain
performance. We also demonstrate that the estimated density ratios show agree-
ment with the human selection frequencies, suggesting a positive correlation with
a proxy of human perceived uncertainties."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01293103448275862,"Uncertainty estimation is an important machine learning problem that is central to trustworthy
AI (Tomsett et al., 2020; Antifakos et al., 2005). In addition, many important downstream applica-
tions rely on the correct estimation of uncertainties. This includes unsupervised domain adaptation
(UDA) (Zou et al., 2019) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) (Sohn et al., 2020) where they are
used to solicit conﬁdent pseudo-labels for re-training. In these applications, reliable pseudo-labels
help avoid error propagation and catastrophic failures in early iterations (Kumar et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.017241379310344827,"Obtaining reliable uncertainty estimation is challenging. In contrast to human annotation of labels,
obtaining the ground-truth uncertainties from real-world data can be costly or even infeasible. It
is also known that commonly used uncertainty proxies in deep neural networks, such as the soft-
max output, tend to give overconﬁdent estimates (Guo et al., 2017a). This overconﬁdence is further
ampliﬁed under domain shifts, where the target (test) domain and the source training domain differ
signiﬁcantly. Such distributional shifts tend to aggravate the existing issues in uncertainty estima-
tion, leading to wrong but overconﬁdent predictions on unfamiliar samples (Li & Hoiem, 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.021551724137931036,"Many methods have been proposed to calibrate the conﬁdence of deep learning models so that
the uncertainty level of a model prediction reﬂects the likelihood of the true event (Guo et al.,
2017a). Label smoothing is a popular approach to reduce overconﬁdence and to promote more
uniform outputs (Szegedy et al., 2016). Temperature scaling is another method where the logit
scores are rescaled by a calibrated temperature (Platt et al., 1999). Approaches such as Monte-Carlo
sampling (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) and Bayesian inference (Blundell et al., 2015; Riquelme et al.,
2018) model uncertainties from a Bayesian perspective but are computationally more expensive.
Even though these methods lead to more calibrated uncertainties, recent studies show that their
results cannot be fully trusted under domain shift (Snoek et al., 2019)."

data and the test data. Intuitively, if the test sample is highly unlikely in the training distribution,"

INTRODUCTION,0.09482758620689655,"To make our idea more concrete, recall that the probability output of a standard neural network for

INTRODUCTION,0.10775862068965517,"where Ps(x) and Pt(x) are the densities of a data sample under the source and target distributions,
respectively. When a target sample is close to the source domain (large Ps(x)/Pt(x)), the prediction
is conﬁdent. However, when a target sample x is far away from the source distribution (small
Ps(x)/Pt(x)), the conﬁdence is lowered and the prediction is closer to a uniform distribution. This
intuition is analogous to incorporating a sample-wise temperature to adjust the conﬁdence according
to the closeness of a test sample to the training distribution."
INTRODUCTION,0.11206896551724138,"Eq. (1) is based on the distributionally robust learning (DRL) framework. DRL is an adversarial
risk minimization framework that involves a two-player minimax game between a predictor and an
adversary (Gr¨unwald et al., 2004). While many previous DRL methods (Liu et al., 2020; Nakka
et al., 2020) operate in low dimensional spaces using kernel density estimators for the density ratio
estimation, we develop a DRL method to scale to real-world computer vision tasks, which is able to
produce calibrated uncertainties under domain shift. Our contributions are:"
INTRODUCTION,0.11637931034482758,"1) We propose a DRL method for uncertainty estimation under domain shift. We introduce a binary
domain classiﬁer network which learns to predict the density ratios between source and target do-
mains (See Fig. 1(a)). The domain classiﬁer and the target classiﬁer are trained simultaneously in an
end-to-end fashion. We also introduce a regularized DRL framework to further promote smoothed
model prediction and improve the calibration."
INTRODUCTION,0.1206896551724138,"2) We show that the estimated density ratio reﬂects the distance of a test sample from both training
and test distributions (Fig. 1(b)). Our experiments further empirically show that these estimates are
also correlated with human selection frequency, based on the available ground-truth labels in Ima-
geNetV2 (Recht et al., 2019a), which can be regarded as a proxy of human uncertainty perception."
INTRODUCTION,0.125,"3) We empirically show that the top-1 class predictions of DRL are more calibrated than the em-
pirical risk minimization (ERM) and the temperature scaling on Ofﬁce31 (Saenko et al., 2010),

with the predictor player minimizing a loss, while the adversary player maximizing the loss. The
adversary is allowed to perturb the labels, subject to certain feature-matching constraints to ensure

DIFFERENTIABLE DENSITY RATIO ESTIMATION
Estimating Ps(x)/Pt(x) (Sugiyama et al., 2012) can be challenging, especially in high-dimensional
spaces. Usually a plug-in estimator is used. But the plug-in estimates are usually sub-optimal for
downstream tasks due to the different objectives. We propose an end-to-end training procedure for
DRL such that the density ratio estimator is trained together with the target classiﬁer. The
key insight here is that we use two neural networks for classiﬁcation and differentiating the two
domains, respectively. See Fig. 1(a). We now ﬁrst introduce differentiable density ratio estimation

leveraged as the proxy to rank the reliability of pseudo labels, with the underlying assumption that
there exists a positive correlation between model conﬁdence and pseudo label quality. However,
such an assumption requires accurate uncertainty estimation to avoid false usage of wrong pseudo
labels which may poison the training. To this end, we incorporate DRL into these frameworks with

augmented data (Sohn et al., 2020). Here ‘weakly’ means simple ﬂip-and-shift data augmentation
while ‘strongly’ follows the same strategy with (Sohn et al., 2020). Using DRL’s prediction, we
propose DRSSL, which assigns pseudo-labels more conservatively. We plug DRL into Fixmatch

the better the model is calibrated."

ability and the actual outcome. For a fully calibrated classiﬁer, the conﬁdence should match the

more calibrated the method is. Our method gets more and more calibrated as conﬁdence increases."

0 when covariate shift holds. We can see that the gap decreases with self-training, which shows

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.5517241379310345,"Distributionally robust learning: Several different learning algorithms can be derived from this
framework (Liu & Ziebart, 2014; 2017; Chen et al., 2016; Fathony et al., 2016; 2018). One limitation
of this line of work is that it is only suitable for low-dimensional data. The other inconvenience is
that it requires the density ratio to be estimated beforehand. Our work instead deals with high-
dimensional data and estimates the density ratio along with the learning process. Another line of
work perturbs the covariate variable (Ben-Tal et al., 2013; Shaﬁeezadeh Abadeh et al., 2015; Sinha
et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2018; Najaﬁet al., 2019) and focuses on model robustness against adversarial
perturbations. In our work, we make DRL practical in high-dimensional vision tasks by introducing
an end-to-end trained domain classiﬁer."
RELATED WORK,0.5560344827586207,"UDA and SSL: There is a rich literature in UDA focusing on representation alignment between the
source and target domains (Fernando et al., 2014; Pan et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018;
Baktashmotlagh et al., 2013; Na et al., 2021). It is also prevalent to use a discriminator network to
differentiate two learned representations (adversarially) to locate such a feature space (Ganin et al.,
2016; Tzeng et al., 2017; Ajakan et al., 2014; Long et al., 2018; Sankaranarayanan et al., 2018).
Some other works focus on more speciﬁc shift assumptions, such as covariate shift (Shimodaira,
2000) and label shift (Lipton et al., 2018; Azizzadenesheli et al., 2019). For the covariate shift case,
even though various density ratio estimation methods were investigated before (Sugiyama et al.,
2012), only few works explore the possibility to apply them to high-dimensional data (Khan et al.,
2019; Moustakides & Basioti, 2019; Park et al., 2020). Recently, multiple self-training methods
have been proposed for UDA (Zou et al., 2018; 2019) and many theoretical understandings of self-
training are also developed (Kumar et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020c). Similarly, rich literature also
exist in pseudo-labeling for SSL (Berthelot et al., 2019; Arazo et al., 2020; Miyato et al., 2018; Sohn
et al., 2020). In this paper, we focus on utilizing DRL’s model uncertainty to help with choosing
better pseudo-labeled data from the target domain in UDA and cross-domain SSL."
RELATED WORK,0.5603448275862069,"Uncertainty quantiﬁcation with deep models: Bayesian methods largely contribute to comple-
menting deep learning with uncertainty quantiﬁcation (Gal, 2016; Welling & Teh, 2011; Kingma
& Welling, 2013; Louizos & Welling, 2017; Blundell et al., 2015; Riquelme et al., 2018; Gal &
Ghahramani, 2015; Gal et al., 2017; Kendall & Gal, 2017; Mandt et al., 2017). However, with a
large number of parameters, Bayesian deep learning may suffer from computational inefﬁciency.
Other calibration methods include temperature scaling (Platt et al., 1999; Guo et al., 2017b), deep
ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), calibration regression (Kuleshov et al., 2018), quantile
regression (Romano et al., 2019) and trainable calibration measure (Kumar et al., 2018). These
methods do not apply to our setting because we do not have access to the target labels. Recent work
on calibrating or uncertainties under domain shift either only focus on “using” but not “generating”
the uncertainties (Han et al., 2019; Lee & Lee, 2020; Kurmi et al., 2019) or focus on the importance
weighting setup (Park et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). In this paper, we generate more calibrated
uncertainties using the DRL framework, where the density ratios are inherent."

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION"
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION,0.5689655172413793,"In this paper, we have studied uncertainty estimation under distribution shift using the distribution-
ally robust learning framework. We demonstrate that density estimation can be integrated into the
learning process by using a domain classiﬁer. We propose differentiable density ratio estimation
and develop end-to-end training techniques for our proposed method. Using DRL’s more calibrated
model conﬁdence helps to generate better pseudo-labels for self-training in UDA and cross-domain
SSL. We also empirically demonstrate that the density ratios learned from our domain classiﬁer re-
ﬂect the hardness of an image, showing a positive correlation with the human selection frequencies.
In the future, we are interested in relaxing the assumptions made and study different shifts in the
DRL framework."
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION,0.5732758620689655,"Density ratio estimation: Our density ratios are estimated from a differentiable domain classiﬁer
and is not guaranteed to match the true density ratios. Thus our density ratios should not be used in
circumstances where true density ratios are absolutely required. However, we show that our density
ratios do reﬂect the relation between the two distributions and beneﬁt the downstream tasks."
