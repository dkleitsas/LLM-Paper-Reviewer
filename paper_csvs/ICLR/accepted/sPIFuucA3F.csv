ABSTRACT,0.0017211703958691911,"Offline policy learning (OPL) leverages existing data collected a priori for policy
optimization without any active exploration. Despite the prevalence and recent
interest in this problem, its theoretical and algorithmic foundations in function
approximation settings remain under-developed. In this paper, we consider this
problem on the axes of distributional shift, optimization, and generalization in
offline contextual bandits with neural networks. In particular, we propose a prov-
ably efficient offline contextual bandit with neural network function approxima-
tion that does not require any functional assumption on the reward. We show that
our method provably generalizes over unseen contexts under a milder condition
for distributional shift than the existing OPL works. Notably, unlike any other
OPL method, our method learns from the offline data in an online manner using
stochastic gradient descent, allowing us to leverage the benefits of online learning
into an offline setting. Moreover, we show that our method is more computa-
tionally efficient and has a better dependence on the effective dimension of the
neural network than an online counterpart. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical
effectiveness of our method in a range of synthetic and real-world OPL problems."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.0051635111876075735,"We consider the problem of offline policy learning (OPL) (Lange et al., 2012; Levine et al., 2020)
where a learner infers an optimal policy given only access to a fixed dataset collected a priori by
unknown behaviour policies, without any active exploration. There has been growing interest in this
problem recently, as it reflects a practical paradigm where logged experiences are abundant but an
interaction with the environment is often limited, with important applications in practical settings
such as healthcare (Gottesman et al., 2019; Nie et al., 2021), recommendation systems (Strehl et al.,
2010; Thomas et al., 2017), and econometrics (Kitagawa & Tetenov, 2018; Athey & Wager, 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.0068846815834767644,"Despite the importance of OPL, theoretical and algorithmic progress on this problem has been rather
limited. Specifically, most existing works are restricted to a strong parametric assumption of envi-
ronments such as tabular representation (Yin & Wang, 2020; Buckman et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2021;
Yin & Wang, 2021; Rashidinejad et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021) and more generally as linear models
(Duan & Wang, 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Tran-The et al., 2021). However, while the linearity assump-
tion does not hold for many problems in practice, no work has provided a theoretical guarantee and
a practical algorithm for OPL with neural network function approximation."

INTRODUCTION,0.01549053356282272,"many standard online policy learning methods unsuccessful (Fujimoto et al., 2019). To guarantee
an efficient learning under distributional shift, common analyses rely on a sort of uniform data cov-
erage assumptions (Munos & Szepesv´ari, 2008; Chen & Jiang, 2019; Brandfonbrener et al., 2021;
Nguyen-Tang et al., 2021) that require the offline policy to be already sufficiently explorative over
the entire state space and action space. To mitigate this strong assumption, a pessimism principle
that constructs a lower confidence bound of the reward functions for decision-making (Rashidinejad
et al., 2021) can reduce the requirement to a single-policy concentration condition that requires the
coverage of the offline policy only on the target policy. However, Rashidinejad et al. (2021) only
uses this condition for tabular representation and it is unclear whether complex environments such as
ones that require neural network function approximation can benefit from this condition. Moreover,
the single-policy concentration condition still requires the offline policy to be stationary (e.g., the
actions in the offline data are independent and depend only on current state). However, this might
not hold for many practical scenarios, e.g., when the offline data was collected by an active learner
(e.g., by an Q-learning algorithm). Thus, it remains unclear what is a minimal structural assumption
on the distributional shift that allows a provably efficient OPL algorithm."
INTRODUCTION,0.01721170395869191,"Optimization. Solving OPL often involves in fitting a model into the offline data via optimization.
Unlike in simple function approximations such as tabular representation and linear models where
closed-form solutions are available, OPL with neural network function approximation poses an addi-
tional challenge that involves a non-convex, non-analytical optimization problem. However, existing
works of OPL with function approximation ignore such optimization problems by assuming free ac-
cess to an optimization oracle that can return a global minimizer (Brandfonbrener et al., 2021; Duan
et al., 2021; Nguyen-Tang et al., 2021) or an empirical risk minimizer with a pointwise convergence
bound at an exponential rate (Hu et al., 2021). This is largely not the case in practice, especially in
OPL with neural network function approximation where a model is trained by gradient-based meth-
ods such as stochastic gradient descents (SGD). Thus, to understand OPL in more practical settings,
it is crucial to consider optimization in design and analysis. To our knowledge, such optimization
problem has not been studied in the context of OPL with neural network function approximation."
INTRODUCTION,0.0189328743545611,"Generalization. In OPL, generalization is the ability to generalize beyond the states (or contexts as
in the specific case of stochastic contextual bandits) observed in the offline data. In other words, an
offline policy learner with good generalization should obtain high rewards not only in the observed
states but also in the entire (unknown) state distribution. The challenge of generalization in OPL
is that as we learn from the fixed offline data, the learned policy has highly correlated structures
where we cannot directly use the standard concentration inequalities (e.g. Hoeffding’s inequality,
Bernstein inequality) to derive a generalization bound. The typical approaches to overcome this
difficulty are data splitting and uniform convergence. While data splitting splits the offline data
into disjoint folds to break the correlated structures (Yin & Wang, 2020), uniform convergence
establishes generalization uniformly over a class of policies learnable by a certain model (Yin et al.,
2021). However, in the setting where the offline data itself can have correlated structures (e.g., an
offline action can depend on the previous offline data) and the model used is sufficiently large that
renders a uniform convergence bound vacuous, neither the data splitting technique in (Yin & Wang,
2020) nor the uniform convergence argument in (Yin et al., 2021) yield a good generalization. Thus,
it is highly non-trivial to guarantee a strong generalization in OPL with neural network function
approximation from highly correlated offline data."
INTRODUCTION,0.020654044750430294,"In this paper, we consider the problem of OPL with neural network function approximation on the
axes of distributional shift, optimization and generalization via studying the setting of stochastic
contextual bandits with overparameterized neural networks. Specifically, we make three contribu-

INTRODUCTION,0.022375215146299483,"• First, we propose an algorithm that uses a neural network to model any bounded reward
function without assuming any functional form (e.g., linear models) and uses a pessimistic
formulation to deal with distributional shifts. Notably, unlike any standard offline learning
methods, our algorithm learns from the offline data in an online-like manner, allowing us
to leverage the advantages of online learning into offline setting."
INTRODUCTION,0.024096385542168676,"• Second, our theoretical contribution lies in making the generalization bound of OPL more

dition for distributional shifts. In particular, our algorithm uses stochastic gradient descent

INTRODUCTION,0.027538726333907058,"iteration. Moreover, the distributional shift condition in our analysis, unlike in the exist-
ing works, does not require the offline policy to be uniformly explorative or stationary.
Specifically, we prove that, under mild conditions with practical considerations above, our
algorithm learns the optimal policy with an expected error of ˜O(κ ˜d1/2n−1/2), where n
is the number of offline samples, κ measures the distributional shift, and ˜d is an effective
dimension of the neural network that is much smaller than the network capacity (e.g., the
network’s VC dimension and Rademacher complexity).
• Third, we evaluate our algorithm in a number of synthetic and real-world OPL benchmark
problems, verifying its empirical effectiveness against the representative methods of OPL."

ALGORITHM"
ALGORITHM,0.07056798623063683,"In this section, we present our algorithm, namely NeuraLCB (which stands for Neural Lower
Confidence Bound). A key idea of NeuraLCB is to use a neural network fW (xa) to learn the
reward function h(xa) and use a pessimism principle based on a lower confidence bound (LCB) of
the reward function (Buckman et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020) to guide decision-making. The details
of NeuraLCB are presented in Algorithm 1. Notably, unlike any other OPL methods, NeuraLCB
learns in an online-like manner. Specifically, at step t, Algorithm 1 retrieves (xt, at, rt) from the
offline data Dn, computes a lower confidence bound Lt for each context and action based on the cur-
rent network parameter W (t−1), extracts a greedy policy ˆπt with respect to Lt, and updates W (t)
by minimizing a regularized squared loss function Lt(W ) using stochastic gradient descent. Note
that Algorithm 1 updates the network using one data point at time t, does not use the last sample
(xn, an, rn) for decision-making and takes the average of an ensemble of policies {ˆπt}n
t=1 as its
returned policy. These are merely for the convenience of theoretical analysis. In practice, we can
either use the ensemble average, the best policy among the ensemble or simply the latest policy ˆπn
as the returned policy. At step t, we can also train the network on a random batch of data from Dt
(the “B-mode” variant as discussed in Section 6)."

both require coverage over the optimal policy. However, the remarkable difference is that, unlike
(Rashidinejad et al., 2021), the behaviour policy µ in our condition needs not to be stationary and the
concentration is only defined on the observed contexts; that is, at can be dependent on both xt and

how quickly the eigenvalues of H decays. For example, ˜d only depends on n logarithmically when
the eigenvalues of H have a finite spectrum (in this case ˜d is smaller than the number of spectrum

GENERALIZATION ANALYSIS,0.12048192771084337,"˜d, 1} · n−1/2). A detailed
proof for Theorem 4.1 is omitted to Section A. We make several notable remarks about our re-
sult. First, our bound does not scale linearly with p or √p as it would if the classical analyses
(Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011; Jin et al., 2020) had been applied. Such a classical bound is vacu-
ous for overparameterized neural networks where p is significantly larger than n. Specifically, the
online-like nature of NeuraLCB allows us to leverage a matrix determinant lemma and the notion of
effective dimension in online learning (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2020) which avoids
the dependence on the dimension p of the feature space as in the existing OPL methods such as (Jin
et al., 2020). Second, as our bound scales linearly with
p"
GENERALIZATION ANALYSIS,0.12220309810671257,"˜d where ˜d scales only logarithmically with
n in common cases (Yang et al., 2020), our bound is sublinear in such cases and presents a provably
efficient generalization. Third, our bound scales linearly with κ which does not depend on the cov-
erage of the offline data on other actions rather than the optimal ones. This eliminates the need for a
strong uniform data coverage assumption that is commonly used in the offline policy learning liter-
ature (Munos & Szepesv´ari, 2008; Chen & Jiang, 2019; Brandfonbrener et al., 2021; Nguyen-Tang
et al., 2021). Moreover, the online-like nature of our algorithm does not necessitate the stationar-
ity of the offline policy, allowing an offline policy with correlated structures as in many practical
scenarios. Note that Zhan et al. (2021) have also recently addressed the problem of off-policy eval-
uation with such offline adaptive data but used doubly robust estimators instead of direct methods
as in our paper. Fourth, compared to the regret bound for online learning setting in (Zhou et al.,
2020), we achieve an improvement by a factor of
p"
GENERALIZATION ANALYSIS,0.12392426850258176,"˜d while reducing the computational complexity
from O(n2) to O(n). On a more technical note, a key idea to achieve such an improvement is to
directly regress toward the optimal parameter of the neural network instead of toward the empirical
risk minimizer as in (Zhou et al., 2020)."
GENERALIZATION ANALYSIS,0.12564543889845095,"Finally, to further emphasize the significance of our theoretical result, we summarize and compare
it with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) sub-optimality bounds for OPL with function approximation in
Table 1. From the leftmost to the rightmost column, the table describes: the related works – the
function approximation – the types of algorithms where Pessimism means a pessimism principle
based on a lower confidence bound of the reward function while Greedy indicates being uncertainty-
agnostic (i.e., an algorithm takes an action with the highest predicted score in a given context) –
the optimization problems in OPL where Analytical means optimization has an analytical solution,
Oracle means the algorithm relies on an oracle to obtain the global minimizer, and SGD means
the optimization is solved by stochastic gradient descent – the sub-optimality bounds – the data
coverage assumptions where Uniform indicates sufficiently explorative data over the context and
action spaces, SPC is the single-policy concentration condition, and eSPC is the empirical SPC
– the nature of data generation required for the respective guarantees where I (Independent) means
that the offline actions must be sampled independently while D (Dependent) indicates that the offline
actions can be dependent on the past data. It can be seen that our result has a stronger generalization
under the most practical settings as compared to the existing SOTA generalization theory for OPL.
We also remark that the optimization design and guarantee in NeuraLCB (single data point SGD)
are of independent interest that do not only apply to the offline setting but also to the original online
setting in (Zhou et al., 2020) to improve their regret and optimization complexity."

analyses in practical settings."
RELATED WORK,0.16006884681583478,"To deal with nonlinear rewards without making strong functional assumptions, other approaches

Moreover, these approaches have time complexity scaled linearly with the number of experts, rely
the regret on an oracle, and have cubic computational complexity, respectively, while our method

ral networks, in the sense that both algorithms use neural networks, learn with a streaming data
and construct a (lower and upper, respectively) confidence bound of the reward function to guide
decision-making. Besides the apparent difference of offline and online policy learning problems,
the notable difference of NeuraLCB from NeuralUCB is that while NeuralUCB trains a new neu-
ral network from scratch at each iteration (for multiple epochs), NeuraLCB trains a single neural
network completely online. That is, NeuraLCB updates the neural network in light of the data at
a current iteration from the trained network of the previous iteration. Such optimization scheme in
NeuraLCB greatly reduces the computational complexity from O(n2) 1 to O(n), while still guaran-
teeing a provably efficient algorithm. Moreover, NeuraLCB achieves a suboptimality bound with a
better dependence on the effective dimension than NeuralUCB."

RESULTS"
RESULTS,0.24612736660929432,"Figure 1 and 2 show the expected sub-optimality of all algorithms on synthetic datasets and real-
world datasets, respectively. First, due to the non-linearity of the reward functions, methods with
linear models (LinLCB, NeuralLinLCB, NeuralLinGreedy, and KernLCB) fail in almost all tasks
(except that LinLCB and KernLCB have competitive performance in Mushroom and Adult, respec-
tively). In particular, linear models using neural network features without training (NeuralLinLCB
and NeuralLinGreedy) barely work in any datasets considered here. In contrast, our method Neu-
raLCB outperforms all the baseline methods in all tasks. We remark that NeuralGreedy has a sub-
stantially lower sub-optimality in synthetic datasets (and even a comparable performance with Neu-
raLCB in h1) than linear models, suggesting the importance of using trainable neural representation
in highly non-linear rewards instead of using linear models with fixed feature extractors. On the
other hand, our method NeuraLCB outperforms NeuralGreedy in real-world datasets by a large mar-
gin (even though two methods are trained exactly the same but different only in decision-making),
confirming the effectiveness of pessimism principle in these tasks. Second, KernLCB performs
reasonably in certain OPL tasks (Adult and slightly well in Statlog and MNIST), but the cubic com-
putational complexity of kernel methods make it less appealing in OPL with offline data at more than
moderate sizes. Note that due to such cubic computational complexity, we follow (Riquelme et al.,
2018; Zhou et al., 2020) to learn the kernel in KernLCB for only the first 1, 000 samples and keep
the fitted kernel for the rest of the data (which explains the straight line of KernLCB after n = 1, 000
in our experiments). Our method NeuraLCB, on the other hand, is highly computationally efficient
as the computation scales only linearly with n (even in the B-mode – a slight modification of the
original algorithm to include batch training). In fact, in the real-world datasets above, the S-mode
(which trains in a single data point for one SGD step at each iteration) outperforms the B-mode, fur-
ther confirming the effectiveness of the online-like nature in NeuraLCB. In Section F, we reported
the performance of S-mode and B-mode together and evaluated on dependent offline data."

goal is to predict the state of the radiator subsystem of the shuttle. There are total K = 7
states to predict where approximately 80% of the data belongs to one state. A learner
receives a reward of 1 if it selects the correct state and 0 otherwise."

database. Following (Riquelme et al., 2018), we use the K = 14 different occupations as
actions and d = 94 covariates as contexts. As in the Statlog data, a learner obtains a reward
of 1 for making the right prediction, and 0 otherwise."

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS"

DEPENDENT DATA"
I,0.9397590361445783,"As the sub-optimality guarantee in Theorem 4.1 does not require the offline policy to be stationary,
we evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm and the baselines on a new setup of offline
data collection that represents dependent actions. In particular, instead of using a stationary policy
to collect offline actions as in Section 6, here we used an adaptive policy µ defined as"
I,0.9414802065404475,"µ(a|Dt−1, xt) = (1 −ϵ) ∗π∗(a|xt) + ϵ ∗πLinUCB(a|Dt−1, xt),"
I,0.9432013769363167,"where π∗is the optimal policy and πLinUCB is the linear UCB learner (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011).
This weighted policy makes the collected offline data at dependent on Dt−1 while making sure that
the offline data has a sufficient coverage over the data of the optimal policy, as LinUCB does not
perform well in several non-linear data. We used ϵ = 0.9 in this experiment."
I,0.9449225473321858,"The results on Statlog and MNIST are shown in Figure 3. We make two important observations.
First, on this dependent data, the baseline methods with linear models (LinLCB, NeuralLinLCB and
NeuralLinGreedy) 3 perform almost as bad as when they learn on the independent data in Figure
2, suggesting that linear models are highly insufficient to learn complex rewards in real-world data,
regardless of how offline data were collected. Secondly, the main competitor of our method, Neu-
ralGreedy suffers an apparent performance degradation (especially in a larger dataset like MNIST)
while NeuraLCB maintains a superior performance, suggesting the effectiveness of pessimism in
our method on dealing with offline data and the robustness of our method toward dependent data."

issue."

S-MODE VERSUS B-MODE TRAINING"
I,0.9672977624784854,"As in Section 6 we implemented two different training modes: S-mode (Algorithm 1) and B-mode
(Algorithm 7). We compare the empirical performances of S-mode and B-mode on various datasets.
As this variant is only applicable to NeuralGreedy and NeuraLCB, we only depict the performances
of these algorithms. The results on Cosine (synthetic dataset), Statlog, Adult and MNIST are shown
in Figure 4."
I,0.9690189328743546,"We make the following observations, which are consistent with the conclusion in the main paper
while giving more insights. While the B-mode outperforms the S-mode on Cosine, the S-mode
significantly outperforms the B-mode in all the tested real-world datasets. Moreover, the B-mode of
NeuraLCB outperforms or at least is compatible to the S-mode of NeuralGreedy in the real-world
datasets. First, these observations suggest the superiority of our method on the real-world datasets.
Second, to explain the performance difference of S-mode and B-mode on synthetic and real-world
datasets in our experiment, we speculate that the online-like nature of our algorithm tends to reduce
the need of B-mode in practical datasets because B-mode in the streaming data might cause over-
fitting (as there could be some data points in the past streaming that has been fitted for multiple
times). In synthetic and simple data such as Cosine, over-fitting tends to associate with strong
prediction of the underlying reward function as the simple synthetic reward function such as Cosine
is sufficiently smooth, unlike practical reward functions in the real-world datasets."
