ABSTRACT,0.0,"Abstract—In today’s quest for wealth, individuals are exploring
investment opportunities beyond traditional bank deposits to
maximize their returns. Gold and Bitcoin have emerged as pop-
ular investment products due to their price volatility. However,
making informed investment decisions based on expected price
fluctuations can be challenging. Market traders aim to capitalize
on price differences through buying and selling assets, such as
gold and Bitcoin, to maximize client returns. In this study, we
analyze daily price data of Bitcoin from November 9, 2016, to
October 21, 2021, and gold prices on market trading days. Our
objective is to develop a mathematical model that determines op-
timal investment strategies for cash, gold, and Bitcoin portfolios
on a daily basis. We use price prediction models, including the
second-order moving average method, second exponential sliding
prediction method, and gray prediction model, to forecast the
prices of gold and Bitcoin. Then a decision model is made to
maximize the gain.

INTRODUCTION,0.00980392156862745,I. INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTION,0.0196078431372549,"The desire for wealth is inherent in every individual. When
it comes to idle assets, mere reliance on bank deposits to
generate interest is often unsatisfactory. Instead, individuals
aspire to engage in rational investments that yield maximum
benefits. In this context, gold and bitcoin have emerged as
trendy investment products characterized by their price volatil-
ity. However, making decisions based on the anticipated price
fluctuations of bitcoin over a certain period poses considerable
challenges [1]–[5].
Professional market traders, who profit from price differ-
entials through buying and selling activities, have embraced
the opportunity presented by unstable assets such as gold
and bitcoin. [9], [11]By engaging in transactions involving
these assets, they aim to maximize the overall income of their
clients. To address this investment scenario, we have access
to historical bitcoin price data from November 9, 2016, to
October 21, 2021, as well as gold price data on trading days.
Our objective now is to establish a mathematical model that
utilizes the past daily price fluctuations to inform the optimal
decisions of buying, holding, or selling assets within cash,
gold, and bitcoin portfolios on a daily basis.
Our investment endeavor commences with an initial cash
amount of $1000 on November 9, 2016. Throughout the five-
year trading period, traders will manage a portfolio denoted as
[C, G, B], representing the allocation of funds in US dollars,
troy ounces of gold, and bitcoin, respectively. The initial state
of the portfolio is [1000, 0, 0], indicating an initial principal
of $1000. Each transaction, whether a purchase or sale, incurs
a commission fee expressed as a percentage of the transaction"
INTRODUCTION,0.029411764705882353,"amount, denoted as α. Holding assets, however, does not incur
any commission fees.
To formulate an optimal investment strategy that maximizes
the benefits of limited assets, it is imperative to conduct
a detailed analysis based on price trend predictions. Given
the significant fluctuations observed in the prices of gold
and bitcoin, we initially focus on predicting their future
price trends using historical price data. Subsequently, these
predictions will guide our investment decisions. In the first part
of our analysis, we employ the second-order moving average
method [12]–[15], the second exponential sliding prediction
method [16]–[19], and the gray prediction model [20]–[22]
to forecast the prices of gold and bitcoin. By calculating
their respective forecast curves and comparing them with the
actual price curves, we can ascertain the efficacy of these
prediction techniques. Subsequently, we construct a decision-
making model that guides investment actions, including buying
or selling gold on gold trading days and buying or selling
bitcoin on bitcoin trading days, with the aim of optimizing
investment outcomes."
LIT REVIEW,0.0392156862745098,II. ASSUMPTIONS AND NOTATIONS
LIT REVIEW,0.049019607843137254,"• Assume that the closing price of a troy ounce in US
dollars is the gold trading price for that day. The data
given in the question is limited, and only 1 gold price is
given for each day in the market trading day. Therefore,
we assume that the price of gold is traded at the closing
price given for each day."
LIT REVIEW,0.058823529411764705,"• On the same day, gold and bitcoin can be held, bought,
or sold in only one case. Since the price fluctuations of
gold and bitcoin are measured in days, if we choose to
sell A and buy B, it is equivalent to selling A-B. (when
A > B)"
LIT REVIEW,0.06862745098039216,"• We assume that the transaction is done instantaneously.
Because the price of gold and bitcoin fluctuates irregu-
larly over a certain period, it is completely meaningless
to predict price changes when the observation time is too
short. So for a certain period, we do not invest and keep
our cash holdings. Next, let’s assume that we can get a
more accurate prediction from day m onwards."
