ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.002898550724637681,"Solving the Schr¨odinger equation is key to many quantum mechanical properties.
However, an analytical solution is only tractable for single-electron systems. Re-
cently, neural networks succeeded at modeling wave functions of many-electron
systems. Together with the variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) framework, this led
to solutions on par with the best known classical methods. Still, these neural
methods require tremendous amounts of computational resources as one has to
train a separate model for each molecular geometry. In this work, we combine
a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a neural wave function to simultaneously
solve the Schr¨odinger equation for multiple geometries via VMC. This enables us
to model continuous subsets of the potential energy surface with a single training
pass. Compared to existing state-of-the-art networks, our Potential Energy Sur-
face Network (PESNet) speeds up training for multiple geometries by up to 40
times while matching or surpassing their accuracy. This may open the path to
accurate and orders of magnitude cheaper quantum mechanical calculations."

INTRODUCTION,0.017391304347826087,"In recent years, machine learning gained importance
in computational quantum physics and chemistry to
accelerate material discovery by approximating quan-
tum mechanical (QM) calculations (Huang & von
Lilienfeld, 2021).
In particular, a lot of work has
gone into building surrogate models to reproduce
QM properties, e.g., energies.
These models learn
from datasets created using classical techniques such
as density functional theory (DFT) (Ramakrishnan
et al., 2014; Klicpera et al., 2019) or coupled clus-
ters (CCSD) (Chmiela et al., 2018). While this ap-
proach has shown great success in recovering the
baseline calculations, it suffers from several disad-
vantages. Firstly, due to the tremendous success of
graph neural networks (GNNs) in this area, the regres-
sion target quality became the limiting factor for accu-
racy (Klicpera et al., 2019; Qiao et al., 2021; Batzner
et al., 2021), i.e., the network’s prediction is closer to
the data label than the data label is to the actual QM
property. Secondly, these surrogate models are subject to the usual difficulties of neural networks
such as overconfidence outside the training domain (Pappu & Paige, 2020; Guo et al., 2017)."
INTRODUCTION,0.020289855072463767,"In orthogonal research, neural networks have been used as wave function Ans¨atze to solve the sta-
tionary Schr¨odinger equation (Kessler et al., 2021; Han et al., 2019). These methods use the vari-
ational Monte Carlo (VMC) (McMillan, 1965) framework to iteratively optimize a neural wave
function to obtain the ground-state electronic wave function of a given system. Chemists refer to
such methods as ab-initio, whereas the machine learning community may refer to this as a form of
self-generative learning as no dataset is required. The data (electron positions) are sampled from the"

This approach has shown great success as multiple authors report results outperforming the tradi-
tional ‘gold-standard’ CCSD on various systems (Pfau et al., 2020; Hermann et al., 2020). However,
these techniques require expensive training for each geometry, resulting in high computational re-
quirements and, thus, limiting their application to small sets of configurations."
INTRODUCTION,0.028985507246376812,"In this work, we accelerate VMC with neural wave functions by proposing an architecture that solves
the Schr¨odinger equation for multiple systems simultaneously. The core idea is to predict a set of pa-
rameters such that a given wave function, e.g., FermiNet (Pfau et al., 2020), solves the Schr¨odinger
equation for a specific geometry. Previously, these parameters were obtained by optimizing a sep-
arate wave function for each geometry. We improve this procedure by generating the parameters
with a GNN, as illustrated in Figure 1. This enables us to capture continuous subsets of the potential
energy surface in one training pass, removing the need for costly retraining. Additionally, we take
inspiration from supervised surrogate networks and enforce the invariances of the energy to physical
symmetries such as translation, rotation, and reflection (Sch¨utt et al., 2018). While these symmetries
hold for observable metrics such as energies, the wave function itself may not have these symme-
tries. We solve this issue by defining a coordinate system that is equivariant to the symmetries of the
energy. In our experiments, our Potential Energy Surface Network (PESNet) consistently matches
or surpasses the results of the previous best neural wave functions while training less than
1
40 of the
time for high-resolution potential energy surface scans."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.034782608695652174,"Molecular property prediction has seen a surge in publications in recent years with the goal of
predicting QM properties such as the energy of a system. Classically, features were constructed by
hand and fed into a machine learning model to predict target properties (Christensen et al., 2020;
Behler, 2011; Bart´ok et al., 2013). Lately, GNNs have proven to be more accurate and took over
the field (Yang et al., 2019; Klicpera et al., 2019; Sch¨utt et al., 2018). As GNNs approach the
accuracy limit, recent work focuses on improving generalization by integrating calculations from
computational chemistry. For instance, QDF (Tsubaki & Mizoguchi, 2020) and EANN (Zhang
et al., 2019) approximate the electron density while OrbNet (Qiao et al., 2020) and UNiTE (Qiao
et al., 2021) include features taken from QM calculations. Another promising direction is ∆-ML
models, which only predict the delta between a high-accuracy QM calculation and a faster low-
accuracy one (Wengert et al., 2021). Despite their success, surrogate models lack reliability. Even
if uncertainty estimates are available (Lamb & Paige, 2020; Hirschfeld et al., 2020), generalization
outside of the training regime is unpredictable (Guo et al., 2017)."
RELATED WORK,0.03768115942028986,"While such supervised models are architecturally related, they pursue a fundamentally different
objective than PESNet. Where surrogate models approximate QM calculations from data, this work
focuses on performing the exact QM calculations from first principles."
RELATED WORK,0.04057971014492753,"Neural wave function Ans¨atze in combination with the VMC framework have recently been pro-
posed as an alternative (Carleo & Troyer, 2017) to classical self-consistent field (SCF) methods such
as Hartree-Fock, DFT, or CCSD to solve the Schr¨odinger equation (Szabo & Ostlund, 2012). How-
ever, early works were limited to small systems and low accuracy (Kessler et al., 2021; Han et al.,
2019; Choo et al., 2020). Recently, FermiNet (Pfau et al., 2020) and PauliNet(Hermann et al., 2020)
presented more scalable approaches and accuracy on par with the best traditional QM computations.
To further improve accuracy, Wilson et al. (2021) coupled FermiNet with diffusion Monte-Carlo
(DMC). But, all these methods need to be trained for each configuration individually. To address
this issue, weight-sharing has been proposed to reduce the time per training, but this was initially
limited to non-fermionic systems (Yang et al., 2020). In a concurrent work, Scherbela et al. (2021)
extend this idea to electronic wave functions. However, their DeepErwin model still requires sepa-
rate models for each geometry, does not account for symmetries and achieves lower accuracy, as we
show in Section 4."

METHOD,0.09855072463768116,"Firstly, to solve the Schr¨odinger equation, we leverage the VMC framework, i.e., we iteratively
update our wave function model (WFModel) until it converges to the ground-state electronic wave
function. The WFModel ψθ(−→r ) : RN×3 7→R is a function parametrized by θ that maps electron
configurations to amplitudes. It must obey the Fermi-Dirac statistics, i.e., the sign of the output must
flip under the exchange of two electrons of the same spin. As we cover in Section 3.4, the WFModel
is essential for sampling electron configurations and computing energies."
METHOD,0.10144927536231885,"Secondly, we extend this to multiple geometries by introducing a GNN that reparametrizes the WF-
Model. In reference to meta-learning, we call this the MetaGNN. It takes the nuclei coordinates
−→
Rm and charges Zm and outputs subsets ω, ωm ⊂θ, m ∈{1, . . . , M} of WFModel’s parameters.
Thanks to message passing, the MetaGNN can capture the full 3D geometry of the nuclei graph."
METHOD,0.10434782608695652,"Lastly, as we prove in Appendix A, to predict energies invariant to rotations and reflections the wave
function needs to be equivariant. We accomplish this by constructing an equivariant coordinate
system E = [−→e 1, −→e 2, −→e 3] based on the principle component analysis (PCA)."
METHOD,0.1072463768115942,"Together, these components form PESNet, whose architecture is shown in Figure 2. Since sam-
pling and energy computations only need the WFModel, a single forward pass of the MetaGNN is
sufficient for each geometry during evaluation. Furthermore, its end-to-end differentiability facil-
itates optimization, see Section 3.4, and we may benefit from better generalization thanks to our
equivariant wave function (Elesedy & Zaidi, 2021; Kondor & Trivedi, 2018)."

put all results into perspective, we always include highly accurate classical reference calculations.

its multi-reference nature, i.e., single reference methods such as CCSD(T) overestimate the transi-
tion barrier (Lyakh et al., 2012). In contrast, PauliNet and FermiNet had success at modelling this
challenging system. Naturally, we are interested in how well PESNet can estimate the transition
barrier. To be comparable to Spencer et al. (2020), we increased the number of determinants to 32
and the single-stream size to 512. Similar to PauliNet Hermann et al. (2020), we found PESNet to
occasionally converge to a higher energy for the transition state depending on the initialization and
pretraining. To avoid this, we pick a well-initialized model by training 5 models for 1000 iterations
and then continue the rest of the optimization with the model yielding the lowest energy."

EQUIVARIANT NEURAL NETWORKS AS WAVE FUNCTIONS"
REFERENCES,0.782608695652174,"Here, we want to briefly discuss why equivariant neural networks as proposed by Thomas et al.
(2018) or Batzner et al. (2021) are no alternative to our equivariant coordinate system. The issue is
the same as for regular GNNs (Klicpera et al., 2019), namely that such networks can only represent
spherically symmetric functions for atomic systems which, as discussed in Section 3.3, is insufficient
for wave functions. While this is obvious for regular GNNs, as they operate only on inter-particle
distances rather than vectors, equivariant neural networks take advantage of higher SO(3) representa-
tions. However, if one would construct the orbitals ϕ(−→r ) = [ϕ1(−→r ), . . . , ϕN(−→r )] by concatenating

resolved by applying a nonlinear function on the distances in Equation 12."
REFERENCES,0.8463768115942029,"The occurrence of these edge cases leads us to question: ‘Why can we not design a unique coordinate
system for each geometry?’. While we ideally would want an equivariant coordinate system that
changes smoothly with changes in the geometry, it is impossible. We show a counter example of
this in Figure 8c where we see a system of 3 nuclei. In their starting configuration, one can uniquely
define two axes as indicated by the colored arrows. But, when moving the leftmost nuclei such that
it is in line with the other two nuclei one is left with only one uniquely defined direction as there is
no way to differentiate between any orthogonal vector and the blue one. By moving the center nuclei
to the right, we again can define two axes for this system, though, one axis is flipped compared to
the initial state. So, we neither can define a smoothly changing coordinate system nor a unique one
for every system. However, in practice, we do not need a smoothly changing one but only a unique
one. While this is already unattainable as shown by the central figure, we also want to stress that
any arbitrary orthogonal vector is equivalent due to the symmetries of the system. Considering these
aspects, we believe that our coordinate system definition is sufficient in most scenarios."

by moving within their bin. This procedure ensures that our model is not restricted to a discrete set of

within the training domain without retraining. But, we only evaluate PESNet on configurations

2.5 mEh and 10.5 mEh, respectively. Moreover, the MetaGNN enables us to account for symme-
tries of the energy while the WFModel itself is only invariant w.r.t. to translation but not to rotation,
reflection, and reindexing of nuclei."
REFERENCES,0.9594202898550724,"Table 4 shows the impact of the number of determinants on the average energy for the systems
from Section 4. For small hydrogen-based systems, the number of determinants is mostly irrelevant,
while larger numbers of determinants improve performance for nitrogen. But, this does not seem
to carry over to cyclobutadiene. While the total estimated energy is higher for the larger model, we
noticed that it is significantly faster at converging the transition barrier. Figure 9 illustrates this by
comparing the convergence of the 16 and 32 determinant models."
REFERENCES,0.9623188405797102,"Increasing the single-stream size does not seem to result in any benefit for most models as Table 5
shows. Again, the hydrogen systems are mostly unaffected by this hyperparameter while nitrogen
benefits from larger hidden dimensions but cyclobutadiene converges worse. We suspect that this
is due to the optimization problem becoming significantly harder. Firstly, increasing the WFModel
increases the number of parameters the MetaGNN has to predict. Secondly, we estimate the inverse
of the Fisher with a finite fixed-sized batch but the Fisher grows quadratically with the number of
parameters which also grow quadratically with the single size stream."

TIME PER ITERATION"
REFERENCES,0.9681159420289855,"While the main document already covers the time it took to reproduce the results from the figures,
we want to use this appendix to provide more details on this. Table 6 lists the time per iteration for a
single model instead of the whole training time to reproduce the potential energy surfaces as in Ta-
ble 1. While we find these numbers to be misleading we still want to disclose them to support open
research. The main issue with these numbers is that they do not take the quality of the update into
account, e.g., PauliNet and DeepErwin are trained with Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014), FermiNet with
K-FAC (Martens & Grosse, 2015), and PESNet with CG-computed natural gradient (Neuscamman
et al., 2012). This has implications on the number of iterations one has to train. For Table 1 in the
main body, we assumed that PauliNet is trained for 10000 iterations (Hermann et al., 2020), Deep-
Erwin for 7000 iterations (Scherbela et al., 2021), FermiNet for 200000 iterations (Pfau et al., 2020),"

going to produce similar results to FermiNet and PESNet on the more complex nitrogen molecule or
cyclobutadiene in 10000 or 7000 iterations. This is further discussed in Appendix G. When viewing
these results, one also has to keep in mind the different quality of the results, e.g., FermiNet and
PESNet strictly outperform PauliNet and DeepErwin on all systems. Another potential issue arises
due to the choice of deep learning framework the models are implemented in. It has been shown
that JAX works very well for computing the kinetic energy (Spencer et al., 2020) which usually is
the largest workload when computing an update."

CONVERGENCE"
REFERENCES,0.9971014492753624,"When choosing a method to solve the Schr¨odinger equation one has to pick between accuracy and
speed. For classical methods, this might be the difference between choosing DFT, CCSD(T), or FCI.
In the neural VMC setting, one way to reflect this is by choosing the number of training steps. To
better investigate this, we present convergence graphs for H4, H+
4 , H10, and N2 in Figure 10. For
cyclobutadiene, we can see the convergence of different configurations of PESNet in Figure 9. One
can see that our network converges quite quickly on hydrogen-based systems such as the hydrogen
rectangle, H+
4 , or the hydrogen chain. For these small systems, PESNet surpasses PauliNet’s and
DeepErwin’s accuracy in less than 8000 training steps, reducing the training times to 2.9h, 3.2h, and
8.7h, respectively. In less than 16000 steps, about 17.4h of training, PESNet surpasses FermiNet on
the hydrogen chain. For more complicated molecules such as N2 and cyclobutadiene, the training
requires more iterations to converge. So, we may also expect the extrapolated numbers from Table 1
for PauliNet to be an optimistic estimate."
