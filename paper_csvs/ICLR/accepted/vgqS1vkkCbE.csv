ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0033003300330033004,"Reinforcement learning can train policies that effectively perform complex tasks.
However for long-horizon tasks, the performance of these methods degrades with
horizon, often necessitating reasoning over and chaining lower-level skills. Hier-
archical reinforcement learning aims to enable this by providing a bank of low-
level skills as action abstractions. Hierarchies can further improve on this by ab-
stracting the space states as well. We posit that a suitable state abstraction should
depend on the capabilities of the available lower-level policies. We propose Value
Function Spaces: a simple approach that produces such a representation by using
the value functions corresponding to each lower-level skill. These value functions
capture the affordances of the scene, thus forming a representation that compactly
abstracts task relevant information and robustly ignores distractors. Empirical
evaluations for maze-solving and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our
approach improves long-horizon performance and enables better zero-shot gener-
alization than alternative model-free and model-based methods."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.009900990099009901,"For an agent to perform complex tasks in realistic environments, it must be able to effectively reason
over long horizons, and parse high-dimensional observations to infer the contents of a scene and
its affordances. It can do so by constructing a compact representation that is robust to distractors
and suitable for planning and control. Consider, for instance, a robot rearranging objects on a desk.
To succcessfully solve the task, the robot must learn to sequence a series of simple skills, such as
picking and placing objects and opening drawers, and interpret its observations to determine which
skills are most appropriate. This requires the ability to understand the capabilities of these simpler
skills, as well as the ability to plan to execute them in the correct order."
INTRODUCTION,0.013201320132013201,"Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) aims to enable this by leveraging abstraction, which
simpliﬁes the higher-level control or planning problem. Typically, this is taken to mean abstraction
of actions in the form of primitive skills (e.g., options (Sutton et al., 1999)). However, signiﬁcantly
simplifying the problem for the higher level requires abstraction of both states and actions. This is
particularly important with rich sensory observations, where standard options frameworks provide a
greatly abstracted state space, but do not simplify the perception or estimation problem. The nature
of the ideal state abstraction in HRL is closely tied to the action abstraction, as the most suitable ab-
straction of state should depend on the kinds of decisions that the higher-level policy needs to make,
which in turn depends on the actions (skills) available to it. This presents a challenge in designing
HRL methods, because it is difﬁcult to devise a state abstraction that is both highly abstracted (and
therefore removes many distractors) and still sufﬁcient to make decisions for long-horizon tasks.
This challenge differs markedly from representation learning problems in other domains, like com-
puter vision and unsupervised learning (Schroff et al., 2015; van den Oord et al., 2018; Chen et al.,
2020), since it is intimately tied to the capabilities exposed to the agent via its skills."
INTRODUCTION,0.0165016501650165,"We therefore posit that a suitable representation for a higher-level policy in HRL should depend on
the capabilities of the skills available to it. If this representation is sufﬁcient to determine the abilities
and outcomes of these skills, then the high-level policy can select the skill most likely to perform
the desired task. This concept is closely tied to the notion of affordances, which has long been
studied in cognitive science and psychology as an action-centric representation of state (Gibson,"

& Grauman, 2021). Given a set of skills that span the possible interactions in an environment, we
propose that the value functions corresponding to these policies can provide a representation that
suitably captures the capabilities of the skills in the current state and thus can be used to form a
compact embedding space for high-level planning. We call this the Value Function Space (VFS).
Note that we intend to use these skills as high-level actions without modiﬁcations—the important
problems of skill discovery and test-time adaptation are beyond the scope of this paper."
INTRODUCTION,0.0429042904290429,"Figure 1a illustrates the state abstraction constructed by VFS for the desk rearrangement example
discussed above: VFS captures the affordances of the skills and represents the state of the envi-
ronment, along with preconditions for the low-level skills, forming a functional representation to
plan over. Since VFS constructs a skill-centric representation of states using the value functions
of the low-level skills, it captures functional equivalence of states in terms of their affordances: in
Figure 1b, states with varying object or arm positions, background textures, and distractor objects
are functionally equivalent for planning, and map to the same VFS embedding. This simpliﬁes the
high-level planning problem, allowing the higher level policy to generalize to novel environments."
INTRODUCTION,0.0462046204620462,"Statement of Contributions. The primary contribution of this work is VFS, a novel state representa-
tion derived from the value functions of low-level skills available to the agent. We show that VFS
leverages the properties of value functions, notably their ability to model possible skills and com-
pleted skills, to form an effective representation for high-level planning, and is compatible with both
model-free and model-based high-level policies. Empirical evaluations in maze-solving and robotic
manipulation demonstrate that the skill-centric representation constructed by VFS outperforms rep-
resentations learned using contrastive and information-theoretic objectives in long-horizon tasks.
We also show that VFS can generalize to novel environments in a zero-shot manner."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.052805280528052806,"Hierarchical RL has been studied extensively in the literature, commonly interpreted as a temporal
abstraction of the original MDP. Early works have interpreted the hierarchy introduced in this setting
as an abstraction of state and action spaces (Sutton et al., 1999; Dietterich, 2000; Thomas & Barto,
2012). The popular options framework Sutton et al. (1999); Precup (2000) provides a natural way of
incorporating temporally extended actions into RL systems. An agent that possesses the transition
model and reward model for such a SMDP (known as an option model) is capable of sample-based
planning in discrete (Kocsis & Szepesv´ari, 2006) and continuous state spaces (Konidaris et al., 2014;
Gopalan et al., 2017). However, doing so in environments with high-dimensional observations (such
as images) is challenging. In this work, we explore the efﬁcacy of learned skills operating on high-
dimensional observations for long-horizon control in realistic environments."

RELATED WORK,0.0594059405940594,"To improve the quality of lower-level policies, recent work in HRL has studied various facets of
the problem, including discovery of skills (Konidaris & Barto, 2009; Zhang et al., 2021b; Florensa
et al., 2017; Warde-Farley et al., 2018), end-to-end training of both levels (Kulkarni et al., 2016;
Tessler et al., 2017) and integrating goal-conditioned behaviors (Ghosh et al., 2019; Nachum et al.,
2019). In this work, we assume that the low-level skills are given, and do not focus on discovering
them. Instead, we focus on how skills can simplify the higher-level control problem by providing a
representation that is suitable for either model-based or model-free control."
RELATED WORK,0.0627062706270627,"The problem of learning meaningful long-horizon behavior by combining a set of lower-level skills,
or options, has been studied extensively in prior work. Popular approaches to composing skills
involve combining them in the space of value functions (Todorov, 2009; Hunt et al., 2019; da Silva
et al., 2009; Ziebart, 2010; Haarnoja et al., 2018), and more recently, using pseudo-rewards (Barreto
et al., 2019). While these methods have been very effective at composing low-level skills, they do not
address the question of learning a meaningful state abstraction using these skills. We take inspiration
from these works and use the value function space to construct a skill-centric state abstraction, along
with a high-level policy that composes these skills for temporally extended tasks."
RELATED WORK,0.066006600660066,"Our method can hence be interpreted as a representation learning approach. Representation learning
techniques have been employed extensively in model-free RL by augmenting auxiliary tasks based
on reconstruction losses (Lange et al., 2012; Higgins et al., 2017; Yarats et al., 2019) and predicting
the future conditioned on past observations (Schmidhuber, 1990; Jaderberg et al., 2017; van den
Oord et al., 2018; Shelhamer et al., 2016). Contrastive learning has also been used in recent works
to discover a meaningful latent space and extract reward signals for RL (Sermanet et al., 2017;
Warde-Farley et al., 2018; Dwibedi et al., 2018; Laskin et al., 2020). Another popular approach to
learning useful representation is to optimize for effective transfer of the lower-level skills and the
learned state abstraction (Gupta et al., 2017; Konidaris & Barto; Goyal et al., 2019). Unlike these
prior works, our aim is speciﬁcally to learn a representation that is grounded in the capabilities of the
low-level skills, which gives us a skill-centric abstraction of high-dimensional observations. While
we do not explicitly optimize for transfer like Gupta et al. (2017), our experiments show that VFS
can generalize to novel environments while being robust to functionally-irrelevant distractors."
RELATED WORK,0.06930693069306931,"Alongside developments in model-free RL, prior work has also sought to learn predictive models
of the environment for sampling and planning. This has been demonstrated by learning dynamics
using future predictions (Watter et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2017; Ebert et al., 2017; Banijamali et al.,
2018; Ha & Schmidhuber; Hafner et al., 2018; Ichter & Pavone, 2019; Hafner et al., 2020; Zhang

state similarity using the bisimulation metric (Castro, 2020; Zhang et al., 2021a; Agarwal et al.,
2021). The combination of learned model-free policies with structures like graphs (Savinov et al.,
2018; Eysenbach et al., 2019) and trees (Ichter et al., 2021) to plan over extended horizons has also
been demonstrated to improve generalization and exploration. While our primary objective is not
to develop better model-based RL algorithms, we show that our proposed state abstraction can be
utilized by model-based controllers to plan over temporally extended skills."

PRELIMINARIES,0.07590759075907591,"We assume that an agent has access to a ﬁnite set of temporally extended options O, or skills, which
it can sequence to solve long-horizon tasks. These skills can be trained for a wide range of tasks by
using manual reward speciﬁcation (Huber & Grupen, 1998; Stulp & Schaal, 2011), using relabeling
techniques (Andrychowicz et al., 2017), or via unsupervised skill discovery (Daniel et al., 2016; Fox
et al., 2017; Warde-Farley et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2020). Since many prior works have focused
on skill discovery, we do not explicitly address how these skills are produced."
PRELIMINARIES,0.07920792079207921,"We assume that each skill has a maximum rollout length of ⌧time steps, after which it is terminated.
We also assume that each skill oi 2 O is accompanied by a critic, or value function, Voi denoting the
expected cumulative skill reward executing skill oi from current state st. This is generally available
for policies trained with RL (Huber & Grupen, 1998; Andrychowicz et al., 2017; Kalashnikov et al.,
2021) or learned via options discovery (Bacon et al., 2017; Klissarov et al., 2017; Tiwari & Thomas,

regression to empirical returns or temporal difference learning (Dann et al., 2014)."
PRELIMINARIES,0.0891089108910891,"Our setting is closely related to the options framework of Sutton et al. (1999). Options are skills that
consist of three components: a policy ⇡: S ⇥A ! [0, 1], a termination condition β : S+ ! [0, 1],
and an initiation set I ✓S, where S, A are the low-level state and action spaces in a fully observable
decision process. An option hI, ⇡, βi is available at state st if and only if st 2 I. We do not assume
we have an initiation set, and show that the value functions provide this information. We assume
that the policies come with a termination condition, or alternatively, have a ﬁxed horizon ⌧. Next,
we describe a framework to formulate a decision problem that uses these options for planning."
PRELIMINARIES,0.0924092409240924,"We assume that the low-level observation and action space of the agent can be described as a fully
observable semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) M described by a tuple (S, O, R, P, ⌧, γ), where
S ✓Rn is the n-dimensional continuous state space; O is a ﬁnite set of temporally extended skills,
or options, with a maximum horizon of ⌧time steps; R(s0|s, oi) is the task reward received after
executing the skill oi 2 O at state s 2 S; P(s0|s, oi) is a PDF describing the probability of arriving
in state s0 2 S after executing skill oi 2 O at state s 2 S; γ 2 (0, 1] is the discount factor. Given a

observation-action pairs may be required to describe the state. Explicitly addressing partial observ-

SKILL VALUE FUNCTIONS AS STATE SPACES,0.10231023102310231,"The notion of value in RL is closely related to affordances, in that the value function predicts the ca-
pabilities of the skill being learned. The supervised learning problem of affordance prediction (Ugur
et al., 2009) can in fact be cast as a special case of value prediction (Sutton & Barto, 2018; Graves
et al., 2020). In this section, we construct a skill-centric representation of state derived from skill
value functions that captures the affordances of the low-level skills, and empirically show that this
representation is effective for high-level planning."
SKILL VALUE FUNCTIONS AS STATE SPACES,0.10561056105610561,"Given an SMDP M(S, O, R, P, ⌧, γ) with a ﬁnite set of k skills oi 2 O trained with sparse out-
come rewards and their corresponding value functions Voi, we construct an embedding space Z by
stacking these skill value functions. This gives us an abstract representation that maps a state st
to a k-dimensional representation Z(st) := [Vo1(st), Vo2(st), ..., Vok(st)], which we call the Value
Function Space, or VFS for short. This representation captures functional information about the
exhaustive set of interactions that the agent can have with the environment by means of executing
the skills, and is thus a suitable state abstraction for downstream tasks."
SKILL VALUE FUNCTIONS AS STATE SPACES,0.10891089108910891,"Figure 1(a) illustrates the proposed state abstraction for a conceptual desk rearrangement task with
eight low-level skills. A raw observation, such as an image of the robotic arm and desk, is abstracted
by a 8-dimensional tuple of skill value functions. This representation captures positional information
about the scene (e.g., both blocks are on the counter and drawer is closed since the corresponding
values are 1 at t0), preconditions for interactions (e.g., both blocks can be lifted since the “Pick”
values are high at t0), and the effects of executing a feasible skill (e.g., the value corresponding to
the “Open Drawer” skill increases on executing it at t1), making it suitable for high-level planning."
SKILL VALUE FUNCTIONS AS STATE SPACES,0.11221122112211221,"We hypothesize that since VFS learns a skill-centric representation of the scene, it is robust to
exogenous factors of variation, such as background distractors and appearance of task-irrelevant
components of the scene. This also enables VFS to generalize to novel environments with the same
set of low-level skill, which we demonstrate empirically. Figure 1(b) illustrates this for the desk
rearrangement task. All conﬁgurations shown are functionally equivalent and can be interacted with
identically. Intuitively, VFS would map these conﬁgurations to the same abstract state by ignoring
factors like arm pose, color of the desk, or additional objects, which do not affect the low-level skills."

from an overestimation bias, due to the maximization step above, and harms learning. Hasselt et al.

this variant, called DDQN, for subsequent evaluations in this work. Note that we are using the skills

EVALUATING LONG-HORIZON PERFORMANCE IN MAZE-SOLVING,0.14521452145214522,"To evaluate the long-horizon performance of VFS against commonly used representation learning
methods, we use the versatile MiniGrid environment (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018) in a fully
observable setting, where the agent receives a top-down view of the environment. We consider
two tasks: (i) MultiRoom, where the agent is tasked with reaching the goal by solving a variable-
sized maze spanning up to 10 rooms. The agent must cross each room and open the door to ac-
cess the following rooms; (ii) KeyCorridor, where the agent is tasked with reaching a goal up to
7 rooms away and may face locked doors. The agent must ﬁnd the key corresponding to a color-
coded door and open it to access subsequent rooms. Both these tasks have a sparse reward that
is only provided for successfully reaching the goal. This presents a challenging domain for long-
horizon sequential reasoning, where tasks may require over 200 time steps to succeed, making a
great testbed for evaluating the ability of the state abstractions to capture relevant information for
sequencing multiple skills. The agents have access to the following temporally extended skills—
GoToObject, PickupObject, DropObject and UnlockDoor—where the ﬁrst three skills
are text-conditioned and Object may refer to a door, key, box or circle of any color. Since Min-
iGrid is easily reconﬁgurable, we also generate a set of holdout MultiRoom mazes with different
grid layouts to evaluate the zero-shot generalization performance of the policies trained with these

to 29% in the largest environment. The ofﬂine baselines (AE and CPC) construct a compact state
abstraction, which makes the learning problem easier for DDQN, and show signiﬁcant improve-
ments in smaller environments (MultiRoom-2,4 and KeyCorridor-3). However, they are unable to
improve the performance in larger environments. We hypothesize that this is due to the inability of
the representations to capture information necessary for the high-level policy, since they are learned
independent of the controller. The performance of representations learned online (VAE and CURL),
which are implemented analogous to their ofﬂine counterparts (AE and CPC, respectively) support
this hypothesis and improves the performance across all tasks by learning representations jointly
with the controller, and scoring up to 54% in the most challenging environment. We hypothesize
that the limited performance of these methods is due to the lack of direct inﬂuence of the downstream
task on the representation. Despite being constructed ofﬂine, VFS explicitly captures the capabilities
of the low-level skills and provides an action-centric representation for the high-level policy, greatly
simplifying the control problem. This is reﬂected in the performance of VFS across all tasks—it
outperforms all baselines, scoring 98% on the simplest task and up to 68% on the most challenging
task, beating the next best method by over 25%. Figure 2 shows sample rollouts of the high-level
policy using VFS as the state representation in the two tasks discussed. It is important to note that
while VFS outperforms the baselines in these tasks, our method is largely orthogonal to these repre-
sentation learning algorithms and can be combined constructively to improve task performance—we
show this, along with further ablations in Appendix B."

ZERO-SHOT GENERALIZATION,0.2145214521452145,"We evaluate the generalization abilities of these representations by training them for the KeyCorridor
task (as above) and evaluating on MultiRoom. Since the skills available in MultiRoom are a subset of
those in KeyCorridor, we ignore any invalid actions executed by the agent. Note that the high-level

ZERO-SHOT GENERALIZATION,0.21782178217821782,"Table 2 shows the success rates of the representations in the MultiRoom tasks with 4 (MR4) and 10
rooms (MR10). Unsurprisingly, HRL with raw observations fails to generalize, because the maze
layout differs signiﬁcantly (e.g. see Figure 3). AE and CPC learn a compact representation from
high-dimensional observations and allow the high-level policy to generalize to simpler tasks like
MR4 and achieve up to 47% success rate. Interestingly, their online counterparts (VAE and CURL)
also fail to generalize and perform poorly, likely because representations learned jointly with the
RL policy can overﬁt to the source environment. VFS learns a skill-centric representation that can
generalize zero-shot to tasks that use the same skills, and thus outperforms the next best baseline by
up to 180%, closely matching the performance of an HRL policy trained from scratch in the target
environment with online interaction (HRL-Target)."

APPLICATION: ROBOTIC MANIPULATION"
A SIMPLE ALGORITHM FOR MODEL-BASED RL,0.30033003300330036,"We evaluate the performance of VFS-MB in a complex image-based task using a simulated ma-
nipulation environment with an 8-DoF robotic arm, similar to the setup used by Jang et al. (2021).
The robot only has access to high-dimensional egocentric visual observations. We consider the
task of semantic rearrangement, which requires rearranging objects into semantically meaningful
positions—e.g., grouped into (multiple) clusters, or moved to a corner (Figure 5). Efﬁciently solv-
ing this task requires the robot to plan over a series of manipulation maneuvers, interacting with up
to 10 distinct objects. This requires long-horizon planning, and presents a major challenge for RL
methods. Each of the methods we compare have access to a library of MoveANearB skills, trained
as a multi-task policy with MT-Opt (Kalashnikov et al., 2021). There are 10 objects, and 9 possible
destinations near which they can be moved, resulting in a total of 90 skills, which then comprise the
action space for planning. The skills control the robot at a frequency of 0.5 Hz, taking an average of
14 time steps to execute with a success rate of 94%. We provide further details about these skills in
Appendix A.2."
A SIMPLE ALGORITHM FOR MODEL-BASED RL,0.30363036303630364,"We consider two versions of the task, which arrange either 5 or 10 objects to semantic positions. The
O5 environment uses a random subset of the 10 objects in every experiment; lesser objects allow
a smaller planning horizon, making planning problem simpler than in the O10 environment, which
has all 10 objects. We randomize the object positions on the table and command the algorithms to
reach the same goal with a planning horizon H = 7 steps for the smaller environment and H = 15
steps for the larger environment, reporting the task success rate averaged over 20 experimental runs."
A SIMPLE ALGORITHM FOR MODEL-BASED RL,0.3069306930693069,"Baselines:
To evaluate the efﬁcacy of the proposed representation for high-level model-based
planning, we compare it against four alternative representations used in conjunction with the algo-
rithm described in Section 6.1. All methods have access to the skills and use them as the low-level
action space. Raw Image learns a policy on raw visual observations from the robot’s onboard cam-
era. VAE uses a variational autoencoder to project the observations to a 100−dimensional learned
embedding space, similar to Corneil et al. (2018). We train this VAE ofﬂine from trajectories col-
lected by rolling out the models. CPC uses contrastive predictive coding (van den Oord et al., 2018)
to learn a similar representation from ofﬂine trajectories. We also compare against an Oracle State
baseline that has access to privileged information—the simulator state—and learns the model on
this. This gives us an upper bound for the performance of the baselines."

how such skills are learned. Improving the low-level skills jointly with the high-level policy could
lead to even better performance on particularly complex tasks, and would be an exciting direction
for future work. More broadly, since our method connects skills directly to state representations, it
could be used to turn unsupervised skill discovery methods directly into unsupervised representation
learning methods, which could be an exciting path toward more general approaches that retain the
invariances and generalization beneﬁts of our method."
