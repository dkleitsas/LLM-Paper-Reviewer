ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0026246719160104987,"Generalising robustly to distribution shift is a major challenge that is pervasive
across most real-world applications of machine learning. A recent study highlighted
that many advanced algorithms proposed to tackle such domain generalisation (DG)
fail to outperform a properly tuned empirical risk minimisation (ERM) baseline.
We take a different approach, and explore the impact of the ERM loss function on
out-of-domain generalisation. In particular, we introduce a novel meta-learning
approach to loss function search based on implicit gradient. This enables us
to discover a general purpose parametric loss function that provides a drop-in
replacement for cross-entropy. Our loss can be used in standard training pipelines
to efﬁciently train robust models using any neural architecture on new datasets.
The results show that it clearly surpasses cross-entropy, enables simple ERM to
outperform some more complicated prior DG methods, and provides state-of-the-art
performance across a variety of DG benchmarks. Furthermore, unlike most existing
DG approaches, our setup applies to the most practical setting of single-source
domain generalisation, on which we show signiﬁcant improvement."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.007874015748031496,"Deep learning is highly successful when the training and testing samples meet the i.i.d. assumption.
However, this assumption is violated in many practical applications of machine learning from medical
imaging to earth observation imaging (Koh et al., 2021). This has led a large number of studies to
investigate approaches to training models with increased robustness to distribution shift at testing-
time, a problem setting known as Domain Generalisation (DG). Despite the volume of research
in this area (Zhou et al., 2021a), a recent careful benchmarking exercise, DomainBed (Gulrajani
& Lopez-Paz, 2021) showed that simple empirical risk minimisation (ERM) on a combination of
training domains is a very strong baseline when properly tuned. State-of-the-art alternatives based
on sophisticated architectures, regularisers, and data augmentation schemes failed to reliably beat
ERM (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.010498687664041995,"Rather than propose an alternative to ERM for DG, we investigate a previously unstudied hyper-
parameter of ERM, namely the choice of loss function—which has been ubiquitously taken to be
standard cross-entropy (CE) in prior DG work. Loss function choice has been shown to impact
calibration (Mukhoti et al., 2020), overﬁtting (Gonzalez & Miikkulainen, 2019), and label-noise
robustness (Wang et al., 2019) in standard supervised learning, so it is intuitive that it would impact
robustness to domain-shift. However, it has not yet been studied in this context. Our preliminary
experiments showed that equipping ERM with some recent robust loss functions in place of CE does
lead to improvements in DG performance where sophisticated alternatives have failed (Gulrajani &
Lopez-Paz, 2021). This raises the question: can one design a loss function specialised for DG?"
INTRODUCTION,0.013123359580052493,"To answer this question, we deﬁne a meta-learning algorithm to learn a parametric (white-box) loss
function suitable for DG. Our desiderata are: (1) Performing ERM with this loss on a source domain
should lead to good performance when tested on out-of-domain target data; and (2) It should provide
a ‘plug-and-play’ drop-in replacement for cross-entropy that, once learned, can be used without
further modiﬁcation or computational expense with any new dataset or model architecture. While
there has been growing interest in meta-learning for loss function design (Li et al., 2019a), they
mostly fail to meet these criteria. They learn problem-speciﬁc—rather than re-usable—losses. If
applied to DG, this would imply replacing simple ERM learning with sophisticated meta-learning"

replacement for CE that leads standard training pipelines to produce more robust models."
INTRODUCTION,0.02099737532808399,"To train a general purpose robust loss function we need a search space that is ﬂexible enough to
include interesting new losses, but simple enough to generalise across tasks without overﬁtting to the
problem used for loss learning. We choose a 12-dimensional space of fourth order Taylor polynomials.
Furthermore, we need a loss that is suitable for all stages of training. This precludes the majority
of approaches based on online meta-learning which update the loss and base model iteratively (Li
et al., 2019a;c), and also suffer from short-horizon bias (Wu et al., 2018). Evolutionary methods
(Gonzalez & Miikkulainen, 2019) and reinforcement-learning (Li et al., 2019a) could support loss
learning in principle, but are too slow to be feasible. Therefore we develop the ﬁrst implicit-gradient
based approach to loss learning. This allows us to tractably compute meta-gradients of the target
recognition performance with respect to the loss used for training in the source domain."
INTRODUCTION,0.023622047244094488,"We use a simple DG task (RotatedMNIST) to train our robust loss, termed Implicit Taylor Loss (ITL),
to replace CE in ERM. Subsequent experiments show that ERM with ITL surpasses CE across a range
of DG benchmarks, and leads to state of the art performance, despite being much simpler and faster
than competitor DG methods. While the majority of existing DG methods require multiple source
domains to conduct data augmentation or feature alignment strategies, ITL improves single-source
domain generalisation, a crucial problem setting which has been minimally studied thus far."
INTRODUCTION,0.026246719160104987,"To summarise our contributions: (i) We provide the ﬁrst study on the signiﬁcance of supervised
loss function choice in DG (ii) We demonstrate the ﬁrst efﬁcient solution to loss-learning based on
meta-gradients computed by the Implicit Function Theorem. (iii) Empirically, we show that our
learned ITL loss enhances simple ERM and achieves state of the art DG performance across a range
of benchmarks, including the challenging single-source DG scenario."

source domains, but with the further requirement that it is robust to testing on novel target domain
data—without accessing target data during training. DG is now a well studied (Zhou et al., 2021a) area
with diverse approaches including data augmentation (Shankar et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2021b), robust
training algorithms such as domain alignment objectives (Li et al., 2018b), and other regularisers
(Li et al., 2019c; Balaji et al., 2018). Most DG studies have assumed the multi-source setting, which
enables new data-augmentation strategies (Zhou et al., 2021b), and allows generalisation-promoting
design features to be tuned by domain-wise cross-validation. In particular, a few studies (Li et al.,
2019c; Balaji et al., 2018) have considered meta-learning based DG, where a regulariser applied in a
training domain is tuned by meta-gradients from the resulting validation-domain performance. The
resulting model is then deployed to the true target domain within the same family. These methods
require regulariser meta-learning for each given multi-source DG problem family. In contrast, we
propose to learn a simple loss function once, which then provides a drop-in replacement for CE in
any single-, or multi-source DG problem. A recent criticism of the DG literature showed that no
method consistently outperformed a well tuned ERM baseline on the carefully designed DomainBed
benchmark (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021). Rather than competing with ERM, we simply enhance
the ERM loss function and this leads to a clear improvement on DomainBed."

META-LEARNING LOSSES FOR DG,0.06299212598425197,"Our goal is to replace the standard CE loss typically used in ERM with a learned loss function. We
are motivated by recent work showing that learned losses can enable models to perform better for a
variety of other problem settings, such as training with label noise (Wang et al., 2019) and improving
calibration (Mukhoti et al., 2020). We formulate the task of learning the parameters, ω, of a loss
function, Lω, as a bilevel optimisation problem. The outer objective is to ﬁnd the ω that maximises
the performance of a model evaluated on the target domain data, and the inner problem is to train
a model to minimise the value of Lω measured on the source domain data. The loss parameters
are optimised using gradient-based methods that take advantage of the implicit function theorem to
efﬁciently compute gradients for the outer optimisation problem. Crucially, once the optimal loss
function ω∗has been found, new DG problems can be solved via ERM on the Lω∗loss."

EXPERIMENTS,0.27034120734908135,"fary et al., 2015), which contains six different domains that are all derived from MNIST (LeCun
& Cortes, 2010) but with different rotations: 0%, 15%, 30%, 45%, 60%, and 75%. The leave-
one-domain-out strategy for robust implicit gradient estimation, therefore, results in six inner loop
instantiations for each outer loop iteration. For efﬁciency, we use 2-layer MLPs as the base model,
which contains 1024-256-10 units from the input layer to the output one with ReLU as the activation
function. The learning rates in the inner loop and outer loop are both 0.01, a batch size of 32 is used
for the inner loop, and the Neumann series used for approximating the inverse Hessian is truncated at
15 iterations. The result is a set of 12 parameters that deﬁne the learned fourth-order polynomial loss
function and an example of learned loss is shown in Appendix A.3. The meta-train compute cost is
descripted in Appendix A.6."

A pre-trained ResNet18 backbone is used throughout, together with the source and

and perform model selection using the validation set. We use same set of hyperparameters (learning
rate of 0.001, weight decay of 0.00001, and batch size of 32 for each domain) for the baseline ERM

We ﬁrst conduct experiments using the classic PACS protocol to facilitate com-
parison against many recent competitors that were not evaluated on DomainBed. Table 1 compares
our ITL-Net performance vs state-of-the-art methods. From the results we can see that: (i) Simply
swapping out the loss in ERM from CE to ITL, leads to a signiﬁcant 5.5% improvement. (ii) Overall
our ITL-Net leads to state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing the most recent and

RESULTS,0.3123359580052493,"DomainBed: Results
The results in Table 2 compare ITL-Net with ERM and some of the most
competitive published alternatives: SagNet (Nam et al., 2019), CORAL (Sun & Saenko, 2016),
CDANN (Li et al., 2018c) and RSC (Huang et al., 2020) in the original DomainBed paper (Gulrajani &
Lopez-Paz, 2021). A detailed comparison is given in Appendix 6. The conclusion of the DomainBed
study was that existing methods did not reliably beat ERM under this hyperparameter tuning protocol.
In contrast, we can see that ITL-Net provides a clear improvement on ERM and matches or improves
on the strongest existing competitor in each case, especially on TerraIncognita and OfﬁceHome. To
formally compare ITL-Net with competitors, we perform signiﬁcance testing using the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test, where the p-value is set as 0.025 and the sample size is number of the Domain
datasets applied. For example, when comparing the performance of ITL-Net and ERM, the null
hypothesis (H0) is that ITL-Net has equal performance to ERM on DomainBed and the alternative
hypothesis (H1) that ITL-Net is statistically signiﬁcantly better than ERM on DomainBed.
The
results of the hypothesis tests comparing ITL to each competitor are summarized at the bottom of
Table 2, and conﬁrm that ITL-Net outperforms them all."
RESULTS,0.31496062992125984,"Single Source DG: Setup
Most existing DG methods rely on the availability of multiple source
domains in some form: For example to synthesise new domains for data augmentation (Zhou et al.,
2021b), or perform feature alignment among training domains (Sun & Saenko, 2016). A unique
feature of our ITL-Net is that, since it is only a small modiﬁcation to ERM, it can be used to learn on
a single source domain. Although this setting is not well explored in the literature, it is obviously
highly practical as multiple source domains are often not available in practice. To explore this setting,
we modify the DomainBed benchmark to train on a single source at a time and average over each
source→target combination, rather than training on the conjunction of all sources."
RESULTS,0.31758530183727035,"Single Source DG: Results
From the results in Table 4, we can see that performance drops across
the board compared to multi-source training (Table 2), as expected. However, the state of the art
alternatives CORAL and SagNet are no longer as competitive compared to ERM as they were in
the multi-source case (Table 2)—this is expected as they are designed to exploit cues from multiple
source domains. In contrast, our ITL-Net maintains a clear lead over the conventional ERM with
cross entropy baseline in this setting. This is a signiﬁcant achievement as existing work has not
produced algorithms that improve robustness under the single-source setting."

FURTHER ANALYSIS"
FURTHER ANALYSIS,0.3648293963254593,"Qualitative comparison and impact on learning
To understand our learned loss, we visually
compare it Figure 5 with several other loss functions: CE, SCE (Wang et al., 2019), Label Smoothing
(LS) (Pereyra et al., 2017), and FOCAL (Mukhoti et al., 2020). Compared to the standard cross entropy
loss, we can see that ITL has softer penalties for severe misclassiﬁcation, and stronger penalties for
moderate misclassiﬁcation. In addition, it can be noticed that FOCAL has the most similar shape
to our ITL. The properties of the FOCAL loss for probability calibration were recently studied in
(Mukhoti et al., 2020). Motivated by this, we report the evolution of the target-domain entropy
of correctly and incorrectly classiﬁed samples during training in Figure 2(left) and Figure 2(right)
respectively. Clearly, a byproduct of ITL compared to CE and SCE is a (desirable) increase in
uncertainty for misclassiﬁed instances. FOCAL has similar behaviour to ITL in general, especially
the entropy of prediction distributions for misclassiﬁed instances."
FURTHER ANALYSIS,0.3674540682414698,"Quantitative comparison to other robust losses
We next investigate whether the good perfor-
mance of ITL in cross-domain robustness can be easily replicated by applying existing robust loss
functions, or whether our meta-learning pipeline has learned something new in terms of robust model
training. SCE (Wang et al., 2019) and GCE (Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018) were designed with label-noise
robustness in mind, while Focal (Mukhoti et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2017) was designed for class
imbalance and calibration. Label-smooth (LS) (Pereyra et al., 2017) is for improving generalisation
and reducing overconﬁdence. From the results in Table 3, we can see that while some losses improve
on CE, ITL leads to the clearest improvement. The somewhat similar behaviour of ITL and FOCAL
in terms of induced entropy from Figure 2 does not carry over similar cross-domain recognition
accuracy. Note that all experiments in Table 3 were run by us, while competitor performance in
Table 2 is taken from (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021)."
FURTHER ANALYSIS,0.3700787401574803,"Loss landscape analysis and Perturbation analysis
One of the factors that affect model general-
isation is the loss landscape at convergence. (Keskar et al., 2017; Chaudhari et al., 2019) observed
that ﬂatter loss landscapes lead to good generalisation of the learned model. To this end, we compared
a 1D slice through the loss landscape of ITL-Net with that of ERM on both source domain and target
domains. Namely, we perturb the converged paraeters by moving it around though gradient direction
which generated by the evigenvector of the Hessian matrix . From Figure 4, we can see that for each
held out target domain, ITL-Nets have ﬂatter loss landscapes compared with models trained by CE
with respect to the source domains. To further analyse the quality of the minimas provided by CE"

FURTHER ANALYSIS,0.5039370078740157,"Repeatability analysis
Our message thus far is that a single loss produced by our pipeline can be
re-used as a plug-and-play modiﬁcation to improve vanilla ERM+CE on a wide variety of held-out
downstream DG tasks. That said, one might reasonably wonder about the reliability of the loss
function learning procedure itself. To investigate this, we repeat our entire pipeline including the
meta-train stage ﬁve times. We then evaluate the consistency of the resulting ﬁve loss functions on
the downstream ColoredMNIST task. Furthermore, to evaluate the dependence of our result on the
choice of meta-training dataset, we repeat the above experiment on RotatedKMNIST (Clanuwat et al.,
2018) to replace the RotatedMNIST used previously. From the results in Table 5, we can see that
performance is quite consistent over trials (small standard deviation). It also differs little with choice
of pre-training dataset - with both options performing well compared to competitors in Table 2."
FURTHER ANALYSIS,0.5065616797900262,"Limitations
ITL improves ERM+CE for DG tasks in general, but in some cases, the margin over
SOTA is small, since other state-of-the-art competitors may beat ERM+CE. It would be more inter-
esting if ITL is highly complementary to SOTA methods based on other architectural, augmentation,
or domain-alignment improvements – but this remains for future work to determine."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5118110236220472,"We provided the ﬁrst study of the effect of ERM loss functions on Domain Generalisation. We
observe that models trained by ERM with existing robust loss functions can improve performance on
Domain Generalisation compared with those trained by Cross-Entropy. To discover the best loss for
DG, we perform meta-learning to ﬁnd a re-usable white-box loss function. This is tractably solved
using IFT to obtain gradients of the target domain performance with respect to the source domain
loss parameters. This also provides the ﬁrst demonstration of IFT-based loss learning in the literature.
The results show that a simple modiﬁcation to the standard ERM pipeline improves both multi-source
and single source DG, and even surpasses the purpose-designed state of the art models."

methods require about 12 GPU-days (Liu et al., 2021)."
