ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0021413276231263384,"Aiming to find a program satisfying the user intent given input-output examples,
program synthesis has attracted increasing interest in the area of machine learning.
Despite the promising performance of existing methods, most of their success
comes from the privileged information of well-designed input-output examples.
However, providing such input-output examples is unrealistic because it requires
the users to have the ability to describe the underlying program with a few input-
output examples under the training distribution. In this work, we propose a query-
based framework that trains a query neural network to generate informative input-
output examples automatically and interactively from a large query space. The
quality of the query depends on the amount of the mutual information between
the query and the corresponding program, which can guide the optimization of
the query framework. To estimate the mutual information more accurately, we
introduce the functional space (F-space) which models the relevance between the
input-output examples and the programs in a differentiable way. We evaluate the
effectiveness and generalization of the proposed query-based framework on the
Karel task and the list processing task. Experimental results show that the query-
based framework can generate informative input-output examples which achieve
and even outperform well-designed input-output examples."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.006423982869379015,"Program synthesis is the task of automatically finding a program that satisfies the user intent ex-
pressed in the form of some specifications like input-output examples (Gulwani et al., 2017). Re-
cently, there has been an increasing interest in tackling it using neural networks in various domains,
including string manipulation (Gulwani, 2011; Gulwani et al., 2012; Devlin et al., 2017b), list pro-
cessing (Balog et al., 2017; Zohar & Wolf, 2018) and graphic applications (Ellis et al., 2018; 2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.008565310492505354,"Despite their promising performance, most of their success relies on the well-designed input-output
examples, without which the performance of the program synthesis model drops heavily. For exam-
ple, in Karel (Devlin et al., 2017b; Bunel et al., 2018), the given input-output examples are required
to have a high branch coverage ratio on the test program; In list processing, the given input-output
examples are guided by constraint propagation (Balog et al., 2017) to ensure their effectiveness on
the test program. However, providing such input-output examples is unrealistic because it requires
the users to be experienced in programming to describe the underlying program with several input-
output examples. Worse, the users must be familiar with the distribution of the training dataset to
prevent themselves from providing out-of-distribution examples (Shin et al., 2019). In summary,
how to generate informative input-output examples without expert experience is still an important
problem that remains a challenge."
INTRODUCTION,0.010706638115631691,"In this paper, we propose a query-based framework to automatically and efficiently generate infor-
mative input-output examples from a large space, which means that the underlying program can be
easily distinguished with these examples. This framework consists of two parts: the query network"

INTRODUCTION,0.027837259100642397,"Figure 1: The query-based framework. The query network generates informative input-output exam-
ples by interacting with the user, and then the generated examples are sent to the synthesis network
to synthesize the underlying program."
INTRODUCTION,0.029978586723768737,"and the synthesis network, and each part is trained separately. The query network is trained to gen-
erate the input-output examples in an iterative manner, and then the synthesis network is trained to
synthesize the program with the input-output examples generated by the query network. It has three
advantages: (1) There is no demand for well-designed input-output examples in both training and
testing, which leads to a good generalization. (2) The query network works in an efficiently gener-
ative manner, which can essentially reduce the computation cost while facing problems with large
input-output space. (3) The query network serves as a plug-and-play module with high scalability,
for it is separated from the program synthesis process entirely."
INTRODUCTION,0.032119914346895075,"To train the query network, the key idea is to model the query process as a decision tree and find
out that the informativeness of the input-output examples is associated with the amount of mutual
information (i.e.the information gain in the decision tree) between the input-output examples and
the programs, and thus the query network can be optimized by maximizing the mutual informa-
tion. The mutual information can be approximated by the InfoNCE loss (van den Oord et al., 2018),
which depends on the relevance between the samples. However, due to the many-to-many relation-
ship between the input-output examples and the programs, the relevance is difficult to be measured
straightforwardly. To this end, we introduce the functional space (F-space). In F-space, each pro-
gram can be projected into a vector, and each input-output example corresponds to a set of candidate
programs, which can be represented by a normal distribution (Sun & Nielsen, 2019). Whenever a
new example is queried, the new set of candidate programs is produced by the intersection of the
two original sets of programs, and the new distribution is produced by the product of the two origi-
nal distributions. The more the queried examples, the smaller the size of the program set, the lower
the entropy of the distribution. With the InfoNCE loss and F-space, the query network is trained
to generate the input-output examples whose F-space distribution can maximize the probability of
the corresponding program and minimize the probability of the others. Once the query network is
trained, the training of the synthesis network is no different from what other researchers have done
before, except that the input-output examples are generated by the query network."
INTRODUCTION,0.034261241970021415,"We evaluate our method on the Karel task and the list processing task which have large input spaces.
Without utilizing the well-designed input-output examples both in training and testing, we achieve
and even outperform the state-of-the-art performance on the Karel task and list processing task,
which shows the effectiveness and generalization of our query-based framework."

PROBLEM STATEMENT"
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.03854389721627409,"Intuitively, consider an oracle that contains some kind of symbolic rules (e.g.programs), our goal
is to discover these symbolic rules inside this oracle. To do this, the traditional program synthesis
assumes that the oracle can provide some informative signals (e.g.input-output examples) automat-
ically, based on which the synthesizer can find the rules. However, this is a strong assumption with
high requirements on the oracle that is impractical in many cases. In this work, we consider a query
problem where the informative signals are gained actively by querying the oracle under a much
weaker assumption that the behavior of the oracle is deterministic (i.e.the same input always results
in the same output)."
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.04068522483940043,"Following the intuition, a reasonable solution for the query problem would be ”making the programs
distinguishable with as few queries as possible”. To make this statement concrete and practical, we
introduce the following formulations."
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.042826552462526764,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.044967880085653104,"First, we define the functional equivalence, which is consistent with the definition of the equivalence
of functions in mathematics.
Definition 2.1 (Functional equivalence). Let I be the input example domain containing all valid
input examples, O be the output example domain containing all possible output examples, and P be
the program domain containing all valid programs under the domain specific language (DSL), each
program p ∈P can be seen as a function p : I →O. For two programs pi ∈P and pj ∈P, pi and
pj are functional equivalent if and only if ∀x ∈I, pi(x) = pj(x)."
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.047109207708779445,"Using the concept of functional equivalence, we can formulate the program synthesis task:
Definition 2.2 (Program synthesis). Suppose there is an underlying program p ∈P and K input-
output examples JeK = {(xk, yk)|(xk, yk) ∈I × O, k = 1 · · · K} generated by it, the program
synthesis task aims to find a program ˆp which is functional equivalent to p using JeK."
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.04925053533190578,"Following the definitions above, we can define the task of the query.
Definition 2.3 (Query). Given a program p ∈P and a set of history K input-output examples JeK,
the query process firstly generates a query by the query network fq: xK+1 = fq(JeK) ∈I. Then, a
corresponding response is given by the program yK+1 = p(xK+1) ∈O. The query and response
are added to the history input-output examples: JeK ←JeK ∪{(xK+1, yK+1)} and this process
repeats."
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.05139186295503212,"The query process aims to distinguish the underlying program with as few queries as possible, based
on which we can define the optimal query strategy.
Definition 2.4 (The optimal query strategy). Given a set of programs P and a target program p∗,
the optimal query strategy Q aims to distinguish the p∗by generating as few input-output examples
JeK as possible."
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.05353319057815846,"When the query space is large, it is impractical to find the optimal query strategy by direct search.
Thus, we take the query process as the expansion of a decision tree where the leaves are the pro-
grams, the nodes are the queries, and the edges are the responses, and then the generation of queries
can be guided by the information gain, which is also known as the mutual information:

mizes the relevance between the negative pairs. Specifically, for a batch of data {(JeKn, pn), pn}N,
we construct positive pairs as {(JeKi, pi)} and negative pairs as {(JeKi, pj)|i ̸= j}. Traditionally,
the relevance is defined as the dot product of the samples, which may be inaccurate for the many-
to-many relationship between the input-output examples and the programs. Thus next, we will

and they are considered to be functionally equivalent. This is also consistent with Definition 2.1.

F-space and learn an approximate space with dimension reduction by neural networks."

follows:"

F-space vectors JrK = {vn}N.
• For two sets of input-output examples JeKi and JeKj, if JeKi ⊆JeKj, then their F-space
representations JrKi and JrKj have the relationship JrKi ⊇JrKj.
• For two sets of input-output examples JeKi and JeKj, suppose JeK′ = JeKi ∩JeKj, then in
F-space, their corresponding representations have the relationship JrK′ = JrKi ∪JrKj
• Similarly, if JeK′ = JeKi ∪JeKj, then in F-space, their corresponding representations have
the relationship JrK′ = JrKi ∩JrKj"
F-SPACE,0.0835117773019272,"Additionally, this representation should be differentiable and thus can be optimized by neural net-
works. To this end, we model the representation of JeK as a Normal distribution (Ren & Leskovec,
2020; Sun & Nielsen, 2019), where the probability of the distribution indicates the possibility that
it is the underlying program to be synthesized given input-output examples JeK. We illustrate the
projection, the subset relationship, and the union/intersection operation of distributions in Figure 2.
Under this representation, the query process becomes the process of reducing the uncertainty of the
distribution. To train the query network, we define several neural operators for the neural network
training as follows."

We

METRICS,0.16488222698072805,"• Semantics: Given 5 input-output examples, if the predicted program satisfies all these
examples, then it is semantically correct.
• Generalization: Given 5 input-output examples and a held-out input-output example, if
the predicted program satisfies all 6 examples, then it is generally correct.
• Exact match: If the predicted program is the same as the ground-truth program, then it
matches the ground-truth exactly."
METRICS,0.1670235546038544,"Among them, the exact match is the most strict metric and generalization is the second one. In
practice, the exact match has its drawback in that the predicted program may be different from
the ground-truth program, but they are functionally equivalent. Thus, the performance is measured
by generalization on Karel and semantics on list processing traditionally. However, generalization
is not appropriate here for two reasons: (1) It can only measure the performance of the program
synthesis process instead of the query process. In the query process, the network chooses input-
output examples independently, and judging them by the held-out example is meaningless. (2) Even
for the program synthesis process without query, generalization is not strict enough. The program
that satisfies a small set of input-output examples may fail on a larger set of input-output examples.
Thus, the best choice is to use functional equivalence as our metric. Unfortunately, the judgment
of functional equivalent is a notoriously difficult problem which makes it hard to be applied in
evaluation. To alleviate this problem, we generate 95 held-out input-output examples randomly to
achieve a higher branch coverage than 1 held-out example, and make the generalization on these
examples a proxy of the functional equivalence:"

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.284796573875803,"Programming by examples.
Synthesizing a program that satisfies the user intent using the pro-
vided input-output examples is a challenging problem that has been studied for years (Manna &
Waldinger, 1971; Lieberman, 2001; Solar-Lezama et al., 2006; Gulwani, 2011; Gulwani et al., 2012).
Recently, with the development of Deep Learning, more researchers tend to tackle this problem
with neural networks in a variety of tasks, including string transformation (Devlin et al., 2017b),
list processing (Balog et al., 2017; Zohar & Wolf, 2018), graphic generation (Ellis et al., 2018; Tian
et al., 2019), Karel (Devlin et al., 2017a; Bunel et al., 2018), policy abstraction (Sun et al., 2018;
Verma et al., 2018) and so on. Additionally, techniques like program debugger (Balog et al., 2020;
Gupta et al., 2020), traces (Chen et al., 2019; Shin et al., 2018; Ellis et al., 2019), property sig-
natures (Odena & Sutton, 2020; Odena et al., 2021) are also used to improve the performance of
program synthesis. However, their promising performance relies on the well-designed input-output
examples which is a high requirement for users. If the examples provided are of poor quality, the
performance will be affected severely. Worse, if out-of-distribution examples are provided, the pro-
gram synthesis model cannot finish the task as expected (Shin et al., 2019)."
RELATED WORK,0.28693790149892934,"Interactive program synthesis.
Considering the high requirement of input-output examples, Le
et al. (2017) build an abstract framework in which the program synthesis system can interact with
users to guide the process of synthesis. Following this framework, multiple interactive synthesis
systems are studied. Among them, Mayer et al. (2015), Wang et al. (2017), and Laich et al. (2020)
tend to find counter-examples as queries to the users in a random manner. Although they get rid
of the restrictions on the users, the quantity of the input-output examples is not guaranteed, which
may get the synthesis process into trouble. Padhi et al. (2018) select more than one query each time
and let the users choose which one to answer. This brings an additional burden on the users, and
the users are unaware of which query will improve the program synthesized most. Most recently,
Ji et al. (2020) utilizes the minimax branch to select the question where the worst answer gives the
best reduction of the program domain. Theoretically, the performance of the selection is guaranteed.
However, this method is based on search and hardly be applied to tasks with large input-output
space. Worse, the query process and the synthesis process are bound, which results in its poor
scalability. In contrast, our method can be applied to problems with large spaces, and the query
process is decoupled with the synthesis process, which makes its application more flexible."
RELATED WORK,0.2890792291220557,"Learning to acquire information.
Similar to our work, Pu et al. (2018) and Pu et al. (2017) also
study the query problem from an information-theoretic perspective. They show that maximizing the
mutual information between the input-output examples and the corresponding program greedily is
1 −1"
RELATED WORK,0.291220556745182,"e as good as the optimal solution that considers all examples globally. However, they assume
that the space of queries can be enumerated, which limits the application of their query algorithm
on complex datasets like Karel. By comparison, our work proposes a more general algorithm that
can generate queries in a nearly infinite space. Other related work including active learning and
black-box testing can be seen in Appendix D."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.2955032119914347,"In this work, we propose a query-based framework to finish the program synthesis task more re-
alistically. To optimize this framework, we show the correlation between the query strategy and
the mutual information. Moreover, we model the relevance between the input-output examples and
programs by introducing the F-space, where we represent the input-output examples as the distri-
bution of the programs. Using these techniques, we conduct a series of experiments that shows the
effectiveness, generalization, and scalability of our query-based framework. We believe that our
methods work not only on the program synthesis tasks, but also on any task that aims to simulate an
underlying oracle, including reverse engineering, symbolic regression, scientific discovery, and so
on."

The query encoder is the same as the one used by Bunel et al. (2018) composed of a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the residual link. After the query encoder, there is an
MLP to project the embedding into µ, log(σ2). The dimension of µ and σ is set to 256, and thus
the hidden size of MLP is 512. The query decoder is similar to the query encoder except that the
number of channels is reversed, and additional batch normalization is added to keep the generation
more stable. The program encoder is a two-layer LSTM with a hidden size of 256."

However, for the convenience of training, we set the size of the query world fixed to 16. Moreover,
to guarantee that all queries can be recognized by the program simulator, we split the query into three
parts: boundaries (the map size, set to 16×16), agent position (where the agent is and towards), and
map state (the placement of markers and obstacles), and generate them as follows:"

OTHER TRAINING TECHNIQUES"
REFERENCES,0.5867237687366167,"Latent code.
The subsequent queries are easy to fail into the mode collapse, generating simi-
lar queries repetitively. To tackle this problem, we introduce a latent code, like the one in Info-
GAN (Chen et al., 2016), as another input, which indicates the current query step, and ask the
encoder in the next query step to decode it accurately. Specifically, given a latent code c which
indicates the current query step, the query network is supposed to maximize the mutual information
between c and the output query x to alleviate the mode collapse problem. To generate x under the
condition of c, we concatenate c with the encoded representation µ and log(σ2), and then send it to
the decoder (Equation (9)), shown in Figure 6(g) and Figure 7(e). To maximize the mutual informa-
tion I(c; x), we design a network aiming to classify c from x, which models the distribution Q(c|x)
(details can be seen in Chen et al. (2016)). This network shares its parameters with the Encodere
(Equation (5)) except for the last layer, and it is optimized with the cross-entropy loss."
REFERENCES,0.588865096359743,"Gumbel-Softmax.
Note that the queries are discrete, which makes the query network cannot be
optimized by back-propagation. Thus, we take advantage of the Gumbel-Softmax distribution (Mad-
dison et al., 2017; Jang et al., 2017) and make the query process differentiable."
REFERENCES,0.5910064239828694,"Curriculum learning.
The query network is trained progressively. At the beginning of the train-
ing, the query network generates one query only. As the training goes on, the limit of the number of
queries increases until it achieves five. Specifically, this limit increases every two epochs. Curricu-
lum learning helps to make the training process more stable."

the reciprocal of the KL divergence between different queries on the same program as another loss
to make the queries more diverse. However, this loss does not have a significant impact on training
most of the time and makes the training process unstable, and thus it is abandoned in our final
version."

ACTIVE LEARNING"
E,0.9550321199143469,"Active learning is a research domain that aims to reduce the cost of labeling by selecting the most
representative samples iteratively from the unlabeled dataset and then asking them to an oracle
for labeling while training. According to Shui et al. (2020), active learning can be divided into
pool-based sampling (Angluin, 1988; King et al., 2004), which judges whether a sample should
be selected for query-based on the evaluation of the entire dataset; steam-based sampling (Dagan
& Argamon, 1995; Krishnamurthy, 2002), which judges each sample independently compared to
pool-based sampling; and membership query synthesis (Lewis & Gale, 1994), which means that the
unlabeled sample can be generated by the learner instead of selecting from the dataset only. Al-
though active learning involves querying an oracle iteratively, which is similar to our framework,
there are still two main differences between them. (1) For the final purpose, active learning aims to
finish the training stage at a low cost, and the inference stage remains the same as other machine
learning tasks without the query process, while our framework aims to find the oracle (i.e.the un-
derlying program) in a symbolic form, and the query process is retained during inference. (2) For
the query process, active learning assumes only one oracle (i.e.the same query always gets the same
label). In contrast, our framework assumes multiple oracles (i.e.the same query will get different
responses if the underlying programs are different)."

AUTOMATED BLACK-BOX TESTING"
E,0.9593147751605996,"Black-box testing is a method of software testing aiming to examine the functionality of a black-
box (such as a piece of a program) by a large number of test cases without perceiving its inter-
nal structures. The most famous automated test cases generation method is learning-based testing
(LBT) (Meinke, 2004; Meinke & Niu, 2010; Meinke & Sindhu, 2011). LBT is an iterative approach
to generate test cases by interacting with the black-box, which sounds similar to the query problem
mentioned in this paper. However, the settings and the purpose of the black-box testing are totally
different from ours. In detail, the black-box testing assumes the existence of a target requirement
(or target function) and a black-box implementation of this requirement (such as a piece of program
which is unknown). The purpose is to check the black-box implementation to ensure that there
is no bug or difference between the target requirement and the black-box by generating test cases
(i.e.input-output examples). In a contrast, in our settings, the target function does not exist, and all
we have is a black-box (or called oracle / underlying program in our paper). Our goal is to query
this black box and guess which program is hidden inside based on the experience learned from the
training set."
