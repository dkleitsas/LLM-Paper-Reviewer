ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0049504950495049506,"The objective in goal-based reinforcement learning is to learn a policy to reach
a particular goal state within the environment. However, the underlying reward
function may be too sparse for the agent to efﬁciently learn useful behaviors. Recent
studies have demonstrated that reward sparsity can be overcome by instead learning
a curriculum of simpler subtasks. In this work, we design an agent’s curriculum by
focusing on the aspect of goal reachability, and introduce the idea of a reachability
trace, which is used as a basis to determine a sequence of intermediate subgoals to
guide the agent towards its primary goal. We discuss several properties of the trace
function, and in addition, validate our proposed approach empirically in a range of
environments, while comparing its performance against appropriate baselines."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01485148514851485,"Reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 1998) has been successfully used to train agents in
domains such as robotics (Zhu et al., 2019), Atari games (Mnih et al., 2015) and other complex games
(Silver et al., 2018). The universal principle underpinning these applications is the maximization of the
long term expected rewards that the agent accumulates as it interacts with its environment. Following
each interaction, the agent receives a numerical reward, which is (generally) directly or indirectly
speciﬁed by a human user. The design of such reward functions is critical, as it fundamentally affects
both the rate of learning (Matignon et al., 2006), as well as the type of behaviors learned."
INTRODUCTION,0.019801980198019802,"Speciﬁcally, a sparse reward function makes learning challenging, as it deprives the agent of the
necessary feedback required to improve its behavior. This has been a widely studied problem in RL,
and although several potential solutions (Ng et al., 1999; Vecerik et al., 2017; Narvekar et al., 2020)
have been proposed, it remains an active area of research."
INTRODUCTION,0.024752475247524754,"Apart from sparsity, the reward function could also suffer from improper speciﬁcations, such as
inappropriately chosen reward values for certain states or actions, which could distract the agent from
its intended task. The consequences of such mis-speciﬁcations have been recorded in works such
as Burda et al. (2018), where the RL agent, rewarded for curious behaviors, was shown to become
distracted from its original task due to local sources of entropy (A TV with randomly changing
channels). Similar effects have also been observed in Clark & Amodei (2016), where the agent,
tasked with safely completing a boat race circuit, unexpectedly exploited the improperly designed
reward function, and learned undesirable behaviors."
INTRODUCTION,0.0297029702970297,"In this work, we propose the idea of reachability traces, which is based solely on the reachability
of the goal state, and is independent of other aspects of the reward function. Similar to the idea
of eligibility traces (Singh & Sutton, 1996) in classical RL, reachability traces model the temporal
closeness (i.e., number of steps to the goal) of states/state-action pairs leading to the goal by assigning
diminishing reachability values (traces) to these states, looking backwards from the goal state. These
reachability values are approximated through a reachability trace function, which is realized through
a simple feedforward neural network, updated online during learning. We also show that alternatively,
reachability traces could be learned using an MDP (Markov Decision Process) framework (Puterman,
2014), guaranteeing its convergence in tabular environments. Once learned, the reachability trace
provides an indication of the temporal closeness to the goal state, which is used to autonomously
determine a sequence of achievable subgoals, which are subsequently learned. The sequence of
subgoals are chosen in increasing order of their reachability trace values, which ensures that subgoals
appearing later in the sequence are temporally closer to the goal state, and thus have a higher chance"

INTRODUCTION,0.039603960396039604,"of reaching the goal. The corresponding subpolicies, once learned, are used to provide the agent with
action advice (Fachantidis et al., 2019), thereby guiding it towards the goal region. The use of action
advice (accompanied by a non-zero probability of random exploration) to guide our off-policy agent
implies the preservation of its convergence properties in tabular environments. We demonstrate our
approach in sparse (discrete as well as continuous) goal based RL tasks and compare its performance
against several other baselines. We also discuss and empirically demonstrate other use cases of
reachability traces, such as in environments with poorly designed reward functions. In summary, the
main contributions of this work are:"

REACHABILITY TRACES"
REACHABILITY TRACES,0.054455445544554455,"In goal based tasks, the aim of the agent is to learn a policy to reach a predetermined goal state.
Depending on the reward function in question, the probability of reaching such a goal state may
or may not be correlated with the (action-) value function of the agent. This is because the value
function, which is solely designed to maximize the expected return, does not explicitly depend on
goal state visits. For example, value function based learning would need to account for non-goal
rewards, which (if improperly speciﬁed) could distract the agent from its intended task (Burda et al.,
2018; Clark & Amodei, 2016). Particularly in environments where the goal rewards are sparse, we
posit that it is more beneﬁcial to exploit the rare trajectories that lead to the goal state, by learning
about their goal-reaching properties, and subsequently using this knowledge to guide the agent’s
exploration. We posit that this goal-reaching property be characterized through reachability traces,
which is solely based on the temporal distance to the goal state under the agent’s behavior policy."
REACHABILITY TRACES,0.0594059405940594,"In classical RL, a concept that models the idea of temporal closeness is eligibility traces (Singh &
Sutton, 1996). Although the primary motivation behind eligibility traces was to address the credit
assignment problem, it was designed in a way that states/state-action pairs that were temporally more
closely related to an event (a state or action), were assigned higher trace values compared to those
that were temporally further away. Here, we use a similar idea to build a reachability trace function
using historically successful trajectories. Unlike eligibility traces, reachability traces are learned as
a neural network and are concerned solely with reaching the goal state, and modeling the temporal
distance to the goal, which in this work, is used to evaluate the suitability of potential subgoals."
REACHABILITY TRACES,0.06435643564356436,"Assuming a behavior policy π, we consider a successful trajectory TS = {st...st+k, ...st+N} which

It is to be noted that traces are updated looking backwards from the terminal/goal state as per Equation
1. Trace labels are assigned to ensure that states temporally closer to the goal state are associated with
higher trace values, and those further away are associated with lower values. States in unsuccessful
trajectories are assigned a trace label of 0. These assigned trace labels are then be used to learn
a reachability trace function φπ(s) : s →eπ(s), which maps states (or state-action pairs) to their
corresponding trace labels. Given enough successful trajectories, the learned reachability trace φ(s)
would converge to the expected trace value:"

trajectory. We do not require that this trajectory be optimal; only that it enounters the goal state G
and terminates. As we obtain trace labels for multiple states upon visiting the goal, even a single
successful trajectory could help build a rough estimate of the trace function. Our approach is also
suitable to be used in the availability of (suboptimal) demonstrations, as described in Appendix D."

subsequent subgoals that are likely to be closer to G. In this work, the reachability trace is realized
through a simple feedforward neural network, trained on data of states and corresponding trace labels
generated from successful and unsuccessful trajectories, which are stored in separate buffers. The
steps to be followed to learn a trace function have been described in Algorithm 1. Here, successful
and unsuccessful trajectories are sampled with equal probability, which causes the learned trace to
be a biased estimate of that mentioned in Equation 2. Despite this bias, we ﬁnd that the learned
reachability trace serves as an approximate measure of temporal proximity, and is still a useful basis
for selecting subgoals. In addition, as our approach does not require generated suboals to lie on
the optimal path, the use of this biased estimate is justiﬁed. Although reachability traces have been
described only in terms of states (for the sake of simplicity), similar to the case in eligibility traces, it
can also be extended to state-action pairs (φπ(s, a))."

reachable (from the starting state), while a low φ value may indicate that the state is further away
from the goal state (and thus temporally closer to the starting state), and thus may consitute an easier
subgoal to be learned. In this work, we treat this temporal proximity as a proxy for subgoal difﬁculty,
and use it as a basis for building a task curriculum (Portelas et al., 2020; Narvekar et al., 2020) in
sparse reward problems. The idea is to ﬁrst learn simple subgoals (low φ) and progressively move to
more difﬁcult ones till the main task is solved."
SUBGOAL GENERATION AND CURRICULUM BUILDING,0.14356435643564355,"We consider a sparse-reward MDP (main task) M = {S, A, R, T , G, s0}, with state space S, action
space A, reward function R, and transition function T . s0 and G represent the start and terminal
goal states respecitvely. Under the standard learning scenario, learning an optimal policy π∗to solve
this sparse reward MDP may become prohibitively sample inefﬁcient. However, if we have learned a
trace function φ, M can be simpliﬁed into a sequence of subtasks M = [M0...Mi...MN ] such that
each Mi ∈M is a subtask MDP Mi = {S, A, Ri, Ti, gi, si} sharing the same state-action space,
with its own reward function Ri, start state si and terminal goal state gi. The starting state for the
subsequent subtask is set as the goal state of the previous one; that is, si = gi−1. The transition
function Ti is assumed to be identical to T , except that as per Ti, gi is terminal, whereas T assumes
termination at G. The subtask sequence is such that for any two subtasks Mi, Mj, where j > i,
φ(gj) > tφφ(gi), tφ (≥1) is a subgoal trace scaling factor. Choosing large values of tφ would result
in subgoals spaced temporally farther, while smaller values of tφ could be expected to return subgoals
that are temporally close to one another. Guidelines for selecting tφ are described in Appendix B.
The reward ri(s) corresponding to the reward function Ri for each subtask is binary, such that:"

SUBGOAL GENERATION AND CURRICULUM BUILDING,0.15346534653465346,"In order to identify subgoals online, the agent is allowed to interact with the environment in an
episodic manner, till it encounters a state smax corresponding to the highest φ value experienced
during the episode, which also exceeds the trace value of the latest subgoal state gi. That is, if
φ(smax) > tφφ(gi), smax is considered to be the new subgoal (gi+1), and accordingly, subtask
Mi+1 is generated with high rewards corresponding to state gi+1, and 0 rewards for all other states.
For each such subtask, a corresponding subpolicy is learned, following which the same process is
repeated to generate the next subtask, and so on till the goal state G is reached. The fact that only
previously visited states are chosen as subgoals ensures that the chosen subgoals are indeed reachable.
At this point, the main task M would be decomposed into several subtasks consisting of subgoals of
progressively increasing difﬁculty (Figure 6, Appendix B), whose subpolicies are learned in sequence.
Although these subpolicies are used to guide the agent towards the goal (described in Section 4), they
can also potentially be reused (Fernández & Veloso, 2006) to aid transfer learning (Appendix E). The
processes involved for subgoal generation and curriculum building are described in Algorithm 2."

increasing difﬁculty/trace values, it does not guarantee that they lie on the optimal path to the goal
state G. However, in this work, as the subpolicies only serve to guide the agent via action advice, it is
guaranteed to eventually converge (in the tabular case) to the optimal policy."
CURRICULUM GUIDED LEARNING,0.16831683168316833,"To learn the main policy, the corresponding Q−function Q(s, a) is updated online with off policy

and executing it with a probability ϵ (while maintaining a small non-zero probability δ > 0 of
taking random actions), and otherwise acting greedily with respect to Q. The requirement of δ > 0
is enforced to ensure sufﬁcient exploration in the case of highly suboptimal subgoals. Once the
subgoal of the corresponding subpolicy is reached, the agent receives subsequent advice from the

performance of the agent (in terms of total goal visits) in all the environments and across other

THE CASE OF POORLY DESIGNED REWARD FUNCTIONS,0.35148514851485146,"Figure 5: (a) Environment with starting state s0, goal G and non-terminal rewards at sNT , and (b)
corresponding performance over 5 trials."
THE CASE OF POORLY DESIGNED REWARD FUNCTIONS,0.3564356435643564,"agents move towards sNT and remain there, receiving a reward of 0.02 until the episode terminates
(optimal episode return= 3.65). In contrast to this, the shortest path towards the goal state G would
only result in a return of −1. This causes reward maximizing agents to become distracted, and
learn policies that lead them towards sNT . However, with the use of reachability traces, the agent
is primarily concerned with task completion (visiting the goal state), and as a result, ignores sNT
despite the presence of a distrative reward. As our approach relies on the reachability trace function
to generate subgoals, it increases the likelihood that subsequently generated subgoals lie temporally
closer to the goal state. This is not the case even in other goal-conditioned approaches like RIS, for
example, where subgoal generation is dependent on the agent’s value function. As a result, the RIS
baseline tends to generate subgoals in high value regions (i.e., around sNT ) and hence experiences a
noisy performance initially. However, RIS being a goal-conditioned approach, eventually discovers
paths leading to the goal state. For these reasons, our approach results in faster and more stable
learning in the environment in Figure 5 (a), leading to a higher frequency of goal state visits."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.36633663366336633,"Several works have attempted to resolve the sparse reward problem. Reward shaping (Ng et al.,
1999) was among the earliest of such approaches wherein the original reward function of the agent
was made less sparse by appending it with a special shaping term which left the resulting policy
unaffected. Directed and curiosity-based exploration (Thrun, 1992; Burda et al., 2018; Savinov
et al., 2018) is another family of approaches designed to speed up learning in general, including in
reward-sparse environments. However, these methods are generally designed for better exploration,
and not speciﬁcally for goal-directed behaviors."
RELATED WORK,0.3712871287128713,"For long-horizon tasks, hierarchical RL (Dayan & Hinton, 1993; Wiering & Schmidhuber, 1997;
Levy et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021) is a suitable approach, where often, a high level policy controls
the execution of several low-level intermediate subpolicies. However, as mentioned in Nachum
et al. (2018), the joint learning of these policies can be problematic, and lead to non-stationarity and
instability. Although we follow a similar approach of decomposing a goal into multiple subgoals, we
use the corresponding subpolicies only to guide the learning of the main policy."
RELATED WORK,0.37623762376237624,"The subgoals generated in our approach is based on the trace function, whose trace values are
propagated backwards following a successful trajectory. Lee et al. (2019) proposed similar backward
updates in discrete action environments, but the updates were performed on the action value function
itself. Although these backward updates were demonstrated to result in faster learning in environments
with discrete action spaces, they failed to account for reachability, making them susceptible to failure
in environments with poorly designed rewards. Similar to our approach, Savinov et al. (2018)
explored the idea of reachability, where a neural network was used to estimate the number of steps
separating the current observation from past observations. This prediction was used to generate a
bonus reward to encourage exploration into novel regions. Our proposed reachability traces approach,"

RELATED WORK,0.3910891089108911,"Among curriculum learning approaches, RIS (Chane-Sane et al., 2021) is the most closely related.
The authors aim to learn a high-level policy by generating subgoals based on a value function as a
reachability metric. The idea is to pick intermediate goal states that are halfway (as per the value
function distance metric) to the goal location. Although our approach also relies on a higher-level
function to determine subgoals, we choose our subgoals based on the learned trace function, which
beneﬁts from the backward propagation of trace values, making it a better choice compared to the
value function. Choosing subgoals based on value functions could also fail in cases where the reward
function is poorly designed. The trace function, which is based on reachability, does not suffer from
such issues. In addition, our subgoal selection strategy is to pick a reachable state with a trace value
that is higher than that of the previous subgoal. We believe that this reachability-focused approach is
more grounded than the arbitrary criterion of halfway distances."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.40594059405940597,"We presented reachability trace functions, a novel approach for designing a task curriculum to
overcome problems posed by sparse rewards in goal based tasks. We showed how this function
approximates the temporal closeness to the goal state, and described how it can be used to construct a
task curriculum. Through several discrete as well and continuous maze navigation environments, we
empirically demonstrated the ability of our approach to efﬁciently handle sparse rewards. Finally,
we also brieﬂy discussed and empirically demonstrated an alternative use-case of our approach -
handling environments with poorly designed reward functions, where reward maximizing agents fail."

subgoals that are further apart from each other, causing the total number of subgoals (and subpolicies)

better in the presence of demonstrations, owing to the fact that the provided demonstrations are used

in contrast to the demonstration free case, where the agent is required to ﬁrst discover successful
trajectories through interaction. Nevertheless, our approach can be used either with or without
demonstrations. All results reported in the main text correspond to learning without demonstrations."

case, where the goal state in Figure 2 (a) is changed, with all other environment properties preserved.
In such a case, we demonstrate that reusing previously learned subpolicies through probabilistic
policy reuse (Fernández & Veloso, 2006) can signiﬁcantly accelerate learning. Although this type of
reuse is possible even with subpolicies learned via other curriculum learning approaches, we believe
our method enables the learning of subpolicies whose subgoals are temporally sufﬁciently apart,

HYPERPARAMETER SETTINGS"
REFERENCES,0.9158415841584159,"In these environments, the exploration parameter ϵ decayed linearly from 1 to a minimum of 0.1. The
DDPG base agent used in the continuous maze tasks used the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014)
and a critic and target networks as multi-layer perceptrons of 3 and 2 layers respectively, with the
former having 1024, 512 and 300 nodes in its three layers, and the latter with 512 and 128 nodes in
its layers. The polyak averaging hyperparameter used was set to τ = 0.01. For the PER baseline,
we used proportional prioritization with a temperature parameter of 0.01. Each continuous maze
environment was performed on an Nvidia Tesla V100 (32GB) GPU, and on average, took about 6
hours per trial for U-Maze and about 12 hours per trial for the other continuous mazes."

128 nodes. The optimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 1e −3."

OTHER IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS"
REFERENCES,0.9306930693069307,"Efﬁcient Trace Updates:As per the procedures outline in Algorithm 1, we train the trace network
at each step. However, this may become prohibitively expensive, and thus impractical in terms of
wall-clock time. In order to counter this issue, we keep track of the latest interaction that led to the
goal state, at which point we set a spiking signal ζ to 1. This spiking signal is then subsequently
decayed exponentially as ζt+1 = dζt, where d, the decay rate is set to 0.9. The trace network is
then updated with a probability ζ, such that immediately after a goal state visit, the trace network is
updated frequently, following which it is updated progressively less frequently."
REFERENCES,0.9356435643564357,"Off-policy updates: As our learning agent is updated in an off-policy manner, its action values can
simultaneuosly be updated in parallel during the environment interactions in Algorithm 1 and 2, and
not just in Algorithm 3."
REFERENCES,0.9405940594059405,"Curriculum guidance:In Algorithm 3, although we use a ﬁxed value of ϵ = 0.1, as per standard
practice, ϵ could be set to decay with time, decreasing the reliance on subpolicies with more learning
updates. A potential drawback of this strategy is that the agent may receive less frequent advice
from subpolicies further down the sequence. However, the agent, having been guided by subpoliciies
earlier in the sequence, is likely to be closer to the goal state at this stage, and is thus less likely to be
affected by the low frequency of advice."
REFERENCES,0.9455445544554455,"Baseline implementation:For a fair comparison, in all our experiments, the RIS baselines only used
the subgoal generation strategy from Chane-Sane et al. (2021) without the use of hindsight experience
replay (Andrychowicz et al., 2017)."
