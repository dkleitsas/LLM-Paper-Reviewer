ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.005434782608695652,"Current Reinforcement Learning algorithms have reached new heights in perfor-
mance. However, such algorithms often require hundreds of millions of samples,
often resulting in policies that are unable to transfer between tasks without full
retraining. Successor features aim to improve this situation by decomposing the
policy into two components: one capturing environmental dynamics and the other
modelling reward. Where the reward function is formulated as the linear combi-
nation of learned state features and a learned parameter vector. Under this form,
transfer between related tasks now only requires training the reward component.
In this paper, we propose a novel extension to the successor feature framework
resulting in a natural second-order variant. After derivation of the new state-action
value function, a second additive term emerges, this term predicts reward as a
non-linear combination of state features while providing additional beneﬁts. Exper-
imentally, we show that this term explicitly models the environment’s stochasticity
and can also be used in place of ϵ-greedy exploration methods during transfer.
The performance of the proposed extension to the successor feature framework is
validated empirically on a 2D navigation task, the control of a simulated robotic
arm, and the Doom environment."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.016304347826086956,"Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have achieved superhuman performance in sev-
eral challenging domains, such as Atari (Mnih et al., 2015), Go (Silver et al., 2016), and Starcraft
II(Vinyals et al., 2019). The main driver of these successes has been the use of deep neural net-
works, which are a class of powerful non-linear function approximators, with RL algorithms(LeCun
et al., 2015). However, this class of Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) algorithms require
immense amounts of data within an environment, often ranging from tens to hundreds of millions of
samples(Arulkumaran et al., 2017). Furthermore, commonly used algorithms often have difﬁculty
in transferring a learned policy between related tasks, such as where the environmental dynamics
remain constant, but the goal changes. In this case, the model must either be retrained completely
or ﬁne-tuned on the new task, in both cases requiring millions of additional samples. If the state
dynamics are constant, but the reward structure varies between tasks, it is wasteful to retrain the entire
model."
INTRODUCTION,0.021739130434782608,"A more pragmatic approach would be to decompose the RL agent’s policy such that separate functions
can learn the state dynamics and the reward structure; doing so enables reuse of the dynamics model
and only requires learning the reward component. Successor features (Dayan, 1993) do precisely
this; a model-free policy’s action-value function is expressed as the dot product between a vector of
expected discounted future state occupancies, the successor features, and another vector representing
the immediate reward in each of those successor states. The factorization follows from the formulation
of the reward as the dot product between a state representation vector and a learned parameter vector,
that is a linear product. Therefore, transfer to a new task requires relearning only the reward
parameters instead of the entire model and amounts to the supervised learning problem of predicting
the current state’s immediate reward."
INTRODUCTION,0.02717391304347826,"As the reward function of the successor feature framework is linear, it is fair to question whether
the model can always accurately predict the reward. As no assumptions are made about the state
representation, theoretically it is possible to enable perfect recovery of any reward function if given"

INTRODUCTION,0.03804347826086957,"predictive state representation Barreto et al. (2017). The state representation, within the successor
feature framework, is learned end-to-end by a state encoder to perform well in state reconstruction
and reward prediction tasks. The state encoder, given a large enough set of parameters, should have
enough representational power to disentangle the factors that are useful for reward prediction by a
linear model. However, because of how the encoder is trained, its parameters are utilized for both
state reconstruction and reward prediction tasks; while the reward model parameters are only used for
reward prediction. If the encoder learns a sub-optimal state representation for reward prediction, say
because of a highly complex environment, the reward model might be unable to compensate with its
limited set of parameters correctly to predict the reward. Eysenbach et al. (2018) and Hansen et al.
(2019) have shown, within the successor feature framework, that there is no strong guarantee that the
state encoder is always able to learn features that enable accurate modelling of the reward."
INTRODUCTION,0.043478260869565216,"In this paper, a novel extension to the successor feature framework is proposed, where the rewards
are modelled with a second-order function. The second-order function, which follows naturally from
the original linear variant, gives a stronger guarantee on performance of the model due to both its
representational structure and extra parameters. This is especially true in cases where the encoder
learns state representations that are less than optimal where a linear model does not have enough rep-
resentational power to compensate. While, in cases where the encoder can learn sufﬁcient represents
for both reconstruction and reward tasks, the second-order function still provides many added beneﬁts.
In particular, the additional parameters of the reward model should lessen the representation load
of the encoder with regards to the reward tasks allowing more of its representational capacity to be
dedicated towards modelling the environment in a task agnostic manner. Further beneﬁts, via a new
term emerging after derivation, include a representational form of environmental stochasticity and
the ability to use directed exploration during transfer instead of relying on a purely random approach
for exploration, such as ϵ-greedy."

REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,0.08695652173913043,"Consider the interaction between an agent and an environment modelled by a Markov decision
process (MDP) (Puterman, 2014). An MDP is deﬁned as a set of states S, a set of actions A, a reward
function R : S →R, a discount factor γ ∈[0, 1], and a transition function T : S × A →[0, 1]. The
transition function gives the next-state distribution upon taking action a in state s and is often referred
to as the dynamics of the MDP."

SUCCESSOR FEATURES"
SUCCESSOR FEATURES,0.1358695652173913,"Successor Features (SF) offer a decomposition of the Q-value function and have been mentioned
under various names and interpretations(Dayan, 1993; Kulkarni et al., 2016; Barreto et al., 2017;
Machado et al., 2017). This decomposition follows from the assumption that the reward function
can be approximately represented as a linear combination of learned features φ(s; θφ) extracted by a
neural network with parameters θφ and a reward weight vector w. As such, the expected one-step
reward can be computed as: r(s, a) = φ(s, a; θφ)⊤w. Following from this, the Q function can be
rewritten as:"

SUCCESSOR FEATURES,0.15760869565217392,"where ψπ(s, a) are referred to as the successor features under policy π. The ith component of ψ(s, a)
provides the expected discounted sum of φ(i)

when following policy π starting from state s and
action a. It is assumed that the features φ(s; θφ) are representative of the state s, such that ψ(.) can
be turned into a function ψπ(φ(st; θφ), at). For brevity, φ(st; θφ) is referred to simply as φt and
ψπ(s, a) as ψ(s, a)."
SUCCESSOR FEATURES,0.16304347826086957,"The decomposition neatly separates the Q-function into two learning problems, for ψπ and w:
estimating the features under the current policy dynamics and estimating the reward given a state.
Because the decomposition still has the same form as the Q-function, the successor features are
computed using a Bellman equation update in which the reward function is replaced by φt:"

Learning(Szepesvári, 2009)."
SUCCESSOR FEATURES,0.1793478260869565,"Following from this, the approximation of the reward vector w becomes a supervised learning
problem. Often, this weight is learned using ordinary least squares from the sampled environmental
data. One beneﬁt of having a decoupled representation is that only the relevant function must be
relearned when either the dynamics or the reward changes. Therefore, if the task changes, but the
environmental dynamics remain constant, only the reward vector parameters w must be relearned,
which are minimal compared to the total number of parameters in the full model."

MODEL, ARCHITECTURE, AND TRAINING"
SUCCESSOR FEATURES,0.1956521739130435,"A natural extension to the Successor Feature framework begins by adjusting the fundamental structure
of how the reward is represented. In this work, a second-order extension is proposed that improves the
ﬂexibility of the reward function while providing other beneﬁts. This paper shows that by improving
the representational power of the reward component, with a non-linear function of the state, it provides
a stronger guarantee of the framework’s performance in such cases by developing a more robust
reward component."
SUCCESSOR FEATURES,0.20108695652173914,"This section discusses our change to the successor feature framework, which adjusts the reward
function, from a linear function, to a non-linear function. First, a discussion of the new decomposition

NON-LINEAR REWARD FUNCTION"
NON-LINEAR REWARD FUNCTION,0.21195652173913043,"The successor feature framework builds upon functional representation of the current reward rt as
a linear combination of the current state representation φt(s) ∈Rz and a learned reward vector
w ∈Rz, such that rt = φt(s)⊤w. In this paper we extend the reward model by changing this linear
reward model to one with the following form:"

transformation with respect to φt(s). From here on, we use φt instead of φt(s) for brevity. With
a slight abuse of notation, we can see the original formulation leads to this if w is replaced with
o+Aφ: rt = φ⊤(o+Aφ). The state-action value function Q(s, a), under this new reward structure,
can be derived to yield:"

necessary to model Λ, which outputs an Rz×z matrix per action. The quantity φtφ⊤
t can be interpreted
as an auto-correlation matrix of the state features. We can see that this form allows the Λ term to
model some form of future expected stochasticity of the environment. For example, the diagonal of
Λ will model a second order moment capturing each feature’s change with respect to itself φ1. We
provide analysis and further discussion of Λ in Section 4.5."

MODEL STRUCTURE AND TRAINING"
MODEL STRUCTURE AND TRAINING,0.2608695652173913,"The proposed model, shown in Figure 1a, uses an encoder to produce a state embedding φt consumed
by downstream modelling tasks. Figure 1b shows how the current reward rt is predicted using w,
with w = o + Aφ, and current state representation φt; this process is deﬁned in Equation 1. Similar
to previous work with successor features, the structure includes pathways for an encode-decode task
and successor feature prediction ψ(Machado et al., 2017; Kulkarni et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017).
The decoder network ensures that the features learned by the encoder, which produces φ, contain
useful information for prediction. Furthermore, only the gradients from the state-dependent and
reward prediction tasks modify the encoder parameters, and therefore φ. An additional branch is
added, by way of the non-linear reward function, to model the quantity Λ(s, a). This branch’s output
is a matrix, which differs from the vector predicting branches ψ and φ."

to model only the upper triangular portion of the matrix2, requiring about half the number of
parameters. To further reduce parameters, each ψ and Λ pathways have two hidden layers before
their outputs, reﬂected in Figure 1a. In this way, the parameters are shared amongst pathways, which
contrasts with other works with multiple sets of layers per action a ∈A (Kulkarni et al., 2016; Zhang

state representation φ can learn features that are both a good predictor of the reward rt and useful in
discriminating between states (Kulkarni et al., 2016)."

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP"
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.45108695652173914,"The agent is trained on a randomly sampled training tasks; then, during testing, we change to a
unseen task. A single policy π is trained over all tasks. During transfer to unseen tasks, the model
re-learns only the reward parameters, with the remainder of the model frozen (Zhang et al., 2017;
Kulkarni et al., 2016). The newly learned policy will vary from the original but is able to exploit
previously learned environment knowledge for the new tasks. The training and testing methodology
is identical to those used in previous studies (Barreto et al., 2017). A uniform random action baseline
was considered in all environments to act as a ﬂoor."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.45652173913043476,"Within the Doom environment, we are simply interested in the performance between the second-order
model and that of the linear baseline. Therefore, we do not use a train and test split in this environment
but instead rely on the randomness of the item and agent spawn locations."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.46195652173913043,"Our method is compared against the successor feature framework with a linear reward model; the
architecture is similar to that of Kulkarni et al. (2016). This baseline is identical in all ways to the
second-order model except for the exclusion of terms containing Λ, speciﬁcally Equations 2 and 9,
which can be obtained by setting β = 0. More exactly, the linear baseline and our proposed model
use the exact same code with only the β and z hyperparameters adjusted."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.4673913043478261,"In all environments we adjust the dimension of the latent representation of φt to ensure that the
second-order variant has less than or equal parameters to that of the linear variant. This ensure that
the performance from the second-order variant is not from the additional parameters alone. In both
the Axes and Reacher environments, the linear variant uses a hidden dimensionality of 24 while the
second-order variant has 8. In the Axes, the linear model has 5, 704 parameters and the second-order
model has 2, 100 parameters. While, within the Reacher environment this led to 16, 710 and 7, 318
total parameters for the linear and second-order variants, respectively."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.47282608695652173,"In the case of the Doom environment, to again ensure that the performance of the second-order
variant is not due to additional parameters, the linear model uses a large three layer convolutional
encoder and the second-order model uses a much smaller two layer encoder. This leads to a total
of 343M and 276M parameters for the linear and second-order models, respectively. Each model’s
mean performance is reported on all plots as the average over three runs with varied seeds. Each plot
includes the standard deviation over all runs as a shaded area. Additional details can be found in

ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE,0.4945652173913043,"Reacher. In both environments, we see that the easy task is solved by both the linear and second-order
variants. This is expected as the reward, in the case of the linear variant, can be exactly recovered by
using a 1-hot encoded reward vector and even with a weaker state representation the linear reward
model has enough capacity to compensate. However, we see this is not true in the hard task, as the
linear variant has weaker performance when compared to the second-order model."
ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE,0.5,"Figure 4: Performance of the baseline linear vari-
ant and our proposed second-order model in the
Doom environment."
ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE,0.5054347826086957,"Clearly, the second-order variant provides extra
representational capacity to the reward model
such that it can compensate on its own for a
non-ideal state representation – which is shown
by the greater performance on the hard tasks.
The linear variant, is not able to appropriately
model the environments reward structure as the
reward is a non-linear function of the state; in
this case, the agent’s coordinates and the current
goal location."
ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE,0.5108695652173914,"From the result within the Doom environment,
shown in Figure 4, we can see that our proposed
model is clearly able to out perform the base-
line successor feature implementation. Not only
does our proposed method is near the ceiling
performance of the environment, it converges
rapidly. In comparison, the baseline method
fails to achieve similar performance and also
converges at a much slower rate. From the dif-
ference in learning curves we can conclude that
the extra representational power of the reward model has a drastic impact on performance. As both
variants have roughly equal parameters, with the linear variant containing more, it can be conclude
that the extra representational power is of better use in the reward component of the model instead of
the encoder."

TASK TRANSFER"
TASK TRANSFER,0.5217391304347826,"An important property of the successor feature framework is the ability to adapt rapidly to new tasks
within the same environment. Adaption, or transfer, is accomplished by freezing the model’s state-
dependent components, such as ψ, and quickly learning just the reward parameters w. Speciﬁcally,
we minimize Lr(st; o, A) = [rt −φ⊤
t o + βφ⊤
t Aφt]2, of Equation 8, with respect to the parameters
o and A only. Similarly, after training the models to convergence, we change the task distribution
within the environment. During transfer, we scaled the learning rate by a ﬁxed factor, randomly
initialize the learned weights, and re-decay the ϵ value so the method has a chance to explore. Full
details are provided in Appendix E. The results during transfer on both environments are provided in
Table 3."

MODELLING ENVIRONMENTAL STOCHASTICITY"
MODELLING ENVIRONMENTAL STOCHASTICITY,0.5489130434782609,"This section examines the Λ function to determine whether it can capture stochasticity in the environ-
ment in the Axes environment. We use a modiﬁed version, referred to as half-random and shown in
Figure 5a, which is identical in all aspects to the base version except for a location-based conditional
that affects the agent’s actions. If the agent is within the positive x quadrant of the map, x > 0,
then actions are randomly perturbed with a ﬁxed probability. Otherwise, they are fully deterministic.
After training to convergence on the half-random variant, we examine the Λ function that the model
has learned. Because the Λ function is modelling the auto-correlation matrix, the future expected
correlation of each feature with itself is found by looking along the diagonal. Figure 5b shows the
result of plotting a diagonal value, in this case, feature (1, 1), of the Λ-matrix over the entire state
space. We can see that one of the diagonal components of Λ did indeed learn to approximately model
the conditional random ﬁeld within the environment."

MODELLING ENVIRONMENTAL STOCHASTICITY,0.5652173913043478,"The Successor Features, given in Equation 2, can be interpreted as predicting the future expected
path taken by the policy π in an environment. Under this interpretation, ψ can be seen as capturing
the expected features of the states and Λ the expected variance between state features along these
pathways. Adding noise to the Λ component would then perturb around the expected path. Therefore,
instead of using ϵ-greedy exploration, it is possible to add noise to Λ during transfer, such that
ˆΛ(s, a) = Λ(s, a) + ϵΛ(s, a), where ϵ is sampled from some distribution. During learning, the
variance of the sampling distribution, controlled by α, can be annealed to some ﬁnal value. The actions
are then sampled from the model at time t as: at = argmaxa∗

CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK,0.592391304347826,"In this paper, we have derived a novel formulation of successor features with a non-linear reward. We
have shown that the agent can perform well with a second-order reward structure, providing extra
ﬂexibility to the reward model. Further, we have shown the utility of the Λ term that appears in the
derivation of the new state-action function. Experimentally, we have shown that the Λ term is able
to capture the stochastic nature of an environment and can be used for directed exploration during
transfer. In future work, we aim to explore the Λ function deeply and if a formulation exists that
learns the future expected variance."

other model parameters are held frozen and do not change. The learning rate is increased by a factor
of 2× on the Axes and Reacher environments. We anneal the exploration parameter from 1 to 0.1 in
Axes and to 0.05 on the Reacher environments over the ﬁrst 200k steps."
