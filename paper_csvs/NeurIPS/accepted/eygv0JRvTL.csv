ABSTRACT,0.001567398119122257,"Bayesian Optimization (BO) is widely used for optimising black-box functions but
requires us to specify the length scale hyperparameter, which defines the smooth-
ness of the functions the optimizer will consider. Most current BO algorithms
choose this hyperparameter by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the observed
data, albeit risking misspecification if the objective function is less smooth in
regions we have not yet explored. The only prior solution addressing this problem
with theoretical guarantees was A-GP-UCB, proposed by Berkenkamp et al. (2019).
This algorithm progressively decreases the length scale, expanding the class of
functions considered by the optimizer. However, A-GP-UCB lacks a stopping
mechanism, leading to over-exploration and slow convergence. To overcome this,
we introduce Length scale Balancing (LB)—a novel approach, aggregating mul-
tiple base surrogate models with varying length scales. LB intermittently adds
smaller length scale candidate values while retaining longer scales, balancing ex-
ploration and exploitation. We formally derive a cumulative regret bound of LB
and compare it with the regret of an oracle BO algorithm using the optimal length
scale. Denoting the factor by which the regret bound of A-GP-UCB was away from
oracle as g(T), we show that LB is only log g(T) away from oracle regret. We also
empirically evaluate our algorithm on synthetic and real-world benchmarks and
show it outperforms A-GP-UCB, maximum likelihood estimation and MCMC."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.004702194357366771,"Bayesian Optimisation (BO) [16] has proven to be an efficient solution for black-box optimisation
problems, finding applications across science, engineering and machine learning [12, 18, 23]. As
a model-based optimisation technique, BO constructs a surrogate model of the black box function,
which is typically a Gaussian Process (GP) [40]. However, to construct this surrogate, we need to
specify our expectations about the smoothness of the black-box function. In the case of GP, the choice
of smoothness is reflected in the selection of an appropriate length scale value for the kernel function.
Selecting smaller length scales allows us to model less smooth functions and, as such, expands the
class of all possible black-box functions the optimiser will consider. At the same time, it makes
the convergence of the algorithm slower, due to an increase in the number of possible ‘candidate’
functions, the algorithm has to explore the space much more. As such, we wish to consider the
smallest possible class of functions that still contains the black-box function we wish to solve. This
translates to selecting some optimal length scale value, which is neither too short nor too long."

INTRODUCTION,0.0109717868338558,"Figure 1: An objective function (proposed by [6])
that illustrates the importance of length scales to
BO. The blue line shows a GP fit with shaded
regions representing one standard deviation. The
length scale value was set to the optimal value
on the left and was selected by MLE on the right,
based on five points represented by dots. While the
optimiser with the MLE of length scale persistently
selects a suboptimal value of x = 1, the optimiser
with the optimal length scale can spot the hidden
peak leading to finding the maximum at x∗= 0.3."
INTRODUCTION,0.012539184952978056,"Appropriate selection of the length scale param-
eter can be challenging. Typical practice is to
fit the length scale value by maximum likeli-
hood estimation (MLE) on the observed data
we have collected thus far. However, it is en-
tirely possible that the function changes less
smoothly in the regions we have not explored
yet, as shown in Figure 1. As such, we cannot
guarantee that maximising the likelihood of the
limited, observed data will find a length scale
value such that the black-box function will lie in
the space of considered functions. A previously
proposed algorithm called A-GP-UCB [6] ap-
proached this issue by progressively decreasing
the length scale value, and as such increasing the
class of functions considered by the optimiser.
As a consequence, at some point, it must con-
tain the black-box function we are trying to opti-
mise. However, the algorithm has no mechanism
for stopping and as such the length scale value
will decrease indefinitely, inexorably expanding
the class of considered functions. This causes
over-exploration, making the convergence much
slower compared to an optimiser that knows the
optimal length scale value."
INTRODUCTION,0.014106583072100314,"A-GP-UCB is suboptimal because it never returns to previously trialled, longer length scales. Observe
that if trying a shorter length scale value does not improve function discovery, opting for a longer scale
is a safer choice, preventing excessive exploration. To build an algorithm following this intuition, we
could have a number of base optimisers, each utilising a different length scale value, and aggregate
them into a single ‘master’ optimiser. By knowing how explorative each of the base optimisers is, the
‘master’ optimiser could select the most suitable one at each iteration, so as to balance exploration and
exploitation. Within the literature of multi-armed bandit problems, a number of rules for aggregating
base algorithms have been proposed [1, 3, 33], however, the performance of those ‘master’ algorithms
worsens with the number of base algorithms. This prohibits us from directly applying ‘master’
algorithms to the unknown hyperparameter problem, as the length scale is a continuous parameter
and has infinitely many possible values."

LENGTH SCALE,0.023510971786833857,"Within this work, we extend one such aggregation
scheme, called regret-balancing, to handle infinitely
many learners, so that it could tackle the problem of
BO with unknown hyperparameters. We propose an
algorithm called Length scale Balancing GP-UCB
(LB-GP-UCB), which aggregates a number of base
optimisers with different length scale values and grad-
ually introduces new base optimisers, equipped with
smaller length scales. Instead of permanently decreas-
ing the length scale value, as done by A-GP-UCB,
LB-GP-UCB occasionally introduces new base learn-
ers with smaller length scale values, while still main-
taining base learners with longer ones. As such, if
one of the longer length scales is optimal, we will be
able to recover performance close to the one of the
oracle optimiser utilising that optimal length scale.
Denoting the factor by which the regret bound of A-
GP-UCB was away from oracle as g(T), we show
that LB-GP-UCB is only log g(T) away from ora-

our contributions below."

PROBLEM STATEMENT AND PRELIMINARIES,0.06896551724137931,"In order for the bound of Theorem 2.1 to hold, we need to know the length scale θ and an upper
bound on the RKHS norm B of the black-box function for the given kernel kθ. Inspecting the regret
bound together with Proposition 2.2, we see that selecting the smallest B (i.e. the tightest bound) and
the longest length scale θ results in the smallest Rθ,B(T). Note that the same function f(·), can have
different RKHS norms under kernels with different length scale values. As such, to obtain the optimal
scaling of the regret bound, one needs to jointly optimise for θ and B. The optimal hyperparameters
are thus θ⋆, B⋆= arg minθ,B∈R+ Rθ,B(T) such that ∥f∥kθ⋆≤B⋆. We assume we are given some
initial θ0 ≥θ⋆and B0 ≤B⋆. As explained in the introduction, in practice, those initial values could
be found by maximising the marginal likelihood for a small number of initial data points. We now
notice one interesting property. In the case of RBF and ν-Matérn kernels, if we change the length

LENGTH SCALE BALANCING,0.09090909090909091,"Aggregation schemes describe a set of rules that a master algorithm should follow while coordinating
a number of base algorithms. One such scheme is regret-balancing with elimination [33]. This scheme
assumes each of the base algorithms comes with a suspected regret bound, which is a high-probability
bound on its regret that holds if the algorithm is well-specified for the given problem, but might
not hold if the learner is misspecified. The scheme always selects the base algorithm that currently
has the smallest cumulative regret according to its suspected bound. This ensures that the regret of
the master algorithm will not be too far from the regret of the best well-specified candidate. It also
removes base algorithms that underperform, compared to others, by more than their suspected bound,
as this means their bounds do not hold and, with a high probability, are misspecified."

As we can only aggregate a finite number of base algorithms, we thus propose to gradually introduce
new optimisers equipped with new candidate length scale values. Observe that if we stopped our

However, we would like to emphasise that, unlike A-GP-UCB which simply sets its length scale
value to θL(t), we instead introduce new learners with shorter length scale values, while still keeping
the old learners with longer values. This strategy is thus more robust to the choice of the growth
function, which is reflected in better scaling of the regret bound we derive later. In Algorithm 1, we
present LB-GP-UCB, an algorithm employing this mechanism. We now briefly explain the logic

we only need to know the scaling of the bound up to a constant. This rule implies that lower length
scale values will be selected less frequently than higher values, as their regret bounds grow faster.
After that, in line 4, the algorithm utilises the acquisition rule dictated by a model fitted with the
selected length scale value to find the point to query next, xt. The idea is that, occasionally, θt will
be set to one of the smaller values from Θt and, if that results in finding significantly better function
values, then the rejection mechanism in lines 9-12 will remove longer length scales from the set of
considered values, Θt. Otherwise, we will keep all of the length scales and try again after some

As such the bound of our algorithm is significantly closer to the optimal bound than the one of
A-GP-UCB. The faster g(·) is increasing, the quicker we will be able to find the first well-specified
candidate, which will decrease the term t0B⋆in the bound. At the same time, it will increase all
the terms depending on g(T), but as our bound only scales with d log g(T), we are able to select
much more aggressive growth functions than A-GP-UCB, whose bound scales with g(T)d. In the

which we do in Appendix F. In Algorithm 3 we present Length scale and Bound Balancing (LNB) —
an algorithm, which in addition to having candidates for θ also maintains a number of candidates for
N ⋆. As such, it requires us to specify another growth function b(t) for exploring new norm values as
well as the initial RKHS norm B0. We prove its cumulative regret bound in Theorem F.1. We can
similarly derive the suboptimality gap for our algorithm in this case. We display it in Table 1 together
with the gap of A-GP-UCB. We can see that in this setting, we also achieve an improvement."

Experiments"
EXPERIMENTS,0.1865203761755486,"We now evaluate the performance of our algorithm on multiple synthetic and real-world functions.
To run experiments we used the compute resources listed in Appendix I.1 and implemented based
on the codebase of [2], which uses the BoTorch package [5, 34]. We open-source our code2. We
used the UCB acquisition function and we compared different techniques for selecting the length
scale value. For all experiments, we used isotropic ν-Matérn kernel with ν = 2.5. We standardise the
observations before fitting the GP model and as such keep the kernel outputscale fixed to 1.0. The first
baseline we compare against is MLE, where the length scale value is optimised using a multi-start
L-BFGS-B method [25] (the default BoTorch optimiser [5]) after each timestep by maximising the
marginal likelihood for the data collected so far. The next baseline is MCMC, where we employ a
fully Bayesian treatment of the unknown length scale value using the NUTS sampler [19], which
we implemented using Pyro [7]. We use BoTorch’s default hyperprior (θ ∼Γ(3, 6)) and to select a
new point we optimise the expected acquisition function under the posterior samples as described by
[13]. We also compare against A-GP-UCB. To achieve a fair comparison, we used the same growth

in the ablation section. We used 10 initial points for each algorithm unless specified otherwise. To
select upper bound θ0 for A-GP-UCB and LB-GP-UCB we fitted a length scale to initial data points
with MLE (and we did not use MLE after that). We present the results in Figure 3 below. We show

In this problem, we only use three initial points, to benchmark the ability of algorithms to escape
from the local optimum on the right side of the domain. MLE and MCMC can be easily misled
towards too-long length scale values, which causes them to get stuck in the local optimum. Both
A-GP-UCB and LB-GP-UCB quickly find the optimal solution, however, due to over-exploration, the

terms of both cumulative and best regret metrics."

dimensional CrossedBarrel and 5-dimensional AGNP tasks. At each time step, the algorithm can
choose which material configuration to try, and observe the objective value, which corresponds
to a given material optimisation criterion. As material design problems are known to exhibit a
needle-in-a-haystack behaviour [35], on both benchmarks MLE and MCMC get stuck at a suboptimal
solution and their best regret does not fall beyond a certain value. A-GP-UCB is able to quickly
find low-regret solutions on the AGNP benchmark, but struggles on the Crossedbarrel problem and
underperforms in terms of cumulative regret. On the contrary, LB-GP-UCB performs well across
both benchmark problems and across both regret metrics."

sensitive to the selection of growth function g(t), whereas our algorithm selects similar length scale
values regardless of g(t), which results in consistently good best regret results. We can also see that
LB-GP-UCB typically selects values around ˆθ∗for different growth functions, whereas A-GP-UCB
decreases its length scale beyond ˆθ∗, resulting in slower convergence."

Related Work"
RELATED WORK,0.22413793103448276,"We already mentioned the work proposing A-GP-UCB [6], which so far has been the only work
providing the guarantees on BO with unknown hyperparameters, where only an upper bound on the
optimal length scale value is known. The work of [39] addresses the problem, where, in addition, a
lower bound on the optimal length scale is known, however, the regret bound of the algorithm they
propose scales with the γT (kθL) of the smallest possible length scale θL, making it no better than a
naïve algorithm always selecting θL. [8] studied the problem of solving BO, when the kernel function
is misspecified, however, provided no method for finding the well-specified kernel function. [26]
proved a lower bound on the algorithm’s regret in the case when the regularity of RKHS is unknown
(which corresponds to an unknown ν hyperparameter in the case of Matérn kernel), compared to
their work we focused on different unknown hyperparameters, such as the length scale. There
have also been a number of works [13, 21, 27, 32] that tackled the problem of BO with unknown
hyperparameters but did not provide a theoretical analysis of the used algorithm. Some of earlier
works [15, 38] viewed BO with unknown hyperparameters as meta-learning or transfer learning
problem, where a large dataset is available for pre-training. In our problem setting, we do not assume
access to any such pre-training data. Within this work, we considered a frequentist problem setting,
where the black-box function is arbitrarily selected from some RKHS. While there are no guarantees"
RELATED WORK,0.22570532915360503,"for the consistency of MLE in such a setting, if we were to assume a Bayesian setting and put a GP
prior on the black box, statistical literature derived asymptotic consistency results [4, 22, 24, 28] for
MLE of kernel hyperparameters, including length scale. Under such a Bayesian setting, [41] studied
the problem of BO with unknown prior, when we are given a finite number of candidate priors. [10]
derived predictive guarantees for GP in a Bayesian setting with unknown hyperparameters, provided
that hyperpriors on those hyperparameters are known. However, the authors do not provide any BO
algorithm based on their results."

Conclusions"
CONCLUSIONS,0.22884012539184953,"Within this work, we addressed the problem of BO with unknown hyperparameters. We proposed an
algorithm with a cumulative regret bound logarithmically closer to optimal than the previous state of
the art and showed that our algorithm can outperform existing baselines in practice. One limitation of
our work is that we only showed how to handle the isotropic case, i.e. where the same length scale
value is applied for every dimension. This limitation is because our algorithm requires the knowledge
of the regret bounds of an optimiser utilising a given length scale value, which in turn requires the
knowledge of the bounds on MIG γT (kθ) for the used kernel. To the best of our knowledge, within
the existing literature, no work has yet derived those bounds in non-isotropic cases. However, we
believe that if such bounds were obtained, one could easily extend our algorithm to the non-isotropic
case, in the same way as we extended our base algorithm to handle unknown norm and length scale
simultaneously. This constitutes a promising direction of future work."
CONCLUSIONS,0.2304075235109718,"Another limitation of our work is the assumption of known noise magnitude σN. The problem of
simultaneously not knowing kernel hyperparameters and noise magnitude is extremely challenging,
as large variations in observed function values can be a result of either short lengthscale value or
large noise magnitude. To the best of our knowledge, previous work did not tackle this setting and it
remains an open problem."
CONCLUSIONS,0.23197492163009403,"Our algorithm relies on the standard GP model, which can result in poor scalability to large datasets
and high-dimensional spaces. Extending our work to sparse GPs [29, 31] and kernels specifically
designed for a high number of dimensions [14, 42] is another possible direction of future work."

CLAIMS,0.9263322884012539,"Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction contain claims regarding the regret bound of the
algorithm and empirical performance, which are addressed in Sections 4 and 5 respectively.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9278996865203761,"• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.9294670846394985,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Limiations are discussed in the Conclusions section.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9310344827586207,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs"
CLAIMS,0.932601880877743,"Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.9435736677115988,"Justification: We describe what benchmark functions we use as well as provide details on
the baselines and settings of algorithms."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.945141065830721,Guidelines:
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.9467084639498433,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results."
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9482758620689655,5. Open access to data and code
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9498432601880877,"Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide full code by an anonymised link in the Experiments section.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.95141065830721,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9529780564263323,"Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the details on the choice of growth function g(t).
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9545454545454546,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9561128526645768,"Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All plots have shaded areas corresponding to standard errors.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.957680250783699,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9592476489028213,"• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9608150470219435,"Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We list compute resources in the appendix.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9623824451410659,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9639498432601881,"Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper is concerned with foundational research and not tied to any particular
application that can cause ethical concerns.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9655172413793104,"• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9670846394984326,"Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The research presented in the work is foundational and not tied to any particular
application.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9686520376175548,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations."
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9702194357366771,"• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9717868338557993,11. Safeguards
SAFEGUARDS,0.9733542319749217,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?"
SAFEGUARDS,0.9749216300940439,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.9764890282131662,"Justification: The paper is not accompanied by a release of any new data sets or pre-trained
models."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9780564263322884,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9796238244514106,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
