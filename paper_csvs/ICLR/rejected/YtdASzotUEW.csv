ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.00390625,"Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) examples is critical in many applications. We
propose an unsupervised method to detect OOD samples using a k-NN density
estimate with respect to a classiﬁcation model’s intermediate activations on in-
distribution samples. We leverage a recent insight about label smoothing, which
we call the Label Smoothed Embedding Hypothesis, and show that one of the
implications is that the k-NN density estimator performs better as an OOD detection
method both theoretically and empirically when the model is trained with label
smoothing. Finally, we show that our proposal outperforms many OOD baselines
and we also provide new ﬁnite-sample high-probability statistical results for k-NN
density estimation’s ability to detect OOD examples."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01171875,"Identifying out-of-distribution examples has a wide range of applications in machine learning includ-
ing fraud detection in credit cards (Awoyemi et al., 2017) and insurance claims (Bhowmik, 2011),
fault detection and diagnosis in critical systems (Zhao et al., 2013), segmentations in medical imaging
to ﬁnd abnormalities (Prastawa et al., 2004), network intrusion detection (Zhang & Zulkernine, 2006),
patient monitoring and alerting Hauskrecht et al. (2013), counter-terrorism (Skillicorn, 2008) and
anti-money laundering (Labib et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.015625,"Out-of-distribution detection is highly related to the classical line of work in anomaly and outlier
detection. Such methods include density-based (Ester et al., 1996), one-class SVM (Schölkopf
et al., 2001), and isolation forest (Liu et al., 2008). However, these classical methods often aren’t
immediately practical on large and possibly high-dimensional modern datasets."
INTRODUCTION,0.01953125,"More recently, Hendrycks & Gimpel (2016) proposed a simple baseline for detecting out-of-
distribution examples by using a neural network’s softmax predictions, which has motivated many
works since then that leverage deep learning (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2017; Lee
et al., 2017). However, the majority of the works still ultimately use the neural network’s softmax
predictions which suffers from the following weakness. The uncertainty in the softmax function
cannot distinguish between the following situations: (1) the example is actually in-distribution but
there is high uncertainty in its predictions and (2) the example is actually out of distribution. This
is largely because the softmax probabilities sum to 1 and thus must assign the probability weights
accordingly. This has motivated recent explorations in estimating conformal sets for neural networks
(Park et al., 2019; Angelopoulos et al., 2020) which can distinguish between the two cases."
INTRODUCTION,0.0234375,"In this paper, we circumvent the above-mentioned weakness by avoiding using the softmax probabili-
ties altogether. To this end, we approach OOD detection with an alternative paradigm – we leverage
the intermediate embeddings of the neural network and nearest neighbors. Our intuition is backed by
recent work in which the effectiveness of using nearest-neighbor based methods on these embeddings
have been demonstrated on a range of problems such as uncertainty estimation (Jiang et al., 2018),
adversarial robustness (Papernot & McDaniel, 2018), and noisy labels (Bahri et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.02734375,"In this work, we explore using k-NN density estimation to detect OOD examples by computing its
density on the embedding layers. To this end, it’s worth noting that k-NN density estimation is a
unsupervised technique, which makes it very different from the aforementioned deep k-NN work
(Bahri et al., 2020) which leverages the label information of the nearest neighbors. One key intuition"
INTRODUCTION,0.03125,Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
INTRODUCTION,0.03515625,"here is that low k-NN density examples might be OOD candidates as it implies that these examples
are far from the training examples in the embedding space."
INTRODUCTION,0.0390625,"In order for density estimation to be effective on the intermediate embeddings, the data must have
good clusterability (Ackerman & Ben-David, 2009), meaning that examples in the same class should
be close together in distance in the embeddings, while examples not in the same class should be
far apart. While much work has been done for the speciﬁc problem of clustering deep learning
embeddings (Xie et al., 2016a; Hershey et al., 2016) many of these ideas are not applicable to density
estimation."
INTRODUCTION,0.04296875,"In this paper, we use a much simpler but effective approach of label smoothing, which involves
training the neural network on a soft label obtained by taking a weighted average between the original
one-hot encoded label and the uniform distribution over labels. We leverage a key insight about the
effect of label smoothing on the embeddings (Müller et al., 2019): training with label smoothing
has the effect of contracting the intermediate activations of the examples within the same class to be
closer together at a faster rate relative to examples in different classes. This results in embeddings
that have better clusterability. We call this the Label Smoothed Embedding Hypothesis, which we
deﬁne below."
INTRODUCTION,0.046875,"Hypothesis 1 (Label Smoothed Embedding Hypothesis (Müller et al., 2019)). Training with label
smoothing contracts the intermediate embeddings of the examples in a neural network, where
examples within the same class move closer towards each other in distance at a faster rate than
examples in different classes."
INTRODUCTION,0.05078125,"We refer interested readers to Müller et al. (2019) for 2D visualizations of this effect on the model’s
penultimate layer. We will later portray the same phenomenon using k-NN density estimation."
INTRODUCTION,0.0546875,We summarize our contributions as follows:
INTRODUCTION,0.05859375,"(1) We propose a new procedure that uses label smoothing along with aggregating the k-NN density
estimator across various intermediate representations to obtain an OOD score."
INTRODUCTION,0.0625,"(2) We show a number of new theoretical results for the k-NN density estimator in the context of
OOD detection, including guarantees on the recall and precision of identifying OOD examples, the
preservation of the ranking w.r.t. the true density, and a result that provides intuition for why the
Label Smoothed Embedding Hypothesis improves the k-NN based OOD score."
INTRODUCTION,0.06640625,"(3) We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our method and the beneﬁts of label smoothing
on benchmark image classiﬁcation datasets, comparing against recent baselines, including one that
uses k-NN in a different way, as well as classical alternatives to the k-NN but applied in the same
way. The comparison against these ablative models highlight the discriminative power of the k-NN
density estimator for OOD detection."
INTRODUCTION,0.0703125,"(4) We conduct ablations to study the performance impact of the three hyper-parameters of our
method - (1) the amount of label smoothing, (2) which intermediate layers to use, and (3) number of
neighbors k."

ALGORITHM,0.08984375,"When X is implicit, we drop it from the notation for brevity."
ALGORITHM,0.09375,"Our method goes as follows: upon training a classiﬁcation neural network on a sample Xin from some
distribution fin, the intermediate representations of Xin should be close together (in the Euclidean
sense), possibly clustered by class label. Meanwhile, out-of-distribution points should be further away
from the training manifold - that is, rk(gi(xout); Xin) > rk(gi(xin); Xin) for xin ∼fin, xout ∼fout,
where gi maps the input space to the output of the i-th layer of the trained model. Thus, for ﬁxed"

ALGORITHM,0.1015625,"Figure 1: Distributions of the 1-NN radius distance for each of three layers as well as our test statistic,
which aggregates over all layers. “Depth” refers to the layer index with respect to the logits layer.
Thus, 0 means logits, -1 means the layer right before logits, so on and so forth. The ﬁrst two (last
two) columns correspond to the dataset pairing Fashion MNIST →KMNIST (SVHN →CelebA)
with and without label smoothing. The Fashion MNIST pairing uses a 3 layer feedforward neural
network while SVHN uses the convolutional LeNet5. Blue represents samples from the test split of
the dataset used to train the model and are therefore inliers. Red represents the out-of-distribution
samples. Consider the cases of no label smoothing. We see that there is separability between in and
out points at each layer, generally more so at deeper (earlier) layers of the network. This motivates
our use of k-NN distance for OOD detection. There is, however, non-trivial overlap. Now observe
the cases with α = 0.1 smoothing. The 1-NN radii shrink, indicating a “contraction” towards the
training manifold for both in and out-of-distribution points. The contraction is, however, higher for
ID points than for OOD points. This motivates the use of label smoothing in our method."
ALGORITHM,0.10546875,"layer i, we propose the following statistic:"

that in and out-of-distribution points are different distances away from the training points and (2)"

ALGORITHM,0.15234375,"Hypothesis 1, that label smoothing causes in-distribution points to contract to the training points faster
than OOD ones. This provides the grounding for why a statistic based on the k-NN radius using a
label smoothed model is a powerful discriminator. Figure 2 shows the distribution of 1-NN distances
for three layers as well as our proposed aggregate statistic on two dataset pairs. Across layers and
datasets, we see some separability between in and out-of-distributions points. Label smoothing has
the effect of shrinking these distances for both in/out classes but the effect is larger for in points,
making the distributions even more separable and thereby improving the performance of our method."

THEORETICAL RESULTS"
THEORETICAL RESULTS,0.16015625,"In this section, we provide statistical guarantees for using the k-NN radius as a method for out of
distribution detection. To do this, we assume that the features of the data lie on compact support
X ⊂Rd and that examples are drawn i.i.d. from this. We assume that there exists a density function
f : Rd →R corresponding to the distribution of the feature space. This density function can serve as
a proxy for how much an example is out of distribution. The difﬁculty is that this underlying density
function is unknown in practice. Fortunately, we can show that the k-NN radius method approximates
the information conveyed by f based on a ﬁnite sample drawn from f. For the theory, we deﬁne an
out of distribution example as an example where x ̸∈X. Thus, f(x) = 0 for such examples."

OUT OF DISTRIBUTION DETECTION HIGH-RECALL RESULT,0.16796875,"In this section, we give a result about identifying out of distribution examples based on the k-NN
radius with perfect recall if we were to use a particular threshold. That is, any example that is indeed
out of distribution (i.e. has 0 density) will have k-NN radius above that threshold. We also give a
guarantee that the false-positives (i.e. those examples with k-NN radius higher than that quantity
which were not out-of-distribution examples) were of low-density to begin with. Our results hold
with high-probability uniformly across all of Rd. As we will see, as n grows and k/n →0, we ﬁnd
that the k-NN radius method using the speciﬁed threshold is able to identify which examples are
in-distribution vs out-of-distribution."

PERFORMANCE UNDER LABEL SMOOTHING EMBEDDING HYPOTHESIS"
PERFORMANCE UNDER LABEL SMOOTHING EMBEDDING HYPOTHESIS,0.2890625,"In this section, we provide some theoretical intuition behind why the observed label smoothing
embedding hypothesis can lead to better performance for the k-NN density-based approach on
embeddings learned with label smoothing. We make an assumption that our in-distribution has a
convex set X ⊆Rd as its support with uniformly lower bounded density and that applying label
smoothing has the effect of contracting the space Rd in the following way: for points in X the
contraction is with respect to a point of origin x0 in the interior of X so that points in X move closer
to the origin and for outlier points, they move closer to the boundary of X. We ensure that the former
happens at a faster rate than the latter and show the following guarantee, which says that under certain
regularity conditions on the density and X, we have that the ratio of the k-NN distance between an
out-of-distribution point and an in-distribution point increases after this mapping. This suggest that
under such transformations such as ones induced by what’s implied by the label smoothed embedding
hypothesis, the k-NN distance becomes a better score at separating the in-distribution examples from
the out-of-distribution examples."
PERFORMANCE UNDER LABEL SMOOTHING EMBEDDING HYPOTHESIS,0.29296875,"Proposition 1 (Improvement of k-NN OOD with Label Smoothed Embedding Hypothesis). Let f has
convex and bounded support X ⊆Rd and let x0 be an interior point of X and additionally assume
that there exists r0, c0 > 0 such that for all 0 < r < r0 and x ∈X, we have Vol(B(x, r) ∩X) ≤
c0 · Vol(B(x, r)) holds (to ensure that X’s boundaries have regularity and are full dimensional)
and that f(x) ≥λ0 for all x ∈X for some λ0 > 0. Deﬁne mapping φ : Rd →Rd such that
φ(x) = γin · (x −x0) −x0 if x ∈X and otherwise, φ(x) = γout · (x −ProjX (x)) −ProjX (x)
otherwise, for some 0 < γin < γout < 1. (ProjX (x) denotes the projection of x onto the boundary
of convex set X). We see that φ contracts the points where points in X contract at a faster rate than
those outside of X. Suppose our training set consists of n examples X[n] drawn from f, and denote

CelebA (32x32x3) (Liu et al., 2015). In CelebA, we train against the binary label “smiling”. We
train models on the train split of each of these datasets, and then test OOD binary classiﬁcation
performance for a variety of OOD datasets, while always keeping the in-distribution to be the test split
of the dataset used for training. Thus, a dataset pairing denoted “A →B” means that the classiﬁcation
model is trained on A’s train and is evaluated for OOD detection using A’s test as in-distribution
points and B’s test as out-of-distribution points. In addition to the aforementioned, we form OOD
datasets by corrupting the in-distribution test sets - by ﬂipping images left and right (HFlip) as well as
up and down (VFlip) - and we also use the validation split of ImageNet (32x32x3), the test splits of
KMNIST (28x28x1), EMNIST digits (28x28x1), and Omniglot (32x32x3). All datasets are available
as Tensorﬂow Datasets 1. We measure the OOD detectors’ ROC-AUC, sample-weighting to ensure
balance between in and out-of-distribution samples (since they can have different sizes). For MNIST
and Fashion MNIST, we train a 3-layer ReLU-activated DNN, with 256 units per layer, for 20 epochs.
For SVHN, CIFAR10, and CelebA, we train the convolutional LeNet5 (LeCun et al., 2015) for 10
epochs. We use 128 batch size and Adam optimizer with default learning rate 0.001 throughout. All
methods were implemented in TensorFlow and trained on a cloud environment. We estimate we used
a total of 10k CPU hours for all of our experiments. For embedding-based methods, we aggregate
over 3 layers for the DNN and 4 dense layers for LeNet5, including the logits. For our method, we
always use Euclidean distance between embeddings, k = 1 and label smoothing α = 0.1. These
could likely be tuned for better performance in the presence of a validation OOD dataset sufﬁciently
similar to the unknown test set. We do not do this since we assume the absence of such dataset."

Robust Deep k-NN. This method, proposed in Papernot & McDaniel (2018) leverages k-NN for a
query input as follows: it computes the label distribution of the query point’s nearest training points

training example neighbors’ class label distribution. Given that we outperform Robust k-NN more
often than not, we might conjecture that the distance has more discriminative power for OOD
detection than class label distribution. We were surprised that DeConf routinely did worse than the

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.46484375,"Out-of-Distribution Detection.
OOD detection has classically been studied under names such
as outlier, anomaly, or novelty detection. One line of work are density-based methods: Ester et al.
(1996) presents a density-based clustering algorithm which is also an outlier detection algorithm by
identifying noise points which are points whose ϵ-neighborhood has fewer than a certain number
of points. Breunig et al. (2000); Kriegel et al. (2009) propose local outlier scores based on the
degree to which how isolated the datapoint is with respect to its neighborhood via density estimation.
Another line of work uses k-NN density estimates (Ramaswamy et al., 2000; Angiulli & Pizzuti,
2002; Hautamaki et al., 2004; Dang et al., 2015). We use the k-NN density estimator, but use it in
conjunction with the embeddings of a neural network trained with label smoothing. Other classical
approaches include the one-class SVM (Schölkopf et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2001), isolation forest
(Liu et al., 2008). A slew of recent methods have been proposed for OOD. We refer interested readers
to a survey."
RELATED WORK,0.46875,"Label Smoothing.
Label smoothing has received much attention lately; we give a brief review
here. It has been shown to improve model calibration (and therefore the generation quality of auto-
regressive sequence models like machine translation) but has been seen to hurt teacher-to-student
knowledge distillation (Pereyra et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2016b; Chorowski & Jaitly, 2016; Gao et al.,
2020; Lukasik et al., 2020b; Müller et al., 2019). Müller et al. (2019) show visually that label
smoothing encourages the penultimate layer representations of the training examples from the same
class to group in tight clusters. Lukasik et al. (2020a) shows that label smoothing makes models
more robust to label noise in the training data (to a level competitive with noisy label correction
methods), and, furthermore, smoothing the teacher is beneﬁcial when distilling from noisy data.
Chen et al. (2020) corroborates the beneﬁts of smoothing for noisy labels and provides a theoretical
framework wherein the optimal smoothing parameter α can be identiﬁed. LS has been seen to hurt
performance on sparse distributions (Meister et al., 2020) and decrease robustness to adversarial
attacks (Zantedeschi et al., 2017). Yuan et al. (2020) casts knowledge distillation (KD) as a type
of learned label smoothing regularization, showing that part of KD’s success stems from its ability
to regularize soft labels in the same way as LS. They then propose Teacher-free KD that achieves
comparable performance to normal KD with a superior teacher."
RELATED WORK,0.47265625,"k-NN Density Estimation Theory.
Statistical guarantees for k-NN density estimation has had
a long history (Fukunaga & Hostetler, 1973; Devroye & Wagner, 1977; Mack, 1983; Buturovi´c,
1993; Biau et al., 2011; Kung et al., 2012). Most works focus on showing convergence guarantees
under metrics like L2 risk or are asymptotic. Dasgupta & Kpotufe (2014) provided the ﬁrst ﬁnite-
sample uniform rates, which to our knowledge is the strongest result so far. Our analysis uses
similar techniques, which they also borrow from Chaudhuri & Dasgupta (2010); however our results
are for the application of OOD detection whereas Dasgupta & Kpotufe (2014)’s goal was mode
estimation. As a result, our results hold with high probability uniformly in the input space, while
having ﬁnite-sample guarantees and provide new theoretical insights into the use of k-NN for OOD
detection."

corresponding to f and Fn be the empirical distribution corresponding to the sample X. Pick
0 < δ < 1. Assume that k ≥d log n. Then with probability at least 1 −δ, for every ball B ⊂RD we
have"

This is precisely the event in which Lemma 1 holds.
Remark. If δ = 1/n, then Cδ,n = O((log n)3/2)."
