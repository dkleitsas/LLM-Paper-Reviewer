ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.00390625,"There has been great interest in enhancing the robustness of neural network classi-
ﬁers to defend against adversarial perturbations through adversarial training, while
balancing the trade-off between robust accuracy and standard accuracy. We propose
a novel adversarial training framework that learns to reweight the loss associated
with individual training samples based on a notion of class-conditioned margin,
with the goal of improving robust generalization. Inspired by MAML-based ap-
proaches, we formulate weighted adversarial training as a bilevel optimization
problem where the upper-level task corresponds to learning a robust classiﬁer, and
the lower-level task corresponds to learning a parametric function that maps from
a sample’s multi-class margin to an importance weight. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach improves both clean and robust accuracy compared
to related techniques and state-of-the-art baselines."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01171875,"While neural networks have been extremely successful in tasks such as image classiﬁcation and
speech recognition, recent work (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015) has demonstrated that
neural network classiﬁers can be arbitrarily fooled by small, adversarially-chosen perturbations of
their input. Notably, Su et al. (2017) demonstrated that neural network classiﬁers which can correctly
classify “clean” images may be vulnerable to targeted attacks, e.g., misclassify those same images
when only a single pixel is changed."
INTRODUCTION,0.015625,"Recent work has shown a common failing among techniques that uniformly encourage robustness.
In particular, there exists an intrinsic tradeoff between robustness and accuracy (Zhang et al., 2019).
Bao et al. (2020) investigate this tradeoff from the perspective of classiﬁcation-callibrated loss theory.
Rice et al. (2020) empirically showed that during adversarial training, networks often irreversibly
lose robustness after training for a short time. They dubbed this phenomenon adversarial overﬁtting
while proposing early stopping as a remedy. The signiﬁcance of label noise and memorization in the
context of adversarial overﬁtting was demonstrated in Sanyal et al. (2021)—in particular that poor
training samples induce fragility to adversarial perturbations due to the tendency of neural networks
to interpolate the training data. Methods based on weight and logit smoothing have been proposed as
an alternative to early stopping (Chen et al., 2021; Cohen et al., 2019; Salman et al., 2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.01953125,"In another line of work, Geometry-Aware Instance Reweighted Adversarial Training (GAIRAT; Zhang
et al. (2021)), Weighted Margin-aware Minimax Risk (WMMR; Zeng et al. (2021)), and Margin-
Aware Instance reweighting Learning (MAIL; Wang et al. (2021)) were developed to address adver-
sarial overﬁtting by controlling the inﬂuence of training examples via importance / loss weighting.
Intuitively, the samples assigned a low weight correspond to samples on which the classiﬁer is already
sufﬁciently robust. However, existing methods rely on rigid approximations of the margin and employ
heuristic weighting schemes that rely on careful choices of hyperparameters."
INTRODUCTION,0.0234375,"This work builds upon these observations. We present BiLAW (Bilevel Learnable Adversarial
reWeighting), an approach that explicitly learns a parametric function (e.g. represented by a small
feed-forward network) that assigns weights to the loss suffered by a classiﬁer, associated with
individual training samples. The sample weights are learned as a function of the classiﬁer multiclass
margins of the sample, according to the weights’ effect on robust generalization. We employ a
bi-level optimization formulation Bracken & McGill (1973) and leverage a validation set, where
the upper-level objective corresponds to learning the parameters of a robust classiﬁer, while the"

parametric sample weights and updating the classiﬁer network parameters."
INTRODUCTION,0.03515625,"Contributions We note that while sample weighting (Zhang et al., 2021; Yi et al., 2021; Wang et al.,
2021) has been investigated in the context of robust training, as far as we know this is the ﬁrst work
to explore a method to use a validation set to learn weights to induce robust generalization. Our
contributions consist of the following:"
INTRODUCTION,0.0390625,"1. Our approach performs sample re-weighting during training. We propose a bilevel optimiza-
tion formulation to learn a mapping from multi-class margins to weights according to the

INTRODUCTION,0.04296875,"2. We show that when our weighting function corresponds to a neural network, the magnitude
of a sample’s weight directly corresponds to the vulnerability of the classiﬁer at that sample."
INTRODUCTION,0.046875,"3. We evaluate the practical performance of BiLAW on MNIST (LeCun & Cortes, 2010), F-
MNIST (Xiao et al., 2017), CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. (Krizhevsky et al.) and demonstrate
that it improves clean accuracy up to 6% and robust test accuracy by up to 5% compared to
TRADES and other state-of-the-art sample reweighting methods on CIFAR-10."
INTRODUCTION,0.05078125,"This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the notation and background of cost-aware
and robust classiﬁcation. In Section 3 we describe our method in full, including the sample weighting
method. In Section 4, we provide ablative experiments and demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our framework
by comparing clean and robust test performance on MNIST, F-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100
to adversarial training and two recent, state-of-the-art sample weighting methods."

An ReLU network is a neural network such that all nonlinear activations are ReLU

deﬁne σ : Rd →Rd by σ(x) = [σ(x1), . . . , σ(xd)]. Let fθ : Rd →[0, 1]k be a feedforward ReLU
network with l hidden layers and weights θ; for example, f may map from a d-dimensional image to
a k-dimensional vector corresponding to likelihoods for k classes."

machine learning, we are not just concerned that the classiﬁcation be correct, but we also want to
be robust against adversarial examples, i.e. small perturbations to the input which may change the
classiﬁcation to an incorrect class. We deﬁne the notion of ϵ-robustness below:"

ROBUST CLASSIFICATION AND ADVERSARIAL OVERFITTING,0.09375,"Note that the ϵ-robustness of fθ at x is intimately related to the uniform and local Lipschitz smoothness
of fθ around x. Recall that a function f has ﬁnite, global Lipschitz constant L > 0 with respect to

ROBUST CLASSIFICATION AND ADVERSARIAL OVERFITTING,0.09765625,"An immediate consequence of Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 is that if fθ is uniformly L-Lipschitz, then fθ is ϵ-robust

likelihood of the second most likely outcome (Salman et al., 2019). The piecewise linearity of ReLU
networks facilitates the extension of this consequence to the locally Lipschitz regime. L corresponds
to the norm of the afﬁne map characterized by f conditioned on input x. These properties were
previously used to characterize the robustness of a network at a sample (and the weight associated

that associated samples lie far from the decision boundary, and are therefore more robust, requiring
smaller weights. However, due to the non-linearity of the loss-surface in practice, PGD-based attacks
with ﬁnite iterations may suffer from the same issues that plague standard iterative ﬁrst-order methods
in non-convex settings. In other words, κ is heavily dependent on the optimization path taken by PGD.
This is demonstrated by GAIRAT’s vulnerability on sophisticated attacks, e.g. AutoAttack (Croce &

similarly to GAIRAT’s κ, even for samples very close to the decision boundary, simple functions of
the difference between class likelihoods may not necessarily correspond to the true distance to the
decision boundary. Here we propose a more ﬁne-grained notion of margin, the multi-class margin,
and design a method to learn a mapping between the margin at a sample and its associated weight."
MARGIN-AWARE REWEIGHTING,0.171875,"Previous work has explored theoretical notions of a multi-class margin. For example, Zou (2005)
deﬁned the margin vector in the context of boosting as a proxy for a vector of conditional class
probabilities. However, this notion of margin is unaware of the true class of a sample. In contrast,
the multi-class margin proposed by Saberian & Vasconcelos (2019); Cortes et al. (2013) are both
closely related to Wang et al. (2021); Zeng et al. (2021), i.e. deﬁned as the minimal distance between

notions of margin reasonably assume that samples at which a classiﬁer is vulnerable have small
margin according to Def. 2, i.e. the magnitude of the smallest difference between the logits of any
class and the logit corresponding the true class is small. However, we demonstrate in Fig. 1(b) for
both vulnerable and robust classiﬁers that while the majority of predictions made by networks on
adversarial samples do correspond to the classes with minimal margin, a signiﬁcant number do not. In
other words, the class for which the margin is smallest does not always correspond to the adversarial
class. Furthermore, this issue is exacerbated for robust networks as shown by the difference in count
distribution between networks whose relative robustness varies."

adoption by the machine learning community—in particular in the context of hyperparameter tuning
(Jenni & Favaro, 2018; Ren et al., 2018) and meta-learning (Finn et al., 2017; Rajeswaran et al.,

novelties in our new learning scheme compared to existing robust training methods: First, we consider
a more reasonable assumption leveraging the concept of multi-class margin in robust training, where
good weights should be aware of both the margin associated with each class, as well as the true
class associated with the sample. Second, as opposed to related work which deﬁnes an explicit
formula for the weights dependent on the margin, we propose to learn the weights as part of training
the classiﬁcation model. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the weights as a function of a multi-class margin,
and parameterize this function using a small auxiliary network. We formulate this as a bi-level
optimization problem and learn the weights iteratively alongside the neural network parameters."

(AT) (Madry et al., 2018), GAIRAT (Zhang et al., 2021), WMMR (Zeng et al., 2021), and

our approach and variants, two validation sets of size 1000 are extracted from the training set: one is
used to learn the auxiliary network parameters, and the second is used for early stopping. This results
in a smaller training set for BiLAW, while the training sets of competing methods are unaltered."
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION,0.5,"In Table 1, we evaluate BiLAW using two relatively small networks on two datasets: MNIST (LeCun

2 convolutional and 2 dense layers. FC1 corresponds to a single hidden layer feedforward network
with 1024 hidden units. The details of the architectures are given in the Appendix. We consider
robustness with respect to ℓ∞distance. We use three criteria: clean test accuracy (clean), robust test
accuracy (PGD) for a given threshold ϵ and AutoAttack (AA). Robust test accuracy is computed
using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) (Madry et al., 2018) with 20 iterations. In all testcases, our
method matches the performance of GAIRAT and out-performs the other methods for clean and PGD
accuracy and we out-perform all reweighting methods on AA accuracy. However, we note the overall
distribution of both clean and robust accuracy is tight. We note a potential drawback of reweighting"

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION,0.53515625,"In Table 2, we evaluate our method using the two architec-
tures used in Zhang et al. (2021) on CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky
et al.): a 6-layer convolutional network and a Wide-Resnet-
10-32 (WRN-32-10) (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016),
with details provided in the Appendix.
We run each
method for 100 epochs with training and validation batch
sizes set to 128 using SGD + momentum. A standard learn-
ing rate schedule is implemented with the initial learning
rate of 0.1 divided by 10 at Epoch 30 and 60, respectively.
BiLAW strictly outperforms AT with respect to both clean
and robust accuracy and generally outperforms GAIRAT
and WMMR with respect to clean and robust accuracy on
CIFAR-10 (up to 10%). In particular, BiLAW consistently
achieves superior clean test accuracy in all testcases, ex-
cept for the ℓ∞small-CNN (ϵ = 0.031). On the WRN ℓ∞
case, we maintain and outperform relevant methods with respect to both PGD-based and AA-based
robust accuracy while achieving superior clean test accuracy. We demonstrate that when used in
conjunction with TRADES, BiLAW preserves and improves robustness to AA attacks by 1.5% in
contrast to TRADES, while signiﬁcantly enhancing clean test accuracy by up to 3% and PGD attacks
by up to 5%. We also note that parametric reweighting as opposed to the non-parametric version
signiﬁcantly improves robust accuracy. On CIFAR-100 (Table 3) BiLAW-TRADES out-performs all
other methods. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of using a held-out validation set to learn
the sample weights compared to heuristic reweighting schemes."

TRAINING SAMPLE WEIGHTS"
TRAINING SAMPLE WEIGHTS,0.55078125,"We investigate the correspondence between weights and samples, and ask the question: what are the
properties of training examples with high/low weights? Fig. 3 provides evidence that supports our
claim that samples for which the auxiliary network predicts high weights correspond to vulnerable, or
difﬁcult samples close to the decision boundary. In Fig. 3(a)-(b), we plot the distribution of weights
for each class, as well the associated confusion matrix of predictions made by a robust classiﬁer
(trained with BiLAW) on adversarial samples. We note that the distribution of weights matches the
distribution of misclassiﬁed adversarial examples. For example, in Fig. 3(a), samples of the ‘ship’ and
‘automobile’ class are assigned a higher number of smaller weights and they are typically classiﬁed
correctly as in Fig. 3b. In contrast, birds, cats, and other animals have a higher number of samples
assigned large weight and are more frequently misclassiﬁed. (c)"

matrix of a robust network on CIFAR-10. (c) “Easy” CIFAR-10 samples with low weight are correctly
classiﬁed. (d) “Hard” CIFAR-10 samples with high weight are typically incorrectly classiﬁed."
TRAINING SAMPLE WEIGHTS,0.5625,"In Fig. 3(c), we provide several examples of test samples that are assigned low weight. These images
are typically very clear, involving a centered object and plain background. In Fig. 3(d), we provide
a set of test samples assigned high weights. Many of these images are challenging for humans to
identify, even when uncorrupted by adversarial noise. For example, the second and ﬁfth image
are pictures of cats and birds with unusual pose. The seventh, eighth, and ninth image are nearly
impossible to identify due to complex backgrounds or obscured objects. Additionally, the second,
third, eighth, and tenth images consist of multiple objects that could confuse the network or facilitate
more effective adversarial attacks. Thus, high weights can be used to identify adversarially vulnerable
samples, and automatically differentiate easy and challenging samples in existing datasets."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5703125,"We have introduced BiLAW, a new robust training method that learns classiﬁers that are robust to
norm-bounded adversarial attacks and is inspired by the hypothesis that reweighting via bilevel opti-
mization offers a remedy to the issue of adversarial overﬁtting. We demonstrate that our method learns
robust networks that out-performs competing methods,including related, geometrically-motivated
techniques. Notably, BiLAW does not rely on complicated heuristics to assign weights, and we
demonstrate the learned weights are interpretable. Future work involves improving scalability and
investigating whether the auxiliary network might be used to detect adversarial corruptions."

CIFAR-10 EXAMPLE WEIGHTS"
REFERENCES,0.9296875,"In Fig 4 we recover the predictions made by a small-CNN trained with BiLAW. We then use principal
component analysis (PCA) to project 10-dimensional predicted class likelihoods into 2-dimensions
and plot the corresponding embeddings. The color denotes the degree of the robustness of each
data point. Samples which are assigned larger weight are darker. As expected, these samples
associated with high weights lie close to the decision boundary and are more likely to improve robust
generalization."
REFERENCES,0.93359375,"In Fig 5 we investigate the dynamics of predicted weights by visualizing the progression of weights
predicted at margins for training samples and their adversarial variants. We observe (1) the dynamics
of the weights seem to be determined largely by the learning rate of the classiﬁer (i.e. the ﬁrst
adjustment to the learning rate happens around epoch 20), (2) the majority of weights predicted
for clean samples are low (i.e. most clean samples are easy), and (3) the variance of the weight
distribution is quite tight for adversarial samples."
REFERENCES,0.9375,"In Fig 6 we compare weights computed via the GAIRAT and MAIL heuristics to weights predicted
via BiLAW and show a positive correlation. In particular, BiLAW may be considered a generalization
of the MAIL heuristic that additionally incorporates multi-class margin information. The similar-
ity between margin-based weight estimators BiLAW and MAIL is evident, while the PGD-based
GAIRAT weighting heuristic emphasizes a bimodal weight distribution."
