ABSTRACT,0.002890173410404624,"Many machine learning tasks involve learning functions that are known to be
invariant or equivariant to certain symmetries of the input data. However, it is often
challenging to design neural network architectures that respect these symmetries
while being expressive and computationally efﬁcient. For example, Euclidean
motion invariant/equivariant graph or point cloud neural networks.
We introduce Frame Averaging (FA), a general purpose and systematic framework
for adapting known (backbone) architectures to become invariant or equivariant to
new symmetry types. Our framework builds on the well known group averaging
operator that guarantees invariance or equivariance but is intractable. In contrast,
we observe that for many important classes of symmetries, this operator can be
replaced with an averaging operator over a small subset of the group elements,
called a frame. We show that averaging over a frame guarantees exact invariance
or equivariance while often being much simpler to compute than averaging over
the entire group. Furthermore, we prove that FA-based models have maximal
expressive power in a broad setting and in general preserve the expressive power
of their backbone architectures. Using frame averaging, we propose a new class
of universal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), universal Euclidean motion invari-
ant point cloud networks, and Euclidean motion invariant Message Passing (MP)
GNNs. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FA on several applications in-
cluding point cloud normal estimation, beyond 2-WL graph separation, and n-body
dynamics prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results in all of these benchmarks."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.008670520231213872,"Many tasks in machine learning (ML) require learning functions that are invariant or equivariant
with respect to symmetric transformations of the data. For example, graph classiﬁcation is invariant
to a permutation of its nodes, while node prediction tasks are equivariant to node permutations.
Consequently, it is important to design expressive neural network architectures that are by construction
invariant or equivariant for scalable and efﬁcient learning. This recipe has proven to be successful
for many ML tasks including image classiﬁcation and segmentation (LeCun et al., 1998; Long et al.,
2015), set and point-cloud learning (Zaheer et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2017a), and graph learning (Kipf &
Welling, 2016; Gilmer et al., 2017; Battaglia et al., 2018)."
INTRODUCTION,0.011560693641618497,"Nevertheless, for some important instances of symmetries, the design of invariant and/or equivariant
networks is either illusive (Thomas et al., 2018; Dym & Maron, 2020), computationally expensive
or lacking in expressivity (Xu et al., 2018a; Morris et al., 2019; Maron et al., 2019; Murphy et al.,
2019). In this paper, we propose a new general-purpose framework, called Frame Averaging (FA),
that can systematically facilitate expressive invariant and equivariant networks with respect to a broad
class of groups. At the heart of our framework, we build on a basic fact that arbitrary functions
φ ∶V →R, Φ ∶V →W, where V,W are some vector spaces, can be made invariant or equivariant by
symmetrization, that is averaging over the group (Yarotsky, 2021; Murphy et al., 2018), i.e.,"

INTRODUCTION,0.028901734104046242,"where G = {g} denotes the group, ψ ∶V →R is invariant and Ψ ∶V →W is equivariant with
respect to G. Furthermore, since invariant and equivariant functions are ﬁxed under group averaging,
i.e., ψ = φ for invariant φ and Ψ = Φ for equivariant Φ, the above scheme often leads to universal
(i.e., maximally expressive) models (Yarotsky, 2021). However, the challenge with equation 1 is
that when the cardinality of G is large (e.g., combinatorial groups such as permutations) or inﬁnite
(e.g., continuous groups such as rotations), then exact averaging is intractable. In such cases, we
are forced to approximate the sum via heuristics or Monte Carlo (MC), thereby sacriﬁcing the exact
invariance/equivariance property for computational efﬁciency, e.g., Murphy et al. (2018; 2019) deﬁne
heuristic averaging strategies for approximate permutation invariance in GNNs; similarly, Hu et al.
(2021) and Shuaibi et al. (2021) use MC averaging for approximate rotation equivariance in GNNs.
A concurrent approach is to ﬁnd cases where computing the symmetrization operator can be done
more efﬁciently (Sannai et al., 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.031791907514450865,"The key observation of the current paper is that the group average in equation 1 can be replaced with an
average over a carefully selected subset F(X) ⊂G while retaining both exact invariance/equivariance
and expressive power. Therefore, if F can be chosen so that the cardinality ∣F(X)∣is mostly small,
averaging over F(X) results in both expressive and efﬁcient invariant/equivariant model. We call
the set-valued function F ∶V →2G, a frame, and show that it can successfully replace full group
averaging if it satisﬁes a set equivariance property. We name this framework Frame Averaging (FA)
and it serves as the basis for the design of invariant/equivariant networks in this paper."
INTRODUCTION,0.03468208092485549,"We instantiate the FA framework by considering different choices of symmetry groups G, their
actions on data spaces V,W (manifested by choices of group representations), and the backbone
architectures (or part thereof) φ,Φ we want to make invariant/equivariant to G. We consider: (i) Multi-
Layer Perceptrons (MLP), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node identiﬁcation (Murphy
et al., 2019; Loukas, 2020) adapted to permutation invariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs); (ii)
Message-Passing GNN (Gilmer et al., 2017) adapted to be invariant/equivariant to Euclidean motions,
E(d); (iii) Set network, DeepSets and PointNet (Zaheer et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2017a) adapted to be
equivariant or locally equivariant to E(d); (iv) Point cloud network, DGCNN (Wang et al., 2018),
adapted to be equivariant to E(d)."
INTRODUCTION,0.03757225433526012,"Theoretically, we prove that the FA framework maintains the expressive power of its original backbone
architecture which leads to some interesting corollaries: First, (i) results in invariant universal graph
learning models; (ii) is an E(d) invariant/equivariant GNN that maintain the power of message
passing (Xu et al., 2018a; Morris et al., 2019); and (iii), (iv) furnish a universal permutation and
E(d) invariant/equivariant models. We note that both the construction and the proofs are arguably
considerably simpler than the existing alternative constructions and proofs for this type of symmetry
(Thomas et al., 2018; Fuchs et al., 2020; Dym & Maron, 2020). We experimented with FA on different
tasks involving symmetries including: point-cloud normal estimation, beyond 2-Weisfeiler-Lehman
graph separation, and n-body dynamics predictions, reaching state of the art performance in all."

FRAME AVERAGING FOR FUNCTION SYMMETRIZATION,0.08092485549132948,"Several comments are in order: First, the invariant case (equation 2) is a particular case of the
equivariant case (equation 3) under the choice of W = R and the trivial representation ρ2(g) ≡1.
Second, in this paper we only consider X and frame choices F for which F(X) are ﬁnite sets.
Nevertheless, treating the inﬁnite case is an important future research direction. Third, a trivial choice
of an equivariant frame is F(X) ≡G, that is, taking the frame to be the entire group for all X ∈V
(for inﬁnite but compact G the sum in the FA in this case can be replaced with Harr integral). This
choice can be readily checked to be equivariant, and turns the FA equations 2, 3 into standard group
averaging operators, equation 1. The problem with this choice, however, is that it often results in an
intractable or challenging computation, e.g., when the group is large or inﬁnite. In contrast, as we
show below, in some useful cases one can compute a manageable size frame and can use it to build
invariant or equivariant operators in a principled way. Let us provide a simple example for Frame
Averaging: consider V = Rn, W = R, and G = R with addition as the group action. We choose the
group actions1 in this case to be ρ1(a)x = x + a1, and ρ2(a)b = b + a, where a,b ∈R, x ∈Rn, and
1 ∈Rn is the vector of all ones. We can deﬁne the frame in this case using the averaging operator

An important use case of frame averaging is with the
backbones φ,Φ already invariant/equivariant w.r.t. some symmetry group H and our goal is to
make it invariant/equivariant to H × G. For example, say we want to add G = E(3) equivariance to
permutation invariant set or graph functions, i.e., H = Sn. We will provide sufﬁcient conditions for the
FA to provide this desired invariance/equivariance. First, let us assume H is acting on V and W by the
representations τ1 ∶H →GL(V ) and τ2 ∶H →GL(W), respectively. Assume φ is H invariant and
Φ is H equivariant. We say that representations ρ1 and τ1 commute if ρ1(g)τ1(h)X = τ1(h)ρ1(g)X
for all g ∈G, h ∈H, and X ∈V . If ρ1 and τ1 commute then the map γ1 ∶H ×G →GL(V ) deﬁned by
γ1(h,g) = τ1(h)ρ1(g) is a representation of the group H ×G. Second, we would need that the frame

There could be instances of the FA framework
(indeed we discuss such a case later) where ∣F(X)∣is still too large to evaluate equations 2,3. In
the invariant case, there is a more efﬁcient form of FA, that can potentially be applied. To show
it, let us start by deﬁning the subgroup of symmetries of X, i.e., its stabilizer. The stabilizer of an
element X ∈V is a subgroup of G deﬁned by GX = {g ∈G ∣ρ1(g)X = X}. GX naturally induces an
equivalence relation ∼on F(X), with g ∼h ⇐⇒hg−1 ∈GX. The equivalence classes (orbits) are
[g] = {h ∈F(X)∣g ∼h} = GXg ⊂F(X), for g ∈F(X), and the quotient set is denoted F(X)/GX.

Therefore, there could be cases, such as when X describes a symmetric graph, where ∣F(X)∣could
be too large to average over. A remedy comes from the following observation: for every h ∈[g], we
have that h = rg, r ∈GX, and φ(ρ1(h)−1X) = φ(ρ1(g)−1ρ1(r)−1X) = φ(ρ1(g)−1X), since also
r−1 ∈GX. Therefore the summands in equations 2 are constant over orbits, and we get"

⟨Φ3,3⟩F, yielding a universal, E(3) equivariant versions for PointNet and DGCNN, dubbed FA-
PointNet and FA-DGCNN. A more complex design choice, taking inspiration from deep architectures
with multiple modules, is to compose blocks of FA networks. For example, to build a local E(3)
equivariant version of PointNet, denote also Υd,d′ ∶Rd →Rd′ an MLP. We decompose the input
point cloud to k-nn patches Xi ∈Rk×3, i ∈[n], where each patch is sorted by distance. Next, feed
each patch into an equivariant FA Υ3k,3d, each with its own frame Fi, resulting in E(3) equivariant

State of the art Sn invariant networks, e.g.,
(Qi et al., 2017a;b; Atzmon et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018b; Wang et al., 2018) are not
invariant/equivariant to rotations/reﬂections by construction (Chen et al., 2019). Invariance to global
or local rotations can be achieved by modifying the 3D convolution operator or modifying the input
representation. Relative angles and distances across points (Deng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) or
angles and distances w.r.t. normals (Gojcic et al., 2019) can be used for rotation invariance. Other
works use some local or global frames to achieve invariance to rotations and translations. Xiao et al.
(2020); Yu et al. (2020); Deng et al. (2018) also use PCA to deﬁne rotation invariance, and can be
seen as instances of the FA framework. We augment this line of work by introducing a more general
framework that includes equivariance to rotation/reﬂection and translation, more general architectures
and symmetries as well as theoretical analysis of the expressive power of such models.
Equivariance is a desirable property for 3D recognition, registration (Ao et al., 2021), and other
domains such as complex physical systems (Kondor, 2018). A popular line of work utilizes the
theory of spherical harmonics to achieve equivariance (Worrall et al., 2017; Esteves et al., 2018;
Liu et al., 2018; Weiler et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2018). Notably, Tensor Field Networks (TFN),
SE(3) transformers, and Group-Equivariant Attention (Thomas et al., 2018; Fuchs et al., 2020;
Romero & Cordonnier, 2021) achieve equivariance to both translation and rotation, i.e., SE(3),
and are maximally expressive (i.e., universal) as shown in Dym & Maron (2020). These methods,
however, are speciﬁcally adapted to SE(3) and require high order SO(3) representations as features.
Recently Deng et al. (2021) propose a rotation equivariant network by introducing tensor features,
linear layers that act equivariantly on them and equivariant non-linearities etc. However, their
architecture is not proved to be universal. Discrete convolutions (Cohen et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019;
Worrall & Brostow, 2018) have also been used for achieving equivariance. In particular, Chen et al.
(2021) propose point networks that are SE(3) equivariant and use separable discrete convolutions.
Lastly, (Finzi et al., 2020) construct equivariant layers using local group convolution, and extends
beyond rotations to any Lie group.
Graph neural networks. Message passing (MP) GNNs (Gilmer et al., 2017) are designed to be Sn
equivariant. Kondor et al. (2018) introduces a broader set of equivariant operators in MP-GNNs, while
Maron et al. (2018) provides a full characterization of linear permutation invariant/equivariant GNN
layers. In a parallel approach, trying to avoid harming expressively due to restricted architectures (Xu
et al., 2018a; Morris et al., 2019), other works suggested symmetrization of non invariant/equivariant
backbones. Ranging from eliminating all symmetries by a canonical ordering (Niepert et al., 2016) to
averaging over the entire symmetry group (Murphy et al., 2019; 2018), which amount to the trivial
frame F ≡ρ(G), with the symmetry group G = Sn. As we have also shown, this approach comes at
a cost of high variance approximations hindering the learning process. Our FA framework reduces
the variance both by choosing a canonical ordering and addressing the fact that it may not be unique."

training and testing on the original data; ii) I/SO(3) - training on the original data and testing on
randomly rotated data; and iii) SO(3)/SO(3) - training and testing with randomly rotated data. We
used the ABC dataset (Koch et al., 2019) that contains 3 collections (10k, 50k, and 100k models
each) of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models. We follow the protocol of the benchmark suggested
in Koch et al. (2019), and quantitatively measure normal estimation quality via 1 −(nT ˆn)2, with n
being the ground truth normal and ˆn the normal prediction. We used the same random train/test splits

In addition, we also compare to VN-PointNet and VN-DGCNN (Deng et al., 2021), a recent state of

Table 1 showcase the advantages of our FA framework: Incorporating FA to existing architectures
is beneﬁcial in scenarios (ii-iii), outperforming augmentation by a large margin. In contrast to VN

bone) neural architectures to be invariant/equivariant to desired symmetries that appear in the data.
We prove the method preserves the expressive power of the backbone model, and is efﬁcient to

networks that are invariant/equivariant to Euclidean motions E(3), and GNNs invariant/equivariant
to Euclidean motions E(3). We empirically validate the effectiveness of these models on several
invariant/equivariant learning tasks. We believe the instantiations presented in the paper are only the
ﬁrst step in exploring the full potential of the FA framework, and there are many other symmetries
and scenarios that can beneﬁt from FA. For example, extending the invariance (or equivariance) of
a model from a subgroup H of G, to G. Further Interesting open questions, not answered by this

effects the learning process? How to explore useful FA architectures and modules?"

PROOF OF THEOREM 3 AND COROLLARY 1"
REFERENCES,0.684971098265896,"Proof. (Theorem 3) First we show GX acts on F(X). For an arbitrary h ∈GX and equivariant
frame F, we have F(X) = F(ρ1(h)X) = hF(X), where in the ﬁrst equality we used the fact that
h ∈GX and in the second the equivariance of F. This means that if g ∈F(X) and h ∈GX then also
hg ∈F(X), or in other words F(X) is closed to actions from GX. Furthermore, since a group acts
on itself via bijections we have that the cardinality of all orbits is the same, ∣[g]∣= ∣GXg∣= ∣GX∣, for

THE ROLE OF mF IN APPROXIMATION QUALITY OF EQUATION 7"
REFERENCES,0.6936416184971098,"To better understand the role of mF in approximating equation 6 we ﬁrst note that equation 7 can

ρ1(gh)ρ1(h)−1S(X) = ρ1(gh)S(ρ1(h)−1X) is sorted and we get that gh ∈F(ρ1(h)−1X). We

a fair comparison with the baselines (Satorras et al., 2021). The functions φe and φh are implemented
as a two-layer MLP with the SiLU activation function (also chosen for consistency purposes) with
an hidden dimension of 121 and 120 respectively. To maintain fair comparison with (Satorras et al.,
2021) our network is composed of 4 GNN layers. Φ
(1)
6,3d′ has an additional linear embedding of
the features as a preﬁx to the GNN layers while Φ
(4)
3d′,3 is equipped with a two-layer MLP (SiLU
activation) as a decoder to extract ﬁnal positions."

We followed the protocol from (Satorras et al., 2021) and trained our model with
batch size 100 for 10000 epochs. The learning rate was set to 0.001 and did not changed during
training. For optimization we used the ADAM optimizer. Training was done on a single Nvidia
RTX-6000 GPU, using PYTORCH deep learning framework."
