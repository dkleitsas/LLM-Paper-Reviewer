ABSTRACT,0.004608294930875576,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.009216589861751152,"Recent advances in self-supervised learning have experienced remarkable progress,
especially for contrastive learning based methods, which regard each image as well
as its augmentations as an individual class and try to distinguish them from all other
images. However, due to the large quantity of exemplars, this kind of pretext task
intrinsically suffers from slow convergence and is hard for optimization. This is
especially true for small scale models, which we ﬁnd the performance drops dramat-
ically comparing with its supervised counterpart. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective distillation strategy for unsupervised learning. The highlight is that
the relationship among similar samples counts and can be seamlessly transferred
to the student to boost the performance. Our method, termed as BINGO, which
is short for Bag of InstaNces aGgregatiOn, targets at transferring the relationship
learned by the teacher to the student. Here bag of instances indicates a set of similar
samples constructed by the teacher and are grouped within a bag, and the goal of
distillation is to aggregate compact representations over the student with respect to
instances in a bag. Notably, BINGO achieves new state-of-the-art performance on
small scale models, i.e., 65.5% and 68.9% top-1 accuracies with linear evaluation
on ImageNet, using ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 as backbone, respectively, surpass-
ing baselines (52.5% and 57.4% top-1 accuracies) by a signiﬁcant margin. The
code is available at https://github.com/haohang96/bingo."

success. Most current self-supervised methods yet focus on networks with large size, e.g., ResNet-

INTRODUCTION,0.10138248847926268,"Compress (Fang et al., 2020) and SEED (Fang et al., 2020) are two typical methods for unsupervised
distillation, which propose to transfer knowledge from the teacher in terms of similarity distributions
among different instances. However, as the similarity distribution is computed by randomly sampling
instances from a dynamically maintained queue, this kind of knowledge is mostly constructed based
on instances with low relation, which fails to effectively model similarity of those highly related
samples. To solve this issue, we propose a new self-supervised distillation method, which transfers
knowledge by aggregating bags of related instances, named BINGO. In our empirical studies,
transferring knowledge based on highly related samples helps boost performance more effectively
compared with previous relation-agnostic methods. Speciﬁcally, we select an unsupervised pretrained
large model as the teacher. First, we map the conventional instance-wise dataset into a bag-wise
one. Each original instance is set as an anchor instance of the bag. By matching similarities of
all the other instances’ embeddings produced by the teacher model, we feed instances which show
high similarity with the anchor instance into the bag. Then we apply the bagged dataset to the
small model distillation process. To this end, we propose a bag-aggregation distillation loss, which
consists of two components: inter-sample distillation and intra-sample distillation. For intra-sample
distillation, embeddings of the student and teacher from two augmentations of the same instance are
pushed together; for inter-sample distillation, embeddings of all instances in one bag are pushed to be
more similar with the anchor one. Equipped with the two proposed distillation loss, the bag-based
knowledge from the teacher can be well transferred to the student, which shows signiﬁcant advantages
over previous relation-agnostic ones (Fang et al., 2020; Abbasi Koohpayegani et al., 2020)."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.1336405529953917,"Self-supervised Learning
As a generic framework to learn representations with unlabeled data,
self-supervised learning has experienced remarkable progress over the past few years. By constructing
a series of pretext tasks, self-supervised learning aims at extracting discriminative representations
from input data. Previous methods obtain self-supervised representations mainly via a corrupting
and recovering manner, from perspectives of spatial ordering (Noroozi & Favaro, 2016), rotation
changes (Komodakis & Gidaris, 2018), in-painting (Pathak et al., 2016), or colorization (Zhang et al.,
2016), et al. Recently, contrastive learning based methods (He et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020a) emerge
and signiﬁcantly promote the performance of self-supervised learning, which aim at maximizing the
mutual information between two augmented views of a image. A series of subsequent works (Grill
et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020b; Dwibedi et al., 2021) further improve the performance to a very high
level. Khosla et al. (2020) applies contrastive learning on supervised learning, which selects the
positive samples from the same category. Caron et al. (2020) proposes to align the distribution of one
instance’s different views on other categories. However, few of them pay attention to self-supervised
learning on small-scale models, which are of critical importance to implement self-supervised models
on lightweight devices. We propose an effective method to boost the self-supervised learning of
small models, which takes advantage of relation-based knowledge between data and shows superior
performance than previous ones."
RELATED WORK,0.1382488479262673,"Knowledge Distillation
Knowledge distillation aims to transfer knowledge from a model (teacher)
to another one (student), usually from a large to small one, which is commonly used for improving
the performance of the lightweight model. Hinton et al. (2015) ﬁrst proposes knowledge distillation
via minimizing the KL-divergence between the student and teacher’s logits, which uses the predicted
class probabilities from the teacher as soft labels to guide the student model. Instead of mimicking
teacher’s logits, Romero et al. (2014) transfers the knowledge by minimizing the ℓ2 distance between
intermediate outputs of the teacher and student model. To solve the dimension mismatch, Romero
et al. (2014) uses a randomly initialized projection layer to enlarge the dimension of a narrower
student model. Based on Romero et al. (2014), Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016) utilizes knowledge
stored in the attention map generated by the teacher model, and pushes the student model to pay
attention to the area where the teacher focuses on. Zhou et al. (2021) improves weighted soft labels to
adaptively improve the bias-variance tradeoff of each sample. Besides perspectives of soft labels and
intermediate features, relation between samples is also an important knowledge. Park et al. (2019)
and Liu et al. (2019) train student model by aligning the pair-wise similarity graph with the teacher.
Recently, some works extend the above distillation method into self-supervised learning scenarios.
Tian et al. (2019) uses the contrastive loss to learn cross-modality consistency. Xu et al. (2020a),Fang
et al. (2020) and Abbasi Koohpayegani et al. (2020) share a similar methodology with Caron et al.
(2020) of aligning feature distribution between views of the same instances. The distribution is
computed as the pair-wise similarities between student’s outputs and features stored in memory bank.
However, the above relation-based self-supervised distillation methods only compute the similarity
between anchor sample and randomly sampled instances from a maintained queue, which ignores
the relation between sampled and anchor instances. Choi et al. (2021) uses the teacher model to
produce cluster assignments, and encourages the student model to mimic the output of the trainable
teacher model on-the-ﬂy, which achieves promising results. Gao et al. (2021) strengthens the student
model by adding a regularization loss on the original contrastive loss, which aims at minimizing the
ℓ2 distance between the student’s and teacher’s embedding. Navaneet et al. (2021) also achieves
competitive results with feature regression in self-supervised distillation. We propose to transfer
the relation knowledge between models via a new type of dataset, which bags related instances. By
aggregating the bagged instances, the relation knowledge can be effectively transferred."

et al. (2020); Abbasi Koohpayegani et al. (2020); Fang

venient comparisons with other methods, we report
the validation accuracy with 10 NN (we use the stu-
dent model distilled from ResNet-50×2). As shown
in Table 1, BINGO achieves 61.0% and 64.9% accu-

whether to load the teacher model parameters into the teacher part in Fig. 2; data relation refers to the
Linter loss. Besides, Lintra is intrinsically a basic contrastive-learning paradigm on two views of
one instance. no matter the teacher’s parameters are loaded or not, using the the data relation from
pretrained teacher model always gets better results than using data relation from online student model,
which veriﬁes the efﬁciency of transferring teacher’s data relation to student model. Interestingly,

v2 (Chen et al., 2020c). As for DisCo (Gao et al., 2021), the computational complexity is also
increased due to the multiple forward propagation for one sample: once for the mean student, twice
for the online student and twice for the teacher model. The total number of forward propagation is 5,
2.5× bigger than SEED and MoCo-v2. For the above analysis, BINGO has a similar computation
cost with DisCo. To compare with SEED and DisCo under the same cost, we distill ResNet-34 from

CONCLUSIONS,0.6405529953917051,"This paper proposes a new self-supervised distillation method, named BINGO, which bags related
instances by matching embeddings of the teacher. With the instance-wise dataset mapped into a
bag-wise one, the new dataset can be applied to the distillation process for small models. The
knowledge which represents the relation of bagged instances can be transferred by aggregating the
bag, including inter-sample and intra-sample aggregation. Our BINGO follows a relation-guided
principle, which shows stronger effectiveness than previous relation-agnostic methods. The proposed
relation-based distillation is a general strategy for improving unsupervised representation, and we
hope it would shed light on new directions for unsupervised learning."

(where k=5) is slightly better than bagging via K-means clustering (with C=20000), i.e. 64.0% vs.
