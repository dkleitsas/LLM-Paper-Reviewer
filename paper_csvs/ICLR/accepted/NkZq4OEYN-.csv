ABSTRACT,0.002777777777777778,"Audio-visual navigation task requires an agent to find a sound source in a realis-
tic, unmapped 3D environment by utilizing egocentric audio-visual observations.
Existing audio-visual navigation works assume a clean environment that solely
contains the target sound, which, however, would not be suitable in most real-
world applications due to the unexpected sound noise or intentional interference.
In this work, we design an acoustically complex environment in which, besides
the target sound, there exists a sound attacker playing a zero-sum game with the
agent. More specifically, the attacker can move and change the volume and cate-
gory of the sound to make the agent suffer from finding the sounding object, while
the agent tries to dodge the attack and navigate to the goal under the intervention.
Under certain constraints to the attacker, we can improve the robustness of the
agent towards unexpected sound attacks in audio-visual navigation. For better
convergence, we develop a joint training mechanism by employing the property
of a centralized critic with decentralized actors. Experiments on two real-world
3D scan datasets (Replica and Matterport3D) verify the effectiveness and the ro-
bustness of the agent trained under our designed environment when transferred to
the clean environment or the one containing sound attackers with random policy.

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.008333333333333333,"Audio-visual navigation, as currently a vital task for embodied vision (Gordon et al., 2018; Lohmann
et al., 2020; Nagarajan & Grauman, 2020), requires the agent to find a sound target in a realistic and
unmapped 3D environment by exploring with egocentric audio-visual observations (Chen et al.,
2019; Gupta et al., 2017; Chaplot et al., 2020). Inspired by the simultaneous usage of eyes and ears
in human exploration (Wilcox et al., 2007; Flom & Bahrick, 2007), audio-visual association benefits
the learning of the agent (Gan et al., 2019; 2020a; Dean et al., 2020). A recent work Look, Listen,
and Act (LLA) has proposed a three-step navigation solution of perception, inference, and decision-
making (Gan et al., 2020b). SoundSpaces is the first work to establish an audio-visual embod-
ied navigation simulation platform equipped with the proposed Audio-Visual embodied Navigation
(AVN) baseline that resorts to reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2020). In response to the long-
term exploration problem that is caused by the large layout of the 3D scene and the long distance
to the target place, Audio-Visual Waypoint Navigation (AV-WaN) proposes an audio-visual naviga-
tion algorithm by setting waypoints as sub-goals to facilitate sound source discovering (Chen et al.,
2021b). Besides, Semantic Audio-Visual navigation (SAVi) develops a navigation algorithm in a
scene where the target sound is not periodic and has a variable length; that is, it may stop during the
navigation process (Chen et al., 2021a)."

INTRODUCTION,0.019444444444444445,"assumption is hardly the case in real life. For example, a kettle in the kitchen beeps to tell the robot
that the water is boiling, and the robot in the living room needs to navigate to the kitchen and turn
off the stove; while in the living room, two children are playing a game, chuckling loudly from
time to time. Such an example poses a crucial challenge on current techniques: can an agent still
find its way to the destination without being distracted by all non-target sounds around the agent?
Intuitively, the answer is no if the agent has not been trained in acoustically complex environments
as in the example listed above. Although the answer is no, this ability is what we expect the agent
to possess in real life."
INTRODUCTION,0.022222222222222223,"In light of these limitations, we propose first to construct such an acoustically complex environment.
In this environment, we add a sound attacker to intervene. This sound attacker can move and change
the volume and type of the sound at each time step. In particular, the objective of the sound attacker
is to make the agent frustrated by creating a distraction. In contrast, the agent decides how to move
at every time step, tries to dodge the sound attack, and explores for the sound target well under the
sound attack, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The competition between the attacker and the agent can be
modeled as a zero-sum two-player game. Notably, this is not a fair game and is more biased towards
the agent for two reasons. First, the sound attack is just single-modal and will not intervene in any
visual information obtained by the agent. Second, as will be specified in our methodology, the sound
volume of the attacker is bounded via a relative ratio (less than 1) of the sound target. We anticipate
constraining the attacker’s power and encouraging it to intervene but not defeat the agent with these
two considerations. With such a design, we can improve the agent’s robustness between the agent
and the sound attacker during the game. On the other hand, our environment is more demanding than
reality since there are few attackers in our lives. Instead, most behaviors, such as someone walking
and chatting past the robot, are not deliberately embarrassing the robot but just a distraction to the
robot, exhibiting weaker intervention strength than our adversarial setting. Even so, our experiments
reveal that an agent trained in a worst-case setting can perform promisingly when the environment
is acoustically clean or contains a natural sound intervenor using a random policy. On the contrary,
the agent trained in a clean environment becomes disabled in an acoustically complex environment."
INTRODUCTION,0.025,"Our training algorithm is built upon the architecture by (Chen et al., 2020), with a novel decision-
making branch for the attacker. Training two agents separately (Tampuu et al., 2017) leads to di-
vergence. Hence we propose a joint Actor-Critic (AC) training framework. We define the policies
for the attacker based on three types of information: position, sound volume, and sound category.
Exciting discoveries from experiments demonstrate that the joint training converges promisingly in
contrast to the independent training counterpart."
INTRODUCTION,0.027777777777777776,"This work is the first audio-visual navigation method with a sound attacker to the best of our knowl-
edge. To sum up, our contributions are as follows."
INTRODUCTION,0.030555555555555555,"• We construct a sound attacker to intervene environment for audio-visual navigation that
aims to improve the agent’s robustness. In contrast to the environment used by prior ex-
periments (Chen et al., 2020), our setting better simulates the practical case in which there

RELATED WORK,0.07777777777777778,"plans the robot’s navigation strategy based on graph-based shortest path planning. Following LLA,
AV-WaN (Chen et al., 2021b) combines dynamically setting waypoints with the shortest path algo-
rithm to solve the long-period audio-visual navigation problem. The second category of methods
works in the absence of a topological map (Chen et al., 2021a; 2020). In particular, SAVi (Chen
et al., 2021a) aims to solve the audio-visual navigation problem with temporary sound source by
introducing the category information of the source sound and pre-training the displacement from the
robot to the sound source; AVN (Chen et al., 2020) constructs the first audio-visual embodied nav-
igation simulation platform—SoundSpaces and makes use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the
training of the navigation policy. As presented in the Introduction, all environments used previously
(including SoundSpaces) assume clean sound sources, which is hardly the case in real and noisy life.
By contrast, we build an acoustically complex environment that allows a sound attacker to move and
change the volume and category of sound at each time step in an episode. In this environment, we
train the navigation policy of the agent under the sound attack, which delivers a more robust solution
in real applications."
RELATED WORK,0.08055555555555556,"Adversarial attacks and adversarial training in RL. In general, adversarial attacks (Tian & Xu,
2021) /training in RL are divided into two classes: learning to attack (Huang et al., 2017; Kos &
Song, 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Pattanaik et al., 2018) and learning to defence (Pinto et al., 2017;
Gleave et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) that targets on learn a robustness policy by state adversarial
through external forces or sensor noise. Our paper falls into the second class. A close work to our
method is State Adversarial MDP (SA-MDP) (Zhang et al., 2020) that leverages sensor noise in
vision to improve the robustness of the algorithm. The main difference between our method and
SA-MDP is that our method precisely permits a sound attacker to move in the room and employs
the resulting sound as a distractor, while in SA-MDP, the adversarial state is created arbitrarily and
thus not necessarily fits the actual scene. Besides, SA-MDP initially copes with the visual modality;
hence, we have changed SA-MDP for the attack of the sound modality for the comparison with our
method (See § 4)."

visual embodied navigation task. Our approach is composed of three main modules (Fig. 3). Given
visual and audio inputs, our model 1) encodes these cues and make a decision for the motion of
the agent, then 2) encodes these cues and decide how to act for the sound attacker to make an
acoustically complex environment, and finally 3) make a judgment for the agent and the attacker
and to optimization. The agent and the attacker repeat this process until the agent has been reached
and executes the Stop action."
SOUND ADVERSARIAL AUDIO-VISUAL NAVIGATION,0.19444444444444445,"Environment. Our work is based on the SoundSpaces (Chen et al., 2020) platform and Habitat
simulator (Savva et al., 2019) and with the publicly available datasets: Replica (Straub et al., 2019)
and Matterport3D (Chang et al., 2017) and SoundSpaces audio dataset. In SoundSpaces, the sound
is created by convolving the selected audio with the corresponding binaural room impulse responses
(RIRs) under one of the directions. When a sound attacker emits a chosen sound from its position,
the emitted omnidirectional audio is convolved with the corresponding binaural RIR to generate
a binaural response from the environment heard by the agent when facing each direction. In this
sense, the attacker’s sound also considers the reflections on the surface of objects in the environ-
ment, making it physically admissible and realistic. The agent’s reward is based on how close the
robot is away from the goal and whether it succeeds in reaching it. The setting is the same as of the
SoundSpaces. The action space of the agent is navigation motions, which is the same as the setting
of the SoundSpaces. An environment attacker embodied in the environment must take actions from
a hybrid action space Aν . For brevity, the abbreviation of superscripts position, volume, and cat-
egory are set to pos, vol, and cat, respectively. The hybrid action space is the Cartesian product of
navigation motions space Aν,pos, volume of sound space Aν,vol and category of sound space Aν,cat:

the agent, and the optimizer (See Fig. 3). At every time step t, the agent and the attacker receives
an observation Ot = (It, Bt), where I is the egocentric visual observation consisting of an RGB
and a depth image; B is the received binaural audio waveform represented as a two-channel spec-
trogram. Our model encodes each visual and audio observation with a CNN, respectively, where
the output of each CNN are visual vector fI1(It) and audio vector fB1(Bt). Then, we concatenate
the two vectors to obtain observation embedding representation e1 = [fI1(It), fB1(Bt)]. We trans-

EXPERIMENTS,0.33611111111111114,"Metrics and symbols.
The evaluations are compared by the following navigation metrics: 1)
success weighted by inverse path length (SPL): the standard metric (Anderson et al., 2018) that
weighs successes by their adherence to the shortest path; 2) Agent’s average episode reward: Rmean.
The detailed definitions of the symbols used later in this section are as follows: (1) πν,pos, πν,vol
and πν,cat are abbreviated as P, V and C respectively. (2) X, Xrandom and Xfix denote policies,
where X ∈{P, V, C} is a policy to learn, Xrandom is a random policy, and when X ∈{P}, Xfix
is a determined policy which acts a constant action after random initialization in an episode, while
X ∈{V, C}, Xfix is a determined policy which act a constant action set in advance in all episodes.
(3) X, Yfix is abbreviated as X, where X is a policy, and Y ∈{{P, V, C} \ {X}} are set to a
determined policy Yfix. (4) SAAVN:X stands for a model variant, where X is a policy for πν and
X ∈{P, V, C}. (5) SAAVN:X,Y=0.1 is a model variant named SAAVN:X, and Yfix is set to
0.1, where X ∈{P, V, C}, Y ∈{{P, V, C} \ {X}}. (6) SAAVN:X,Y=0.1,Z=person6 is a model
variant named SAAVN:X, where Yfix is set to 0.1, Zfix is set to person6, X ∈{P, V, C}, Y ∈
{{P, V, C} \ {X}}, Z ∈{{P, V, C} \ {X, Y }}. See appx. H and F for more details."

the performance of different models under different sound attacks. We found that these sound at-
tackers have certain attack capabilities against these three algorithms. However, it is found that our
method’s performance decreases more slowly, which fully demonstrates that our method helps to

EXPERIMENTS,0.38333333333333336,"Is the louder the sound attacker’s volume, the better?
To verify the navigation ability of an
agent that has grown in an acoustically complex environment in a clean environment, we first train
our model in the acoustically complex environments where the sound attacker exists and then test the
navigation ability of the model by migrating to the environment which the sound attacker is removed.
In Fig. 6, SAAVN : P, V=0.1 is short for a model variant named SAAVN : P, V=0.1, C=person6.
Others are similar. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the navigation ability of the attacker is excellent
when the volume of the attacker is 0.1 and 0.9, but not very good when the volume is 0.5. The
ablation experiments show that simply increasing the sound volume of the attacker does not neces-
sarily lead to better performance. The relationship between the navigation capacity and the volume
of the sound attacker is not straightforward and depends on other factors, including the position and
sound category. It hence supports the necessity of our method to make the volume policy of the
attacker learnable. As such, agents can learn better navigation skills in an acoustically intervened
environment."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.4638888888888889,"This paper proposes a game where an agent competes with a sound attacker in an acoustical interven-
tion environment. We have designed various games of different complexity levels by changing the
attack policy regarding the position, sound volume, and sound category. Interestingly, we find that
the policy of an agent trained in acoustically complex environments can still perform promisingly
in acoustically simple settings, but not vice versa. This observation necessitates our contribution in
bridging the gap between audio-visual navigation research and its real-world applications. A com-
plete set of ablation studies is also carried out to verify the optimal choice of our model design and
training algorithm. However, the limitation of our work is that we only assume one sound attacker
and have not studied the scenario with two and more attackers. Another limitation of our work is
that our current evaluations are conducted in virtual environments. It will make better sense to assess
our method on practical cases like a robot navigating in a real house. The above two will be left for
future exploration. Since our research is conducted on a simulation platform, it is unlikely to cause
a negative social impact in the foreseeable future."

DEFINITIONS."
REFERENCES,0.6111111111111112,"Definition 2 Acoustically clean or simple environment. The acoustically clean or simple environ-
ment is described as follows: (1) The number of target sound sources is one. (2) The position of the
target sound source is fixed in an episode of a scene. (3) The volume of the target sound source is
the same in all episodes of all scenes, and there is no change."
REFERENCES,0.6138888888888889,"Definition 3 The acoustically complex environment.
The acoustically complex environment
referred to in this study is defined as follows: (1) There is one non-target sound source in the scene.
(2) The position of the non-target sound source is uncertain, which means that the position of the
non-target sound source in the scene is arbitrary. (3) The volume of the non-target sound source
is uncertain. It is only known that the maximum volume of the non-target sound is equal to the
maximum volume of the target non-target sound source, but the specific volume is uncertain. (4) The
sound category of the non-target sound source is uncertain. Only the set to which the non-target
sound category belongs is the same as the set to which the target sound source category belongs.
(5)The attacker has no physical entity. It is like an invisible ghost. It has no shape, no volume,
and no mass. When the agent runs in front of it, it will not block its movement or collide with the
agent. This assumption is to simplify the model. These non-target sounds are a major obstacle to
audio-visual embodied navigation, which greatly increases the search time."

(1) Although non-target and target sounds belong to the same spectrum range, these non-target
sounds are not suitable for Gaussian use. Distribution is used for modeling, and noise is suitable
for modeling with Gaussian distribution. It is difficult to model both the non-target low voice and
the target’s natural gas alarm sound. (2) The existence of these non-target sounds is a significant
obstacle to audio-visual embodied navigation, which significantly increases the search time. (3)
These non-target sounds may not move like the target, or they may explore around the scene. Our
work is based on the scope of the above definition."

PROPERTIES OF FOURIER TRANSFORM."
REFERENCES,0.625,"Property 2 The following three properties of the Fourier transform need to be used when proving
the Theorem 1.
1. Linearity : The Fourier transform of sum of two or more functions is the sum of the Fourier
transforms of the functions. F(a + b) = F(a) + F(b). If we multiply a function by a constant, the
Fourier transform of the resultant function is multiplied by the same constant. F(k · a) = k · F(a).
2. Convolution : The Fourier transform of a convolution of two functions is the point-wise product
of their respective Fourier transforms. F(f ∗g) = F(f) · F(g).
3. Dirac delta function : Fourier transform of Dirac delta function is
1
2π. So F(ψ) =

MULTI-MODAL FUSION ABLATION FOR SOUND ATTACKER AUDIO-VISUAL NAVIGATION."
REFERENCES,0.9638888888888889,"Is concatenation the best choice for multi-modal fusion? We did not explore which choice is the best
for multi-modal fusion in the main paper since this is not the main focus of our paper (all methods
share the same fusion setting). However, we do think this is an exciting point. Hence, besides
concatenation, we have also conducted another fusion strategy using element-wise multiplication.
Specifically, we first obtain the visual and audio embedding vectors of the same size (i.e., 512)
and then compute the element-wise multiplication between these two vectors. Table 17 reports the
performance of SAAVN: PVC in the environment PVC under these two different fusion scenarios."
