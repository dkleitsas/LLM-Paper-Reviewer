ABSTRACT,0.0017825311942959,"As machine learning algorithms are deployed ubiquitously to a variety of domains,
it is imperative to make these often black-box models transparent. Several recent
works explain black-box models by capturing the most influential features for pre-
diction per instance; such explanation methods are univariate, as they characterize
importance per feature. We extend univariate explanation to a higher-order; this
enhances explainability, as bivariate methods can capture feature interactions in
black-box models, represented as a directed graph. Analyzing this graph enables
us to discover groups of features that are equally important (i.e., interchangeable),
while the notion of directionality allows us to identify the most influential features.
We apply our bivariate method on Shapley value explanations, and experimentally
demonstrate the ability of directional explanations to discover feature interactions.
We show the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art on CIFAR10, IMDB,
Census, Divorce, Drug, and gene data."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.0053475935828877,"The ability to interpret and understand the reasoning behind black box decision-making increases user
trust; it provides insights into how a model is working and, as a consequence, how a model can be
improved. This has led to a large body of work on the development of explanation methods (Ribeiro
et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018; Yoon et al., 2018; Lundberg & Lee, 2017) applied to black-box models.
Such methods aim to explain black-box behavior by understanding how individual features influence
prediction outcomes. Recently, Covert et al. (2020a) proposed a unifying mathematical framework
capturing a broad array of explainability techniques, termed Removal-based Explanation methods.
Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of explainability methods have a significant drawback: they
only provide univariate explanations and, as a result, they do not take into account feature interactions.
This is problematic precisely because many black box models, such as deep neural networks, perform
well by creating complex structures and combining features in their latent layers. To address
this, recent methods have been proposed to learn the interaction between features (Sundararajan
et al., 2020a; Maas et al., 2011). Their definition of interaction assumes features affect each other
symmetrically; however, in many real-world applications, feature interactions may be asymmetrical.
We also observe this experimentally (see Fig. 1), and argue of the importance of developing black-box
explanations that not only capture interactions, but also incorporate asymmetry. Overall, we make the
following contributions:"
INTRODUCTION,0.0071301247771836,"• We propose a method to extend any given univariate removal-based explanation to a bivariate
explanation model that can capture asymmetrical feature interactions, represented as a directed
graph. Our method is general, and can be applied to a broad array of univariate removal-based
explanations, as defined by Covert et al. (2020a).
• We show that analyzing this graph gives a semantically-rich interpretation of black boxes. In
particular, beyond the ability to identify most influential features, the graph can identify directionally
redundant features, i.e., features whose presence negates the influence of other features, as well as"

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.016042780748663103,"Many methods have been proposed for explaining black box models (Guidotti et al., 2018). For
instance, LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) explains the prediction of a model by learning a linear model
locally around a sample, through which it quantifies feature influences on the prediction. SHAP
(Lundberg & Lee, 2017) learns an influence score for each feature based on the Shapley value
(Shapley, 2016). L2X (Chen et al., 2018) learns a set of most influential features per sample based on
the mutual information between features and labels. Recently, Covert et al. (2020a) unified many of
such explanation methods under a single framework; we present this in detail in Sec. 3."
RELATED WORK,0.017825311942959002,"However, all of these methods only capture the univariate influence of each feature; i.e., they do not
explain feature interactions. Discovering feature interactions has drawn recent interest in machine
learning (Bondell & Reich, 2008; Chormunge & Jena, 2018; Zeng & Figueiredo, 2014; Janizek et al.,
2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Tsang et al., 2018; 2020). Tsang et al. (2017) proposed a framework to detect
statistical interactions in a feed-forward neural network by directly interpreting the weights of the
model. Cui et al. (2020) proposed a non-parametric probabilistic method to detect global interactions.
However, most such methods study feature interactions globally (for all instances). In contrast, our
work detects interactions per individual instance. The work more related to explainability of a black
box via feature interaction is Shapley interaction. Grabisch & Roubens (1999) proposed a Shapley
interaction value to explore the interaction between features rather than feature influence. Lundberg
et al. (2018a) and Sundararajan et al. (2020a) applied Shapley interaction value to explain black box
predictions. Instance-wise Feature Grouping (Masoomi et al., 2020) explored the effects of feature
interaction by allocating features to different groups based on the similarity of their contribution to the
prediction task. These methods assume a symmetrical interaction between features; in contrast, our
method provides instance-wise explanations that can capture asymmetrical (directional) interactions."
RELATED WORK,0.0196078431372549,"Another type of explainers are Graph Neural Network (GNN) explainers (Yuan et al., 2020). These
methods assume that the black-box model has a GNN architecture; i.e. the model incorporates the
input graph structure in its predictions. In contrast, our method allows the black box to be any type of
function (e.g., CNN, GNN, Random Forest) and does not assume access to a graph structure: we
learn the feature interactions directly from the data. A small subset of GNN explainers, especially
local, perturbation-based methods (such as Yuan et al. (2021); Duval & Malliaros (2021); Luo et al.
(2020); Ying et al. (2019)) can be applied to black-box models. This can be done by assuming a
non-informative interaction structure on the data and allowing the explainers to mask or perturb the
interaction edges. However, non-GNN black box models are unable to utilize the graph structure."
RELATED WORK,0.0213903743315508,"Causal methods provide explanations through feature influence by utilizing knowledge about causal
dependencies. Frye et al. (2020) generalized the Shapley-value framework to incorporate causality.
In particular, they provided a new formulation for computing Shapley value when a partial causal
understanding of data is accessible, which they called Asymmetric Shapley values. Wang et al.
(2021a) extend this idea to incorporate the entire casual graph to reason about the feature influence
on the output prediction. Causal methods rely on prior access to casual relationships; in contrast, our
method learns the asymmetrical interaction between features rather than causal dependencies."

BACKGROUND,0.030303030303030304,"Univariate Removal-Based Explanations. The unifying framework of Covert et al. identifies three
stages in a removal-based explanation method. The first, feature-removal, defines how the method
perturbs input samples by removing features; the second, termed model-behavior, captures the effect
that this feature removal has on the black-box model predictions; finally, the summary stage abstracts
the impact of feature subset selection to a numerical score for each feature, capturing the overall
influence of the feature in the output. Formally, a black-box model is a function f : X →Y, mapping
input features x ∈X ⊆Rd to labels y ∈Y. Let D ≡{1, . . . , d} be the feature space coordinates.
Given an input x ∈X and a subset of features S ⊆D, let xS = [xi]i∈S ∈Rd be the projection of x
to the features in S. In the local interpretability setting, we are given a black-box model f, an input
x ∈X and (in some methods) the additional ground truth label y ∈Y, and wish to interpret the
output f(x) produced by the model. The three stages of the removal based model are defined by a

indicating positive or negative sentiment. We used a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as the black
box and SHAP as the univariate explainer. Specifically, given a black box model f and a point

explanation graph G/bivariate explanation E2 for the sentence, “The movie is the worst; surprisingly
awful”, which is predicted to have negative sentiment. Both explanations are shown in Fig. 1. We

of the black box outcome). However, looking at E2, we realize this explanation is in fact misleading.
The absence of an edge from ‘worst’ →‘surprisingly’ suggests that in the presence of ‘worst’ the

more graduated approach seems warranted, to identify nodes that are ‘almost’ sinks (like ‘surprisingly’

the classic PageRank (Page et al., 1999) or HITS (Kleinberg, 1999).2 These correspond to the steady
state distribution over a random walk on the graph with random restarts; as such it indeed offers
a more graduated version of the notion of “sinkness”, as desired. Variants, such as personalized
PageRank (Page et al., 1999), can also be used, whereby the random restart is to a node sampled from

makes ‘surprisingly’ redundant, but not vice-versa). Motivated by this, we define:"
ANALYZING THE DIRECTIONAL EXPLANATION GRAPH,0.13725490196078433,"Definition 4.1. Given i, j ∈D, i is directionally redundant with respect to feature j if E2(u)ij = 0."
ANALYZING THE DIRECTIONAL EXPLANATION GRAPH,0.13903743315508021,"Directionality arises in Def. 4.1 because E2(u) in general is not symmetric, i.e., E2(u)ij ̸= E2(u)ji.
Nevertheless, we can have features i, j that have the same influence on the model (e.g. ‘awful’ and
‘worst’ in the example). We formalize this idea to the E2 explanation through the following definition:"
ANALYZING THE DIRECTIONAL EXPLANATION GRAPH,0.1408199643493761,"Definition 4.2. Given i, j ∈D, features i, j are mutually redundant if E2(u)ij = E2(u)ji = 0."
ANALYZING THE DIRECTIONAL EXPLANATION GRAPH,0.14260249554367202,"Transitivity of Mutually Redundant Features. Given that mutual redundancy is symmetric, it is
natural to ask if it is also transitive: if ‘bad’ and ‘awful’ are mutually redundant, and so are ‘awful’
and ‘terrible’, would that imply that ‘bad’ and ‘terrible’ are also mutually redundant? This behavior is
natural, and suggests that groups of features may act interchangeably (here, corresponding to variants
of ‘bad’). Identifying such groups is important for interpreting the model, as it exhibits an invariant
behavior under the exchange of such features. We thus turn our attention to studying the transitivity
properties of mutual redundancy. To do this, we define unweighted directed graph H = (VH, EH),
where VH = VG and EH = {(i, j) ∈EG| WG(i, j) = 0}. Graph H captures the redundancies
between any two features: an edge from i to j (i.e., i →j) indicates that feature j is directionally
redundant with respect to feature i. We call H the Redundancy Graph. In practice, we may use the
relaxed version of redundancy. Given a redundancy threshold γ, we define Hγ = (VH, Eγ
H) to be
a graph where VH = VG and Eγ
H = {(i, j) ∈EG : |WG(i, j)| ≤γ}. Intuitively, if the presence of
a feature makes the influence of the other less than the threshold γ, we still declare the latter to be
redundant. If mutual redundancy is transitive, Graph H is also transitive; formally:"

ANALYZING THE DIRECTIONAL EXPLANATION GRAPH,0.16399286987522282,"Sources and Sinks in the Redundancy Graph. Beyond identifying classes of mutually redundant
features, the redundancy graph H can also be used to identify (classes of) features under which all
remaining features become redundant. This can be accomplished in the following fashion. First, the
strongly connected components/classes of mutually redundant features need to be discovered. As a
consequence of Thm. 1, such strongly connected components will be cliques if the exact Shapley
explanation map is used, or almost cliques if the threshold γ is non-zero. Collapsing these connected
components we obtain a DAG, also known as the quotient graph (see App B). The sources of this
quotient graph (which may correspond to entire classes) correspond to feature classes that make
all other features redundant (possibly through transitivity). Note the distinction between sinks in G
and sources in H, that may be a different set of nodes, and capture a different kind of importance.
Again, rather than determining importance simply from the fact that a node in H is a source, a more
graduated approach, using a harmonic function of nodes like Pagerank (over H) could be used."

EXPERIMENTS,0.16755793226381463,"In this section, we investigate the ability of Bivariate Shapley for discovering (a) mutual redundancy,
(b) directional redundancy, and (c) influential features, from black-box models. Fully evaluating
Shapley values is computationally expensive; we implement Bivariate Shapley using two different
Shapley approximation methods for comparison, Shapley Sampling (BivShap-S) and KernelSHAP
(BivShap-K). The algorithms are outlined in App. G.1.1. The KernelSHAP approximation signifi-
cantly reduces computational time (Tbl. 1) at the cost of slightly reduced Post-hoc accuracy results
(Tbl. 3). In our method comparisons, we take 500 test samples from each dataset (less if the test
set is smaller than 500) and generate their respective G and H graphs. We select γ = 10−5 for the
threshold in converting G to H, which generally corresponds to 50% average graph density across
the datasets (see App. G.2.4 for details). All experiments are performed on an internal cluster with
Intel Xeon Gold 6132 CPUs and Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs. All source code is publicly available.3"

impact to accuracy under the BivShap method. In contrast, the groups identified by the other methods

this suggests that incorporating directionality is critical in identifying mutually redundant features;
undirected methods do not capture the full context of feature interactions. We also note that no
mutually redundant features were found by GNNExplainer, which indicates that the edges of its
explanation graph are unable to capture feature interchangeability."
EXPERIMENTS,0.19429590017825313,"(b) Directional Redundancy Evaluation. We validate directional redundancy using post-hoc
accuracy as shown in Tbl. 2. Additional results for BivShap-K are shown in App. G.2.3. We identify
directionally redundant features as H-sink nodes, which we identify using PageRank. We collapse
the strongly connected components in graph H to its quotient graph S, then apply PageRank to each
connected graph in S. The maximum and minimum ranked nodes in each connected graph correspond
to the sinks and sources in S, respectively. The condensed sinks and sources are expanded to form H-
sinks and H-sources. We then evaluate the relevance of the identified nodes using post-hoc accuracy
of masked samples. To validate our claims of directionality, we compare the results of masking
H-source nodes and H-sink nodes, where H-sink nodes represent the directionally redundant features.
We observe in Tbl. 2 that masking sinks has little effect on accuracy, suggesting that these features
contain redundant information given the unmasked source nodes. In contrast, masking H-source
nodes and keeping sinks results in large decreases in accuracy, indicating that prediction-relevant
information is lost during masking."

individually using graph H, we can combine both concepts in a continuous ranking of features

to the adjacency matrix of G to ensure that all nodes are connected, then directly apply PageRank.
The resulting feature scores are ranked, with high-scoring features representing high importance.
We observe the experimental results in Fig. 3. BivShap-S consistently performs the best across
data sets, including against BivShap-K, which suggests some small accuracy tradeoff for the faster
approximation. Note that Bivariate Shapley does not explicitly utilize feature importance, but
rather each feature’s steady-state distribution. However, we can also incorporate feature importance"

SOCIETAL IMPACTS"
REFERENCES,0.39928698752228164,"As machine learning algorithms are widely deployed to a variety of domains such as health care,
criminal justice system, and financial markets (LeCun et al., 2015; Doshi-Velez & Kim, 2017;
Faghihpirayesh et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021b; Lipton, 2018; Caruana et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015;
Wu et al., 2018), it is important to make these often black-box models transparent. Understanding the
reasoning behind the decisions in black-box models may enable users’ trust in the model. This paper
proposes a novel method to explain black-box models. In particular, we extend univariate feature
removal-based explanations to higher-order bivariate explanations that allows discovery of directional
feature interactions. Explainability opens up future research directions that can help data scientists
check for bias, fairness, and vulnerabilities of the models they use (Arrieta et al., 2020; Guidotti
et al., 2018)."
REFERENCES,0.40106951871657753,"This paper provides a general machine learning approach for explaining black-box models that can
be applied to any data. We care about possible societal impact of applying machine learning to
advance our understanding of disease. In this paper, our explanation method allows us to find the
most influential genes for differentiating smokers versus non-smokers, potentially leading to a better
understanding of the relationship between smoking and lung disease by identifying how genes interact
with each other for a smoker versus a non-smoker. We plan to pursue further analysis of our results
with careful guidance and insights from our medical expert collaborators. Machine learning (ML)
can be applied to a variety of applications (to do harm or good), we encourage our colleagues to
apply ML to beneficial applications such as health. Nevertheless, to be done correctly, one needs to
work closely with domain experts to make proper judgments and lead to accurate conclusions. To
increase the impact of our method, we make our source code publicly available.4"

complexity to the original algorithm; we simply keep track of when feature j is absent (i.e. j /∈S

sampled model outputs and reuse these values when recalculating KernelSHAP over all d features.
This allows for a fixed number of model samples independent of the number of data features. Second,
note that KernelSHAP attributions are calculated through a weighted linear regression mechanism.
Bivariate Shapley simply changes the model output (setting the output to zero) depending on whether a
feature is present or removed, which corresponds to applying a binary mask over the linear regression
labels. Therefore we can save the intermediate linear regression calculation and evaluate each column
of the interaction matrix with two matrix multiplications with the sparse labels. This results in
significant speed improvements and allows scaling to datasets with large number of features, such as
the COPD dataset with 1,077 features."

returns edge importance values for the given data sample. This output can be converted to a subgraph
using specifying a threshold, below which the edges are removed. In our experiments, we directly
use the edge importance values as the weights of a directed, weighted graph. This resulting graph

SENSITIVITY OF GRAPH Hγ TO γ"
REFERENCES,0.948306595365419,"In Section 4.1 we define a relaxed version of the redundancy graph Hγ = (VH, Eγ
H) where VH = VG
and Eγ
H = {(i, j) ∈EG : |WG(i, j)| ≤γ}. Intuitively, γ ∈R+ acts as a threshold to define
redundant edges in Hγ. As γ increases, the number of edges in Hγ also increases, resulting in larger
mutually redundant clusters and a higher sensitivity to directional redundancy. From the perspective
of accurately representing the black-box model, the choice of γ presents a tradeoff akin to sensitivity
and specificity: larger γ values more easily identify true redundancies within the data (increased
sensitivity), at the cost of potentially mislabeling non-redundancies (reduced specificity)."

GENE ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS OF COPDGENE DATASET"
REFERENCES,0.9946524064171123,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease. The relation
between COPD and smoking is well-established; it has been shown that smoking increases the
risk of developing lung disease through a variety of ways, such as increasing lung inflammation
(Arnson et al., 2010). Here, we investigate the relation between gene expression data and smoking
status in COPDGene data. We show the interpretation power of our methods by relating our most
influential genes to biological pathways which correspond to smoking. We performed Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using the GenePattern web interface (Reich et al., 2006) on the ranking
of influential features, which we generate as follows. We first calculate graph G locally, as in Alg. 1.
We then create the global G graph for each subgroup, smokers and non-smokers, by averaging the
G adjacency matrix over all samples within each subgroup (Fig. 8). We directly apply the ranking
algorithm outlined in Section G.1.1 to obtain subgroup-specific importance scores. We use the list
of 1,079 unique gene names with their associated importance score as input into the GenePattern
interface. Gene set enrichment for these two groups was calculated using the GSEAPreranked
module with 1000 permutations, using the Hallmark (h.all.v7.4.symbols.gmt) and Immunologic gene
sets (c7.all.v7.4.symbols.gmt). We observed genetic pathways corresponding to Macrophages as
statistically significant at a q-value ≤0.05 (the pathway table is in the App., Table. 9). Macrophages
are a type of immune cells that can initiate inflammation, and they also involve the detection and
destruction of bacteria in the body. The relation between such cells and smoking has been observed
in biological domain; many studies have observed that smoking induces changes in immune cell
function in COPD patients (Yang & Chen, 2018; Strzelak et al., 2018)."
