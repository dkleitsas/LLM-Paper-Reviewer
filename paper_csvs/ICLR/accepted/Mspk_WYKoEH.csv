ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.002770083102493075,"Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a common type of Graph Neural
Network (GNN), in which each node’s representation is computed recursively by
aggregating representations (“messages”) from its immediate neighbors akin to a
star-shaped pattern. MPNNs are appealing for being efficient and scalable, how-
ever their expressiveness is upper-bounded by the 1st-order Weisfeiler-Leman iso-
morphism test (1-WL). In response, prior works propose highly expressive mod-
els at the cost of scalability and sometimes generalization performance. Our work
stands between these two regimes: we introduce a general framework to uplift
any MPNN to be more expressive, with limited scalability overhead and greatly
improved practical performance. We achieve this by extending local aggregation
in MPNNs from star patterns to general subgraph patterns (e.g., k-egonets): in
our framework, each node representation is computed as the encoding of a sur-
rounding induced subgraph rather than encoding of immediate neighbors only
(i.e. a star). We choose the subgraph encoder to be a GNN (mainly MPNNs,
considering scalability) to design a general framework that serves as a wrapper
to uplift any GNN. We call our proposed method GNN-AK (GNN As Kernel), as
the framework resembles a convolutional neural network by replacing the kernel
with GNNs. Theoretically, we show that our framework is strictly more powerful
than 1&2-WL, and is not less powerful than 3-WL. We also design subgraph sam-
pling strategies which greatly reduce memory footprint and improve speed while
maintaining performance. Our method sets new state-of-the-art performance by
large margins for several well-known graph ML tasks; specifically, 0.08 MAE on
ZINC, 74.79% and 86.887% accuracy on CIFAR10 and PATTERN respectively."

INTRODUCTION,0.008310249307479225,"Graphs are permutation invariant, combinatorial structures used to represent relational data, with
wide applications ranging from drug discovery, social network analysis, image analysis to bioin-
formatics (Duvenaud et al., 2015; Fan et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020). In recent
years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have rapidly surpassed traditional methods like heuristically
defined features and graph kernels to become the dominant approach for graph ML tasks."
INTRODUCTION,0.0110803324099723,"Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) (Gilmer et al., 2017) are the most common type of
GNNs owing to their intuitiveness, effectiveness and efficiency. They follow a recursive aggregation
mechanism where each node aggregates information from its immediate neighbors repeatedly. How-
ever, unlike simple multi-layer feedforward networks (MLPs) which are universal approximators of
continuous functions (Hornik et al., 1989), MPNNs cannot approximate all permutation-invariant
graph functions (Maron et al., 2019b). In fact, their expressiveness is upper bounded by the first
order Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) isomorphism test (Xu et al., 2018). Importantly, researchers have
shown that such 1-WL equivalent GNNs are not expressive, or powerful, enough to capture basic
structural concepts, i.e., counting motifs such as cycles or triangles (Zhengdao et al., 2020; Arvind
et al., 2020) that are shown to be informative for bio- and chemo-informatics (Elton et al., 2019)."

discriminate graphs from an isomorphism test perspective; Chen et al. (2019) prove the equivalence

2020b) try to incorporate k-WL in the design of more powerful GNNs, while others approach k-WL"

2019) and matrix language perspectives (Balcilar et al., 2021). However, they require O(k)-order
tensors to achieve k-WL expressiveness, and thus are not scalable or feasible for application on
large, practical graphs. Besides, the bias-variance tradeoff between complexity and generalization
(Neal et al., 2018) and the fact that almost all graphs (i.e. O(2(
n
2)) graphs on n vertices, Babai
et al. (1980)) can be distinguished by 1-WL challenge the necessity of developing such extremely
expressive models. In a complementary line of work, Loukas (2020a) sheds light on developing
more powerful GNNs while maintaining linear scalability, finding that MPNNs can be universal
approximators provided that nodes are sufficiently distinguishable. Relatedly, several works propose
to add features to make nodes more distinguishable, such as identifiers (Loukas, 2020a), subgraph
counts (Bouritsas et al., 2020), distance encoding (Li et al., 2020), and random features (Sato et al.,
2021; Abboud et al., 2021). However, these methods either focus on handcrafted features which lose
the premise of automatic learning, or create permutation sensitive features that hurt generalization."
INTRODUCTION,0.0886426592797784,"Present Work. Our work stands between the two regimes of extremely expressive but unscalable k-
order GNNs, and the limited expressiveness yet high scalability of MPNNs. Specifically, we propose
a general framework that serves as a “wrapper” to uplift any GNN. We observe that MPNNs’ local
neighbor aggregation follows a star pattern, where the representation of a node is characterized by
applying an injective aggregator function as an encoder to the star subgraph (comprised of the central
node and edges to neighbors). We propose a design which naturally generalizes from encoding the
star to encoding a more flexibly defined subgraph, and we replace the standard injective aggregator
with a GNN: in short, we characterize the new representation of a node by using a GNN to encode
a locally induced encompassing subgraph, as shown in Fig.1. This uplifts GNN as a base model
in effect by applying it on each subgraph instead of the whole input graph. This generalization is
close to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in computer vision: like the CNN that convolves
image patches with a kernel to compute new pixel embeddings, our designed wrapper convolves
subgraphs with a GNN to generate new node embeddings. Hence, we name our approach GNN-AK
(GNN As Kernel). We show theoretically that GNN-AK is strictly more powerful than 1&2-WL with
any MPNN as base model, and is not less powerful than 3-WL with PPGN (Maron et al., 2019a)
used. We also give sufficient conditions under which GNN-AK can successfully distinguish two
non-isomorphic graphs. Given this increase in expressive power, we discuss careful implementa-
tion strategies for GNN-AK, which allow us to carefully leverage multiple modalities of information
from subgraph encoding, and resulting in an empirically more expressive version GNN-AK+. As
a result, GNN-AK and GNN-AK+ induce a constant factor overhead in memory. To amplify our
method’s practicality, we further develop a subgraph sampling strategy inspired by Dropout (Srivas-
tava et al., 2014) to drastically reduce this overhead (1-3× in practice) without hurting performance.
We conduct extensive experiments on 4 simulation datasets and 5 well-known real-world graph clas-
sification & regression benchmarks (Dwivedi et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020), to show significant and
consistent practical benefits of our approach across different MPNNs and datasets. Specifically,
GNN-AK+ sets new state-of-the-art performance on ZINC, CIFAR10, and PATTERN – for exam-
ple, on ZINC we see a relative error reduction of 60.3%, 50.5%, and 39.4% for base model being"

INTRODUCTION,0.09418282548476455,"GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017), GIN (Xu et al., 2018), and (a variant of) PNA (Corso et al., 2020)

• A General GNN-AK Framework. We propose GNN-AK (and enhanced GNN-AK+), a general
framework which uplifts any GNN by encoding local subgraph structure with a GNN.
• Theoretical Findings. We show that GNN-AK’s expressiveness is strictly better than 1&2-WL,
and is not less powerful than 3-WL. We analyze sufficient conditions for successful discrimination.
• Effective and Efficient Realization. We present effective implementations for GNN-AK and
GNN-AK+ to fully exploit all node embeddings within a subgraph. We design efficient online
subgraph sampling to mitigate memory and runtime overhead while maintaining performance.
• Experimental Results. We show strong empirical results, demonstrating both expressivity im-
provements as well as practical performance gains where we achieve new state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on several graph-level benchmarks.
Our implementation is easy-to-use, and directly accepts any GNN from PyG (Fey & Lenssen, 2019)
for plug-and-play use. See code at https://github.com/GNNAsKernel/GNNAsKernel."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.0997229916897507,"Exploiting subgraph information in GNNs is not new; in fact, k-WL considers all k node sub-
graphs. Monti et al. (2018); Lee et al. (2019) exploit motif information within aggregation, and
others (Bouritsas et al., 2020; Barcel´o et al., 2021) augment MPNN features with handcrafted sub-
graph based features. MixHop (Abu-El-Haija et al., 2019) directly aggregates k-hop information
by using adjacency matrix powers, ignoring neighbor connections. Towards a meta-learning goal,
G-meta (Huang & Zitnik, 2020) applies GNNs on rooted subgraphs around each node to help trans-
ferring ability. Tahmasebi & Jegelka (2020) only theoretically justifies subgraph convolution with
GNN by showing its ability in counting substructures. Zhengdao et al. (2020) also represent a node
by encoding its local subgraph, however using non-scalable relational pooling. k-hop GNN (Niko-
lentzos et al., 2020) uses k-egonet in a specially designed way: it encodes a rooted subgraph via
sequentially passing messages from k-th hops in the subgraph to k −1 hops, until it reaches the
root node, and use the root node as encoding of the subgraph. Ego-GNNs (Sandfelder et al., 2021)
computes a context encoding with SGC (Wu et al., 2019) as the subgraph encoder, and only be
studied on node-level tasks. Both k-hop GNN and Ego-GNNs can be viewed as a special case of
GNN-AK. You et al. (2021) designs ID-GNNs which inject node identity during message passing
with the help of k-egonet, with k being the number of layers of GNN (Hamilton et al., 2017). Un-
like GNN-AK which uses rooted subgraphs, Fey et al. (2020); Thiede et al. (2021); Bodnar et al.
(2021a) design GNNs to use certain subgraph patterns (like cycles and paths) in message passing,
however their preprocessing requires solving the subgraph isomorphism problem. Cotta et al. (2021)
explores reconstructing a graph from its subgraphs. A contemporary work (Zhang & Li, 2021) also
encodes rooted subgraphs with a base GNN but it essentially views a graph as a bag of subgraphs
while GNN-AK modifies the 1-WL color refinement and has many iterations. Viewing graph as a
bag of subgraphs is also explored in another contemporary work (Bevilacqua et al., 2022). To sum-
marize, our work differs by (i) proposing a general subgraph encoding framework motivated from
theoretical Subgraph-1-WL for uplifting GNNs, and (ii) addressing scalability issues involved with
using subgraphs, which poses significant challenges for subgraph-based methods in practice. See
additional related work in Appendix.A.1."

When two graphs are non-isomorphic, there exists a subgraph where this difference is captured (see
Figure 3). Although a fixed-expressiveness GNN may not distinguish the two original graphs, it
may distinguish the two smaller subgraphs, given that the required expressiveness for successful
discrimination is proportional to graph size (Loukas, 2020b). As such, GNN-AK divides the harder
problem of encoding the whole graph to smaller and easier problems of encoding its subgraphs, and
“conquers” the encoding with the base GNN."

easy to derive (Zaheer et al., 2017). In contrast, Subgraph-1-WL must hash a general subgraph ,
where an injective hash function for graphs is non-trivial (as hard as graph isomorphism). Thus,
we derive a variant called Subgraph-1-WL∗by using a weaker choice for HASH(·) – specifically,
1-WL. Effectively, we nest 1-WL inside Subgraph-1-WL. Formally,
Definition 3.2 (Subgraph-1-WL∗). Subgraph-1-WL∗is a less expressive variant of Subgraph-1-

Different from subgraph and centroid encodings, the context encoding captures views of node v
from different subgraph contexts, or points-of-view. Second, GNN-AK extracts the rooted subgraph
for every node with efficient k-hop propagation (complexity O(k|E|)), along which the distance-to-
centroid (D2C)3 within each subgraph is readily recorded at no additional cost and can be used to
augment node features; (Li et al., 2020) shows this theoretically improves expressiveness. There-
fore, we propose to uses the D2C by default in two ways in GNN-AK+: (i) augmenting hidden
representation h(l)

subgraph extractor. Specifically, to extract a subgraph rooted at node v, we perform a fixed-length
random walk starting at v, resulting in visited nodes Nrw(v) and their induced subgraph G[Nrw(v)].
In practice, we use adaptive random walks as in Grover & Leskovec (2016). To reduce randomness,
we use multiple truncated random walks and union the visited nodes as Nrw(v). Moreover, we

IMPROVING SCALABILITY: SUBGRAPHDROP"
CONCRETE REALIZATION,0.2548476454293629,"The complexity analysis reveals that GNN-AK(+) introduce a constant factor overhead (subgraph
size) in runtime and memory over the base GNN. Subgraph size can be naturally reduced by choos-
ing smaller k for k-egonet, or by ranking and truncating visited nodes in a random walk setting.
However limiting to very small subgraphs tends to hurt performance as we empirically show in Ta-
ble 6. Here, we present a different subsampling-based approach that carefully selects only a subset
of the |V| rooted subgraphs. Further more, inspired from Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014), we only
drop subgraphs during training while still use all subgraphs when evaluation. Novel strategies are
designed specifically for three type of encodings to eliminate the estimation bias between training
and evaluation. We name it SubgraphDrop for dropping subgraphs during training. SubgraphDrop
significantly reduces memory overhead while keeping performance nearly the same as training with
all subgraphs. We first present subgraph sampling strategies, then introduce the designs of aligning
training and evaluation. Fig. 2 in Appendix.A.2 provides a pictorial illustration."

redundant subgraphs to reduce memory overhead. We propose three fast sampling strategies (See
Appendix.A.2) that select subgraphs to evenly cover the whole graph, where each node is covered
by ≈R (redundancy factor) selected subgraphs; R is a hyperparameter used as a sampling stopping
condition. Then, GNN-AK(+)-S (with Sampling) has roughly R times the overhead of base model
(R≤3 in practice). We remark that our subsampling strategies are randomized and fast, which are
both desired characteristics for an online Dropout-like sampling in training."

differ across training epochs, preserving most information due to amortization. On the other hand,
it makes it difficult for the three encodings during training to align with full-mode evaluation. Next,
we propose an alignment procedure for each type of encoding."

are resource-demanding. Sampling with SubgraphDrop enables training using practical resources.
Notably, GNN-AK+-S models, shown at the end of Table 3, do not compromise and can even im-
prove performance as compared to their non-sampled counterpart, in alignment with Dropout’s ben-
efits Srivastava et al. (2014). Next we evaluate resource-savings, specifically on ZINC-12K and
CIFAR10. Table 4 shows that GIN-AK+-S with varying R provides an effective handle to trade off
resources with performance. Importantly, the rate in which performance decays with smaller R is
much lower than the rates at which runtime and memory decrease."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.39335180055401664,"Our work introduces a new, general-purpose framework called GNN-As-Kernel (GNN-AK) to uplift
the expressiveness of any GNN, with the key idea of employing a base GNN as a kernel on induced
subgraphs of the input graph, generalizing from the star-pattern aggregation of classical MPNNs.
Our approach provides an expressiveness and performance boost, while retaining practical scala-
bility of MPNNs—a highly sought-after middle ground between the two regimes of scalable yet
less-expressive MPNNs and high-expressive yet practically infeasible and poorly-generalizing k-
order designs. We theoretically studied the expressiveness of GNN-AK, provided a concrete design
and the more powerful GNN-AK+, introducing SubgraphDrop for shrinking runtime and memory
footprint. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmark datasets empirically
justified that GNN-AK(+) (i) uplifts base GNN expressiveness for multiple base GNN choices (e.g.
over 1&2-WL for MPNNs, and over 3-WL for PPGN), (ii) which translates to performance gains
with SOTA results on graph-level benchmarks, (iii) while retaining scalability to practical graphs."

ADDITIONAL RELATED WORK"
REFERENCES,0.592797783933518,"Improving Expressiveness of GNNs: Several works other than those mentioned in Sec.1 tackle ex-
pressive GNNs. Murphy et al. (2019) achieve universality by summing permutation-sensitive func-
tions across a combinatorial number of permutations, limiting feasibility. Dasoulas et al. (2020) adds
node indicators to make them distinguishable, but at the cost of an invariant model, while Vignac
et al. (2020) further addresses the invariance problem, but at the cost of quadratic time complexity.
Corso et al. (2020) generalizes MPNN’s default sum aggregator, but is still limited by 1-WL. Beani
et al. (2021) generalizes spatial and spectral aggregation with >1-WL expressiveness, but using
expensive eigendecomposition. Recently, Bodnar et al. (2021b) introduce MPNNs over simplicial
complexes that shares similar expressiveness as GNN-AK. Ying et al. (2021) studies transformer with
above 1-WL expressiveness. Azizian & Lelarge (2021) surveys GNN expressiveness work."
REFERENCES,0.5955678670360111,"Connections to CNN and k-WL: GNN-AK has a similar convolutional structure as CNN, and in
fact historically many spatial GNNs are inspired by CNN; see Wu et al. (2020) for a detailed survey.
The non-Euclidean nature of graphs makes such generalizations non-trivial. MoNet (Monti et al.,
2017) introduces pseudo-coordinates for nodes, while PatchySAN (Niepert et al., 2016) learns to
order and truncate neighboring nodes for convolution purposes. However, both methods aim to
mimic the formulation of the CNN without admitting the inherent difference between graphs and
images. In contrast, GNN-AK, generalizes CNN to graphs with a base GNN kernel, similar to how
a CNN kernel encodes image patches. GNN-AK also shares connections with two variants of k-
WL test algorithms: depth-k 1-dim WL (Cai et al., 1992; Weisfeiler, 1976) and deep WL (Arvind
et al., 2020). The former recursively applies 1-WL to all size-k subgraphs, with slightly weaker
expressiveness than k-WL, and the latter reduces the number of such subgraphs for the k-WL test.
Instead of working on all O(nk) size-k subgraphs, we keep linear scalability by only applying 1-
WL-equivalent MPNNs to O(n) rooted subgraphs."

chosen as a degree-3 regular graph with separator size k + 1, see Corollary 6.5 in Cai et al. (1992))."
REFERENCES,0.778393351800554,"We describe the proposed scheme of constructing the two graphs A and B briefly, for details see
Section 6 in Cai et al. (1992). At high level, this scheme first constructs A by replacing every node
(with degree d) in G by a carefully designed graph Xd, and then rewires two edges in A to its
non-isomorphic counter graph B. Specifically, the small graph Xd = (Vd, Ed) is defined as follows.
Vd =Ad ∪Bd ∪Md, where Ad = {ai|1 ≤i ≤d}, Bd = {bi|1 ≤i ≤d},
and Md = {mS|S ⊆{1, ..., d}, |S| is even}
(11)
Ed ={(mS, ai)|i ∈S} ∪{(mS, bi)|i /∈S}
Hence each vertex v with degree d in G is replaced by a graph X(v) = Xd of size 2d−1 + 2d,
including a “middle” section Md of size 2d−1 and d pairs of vertices (ai, bi) representing “end-
points” of each edge incident with v in the original graph G. Let (u, v) ∈E(G), then two small
graphs X(v) and X(u) in A are connected by the following. Let (au,v, bu,v), (av,u, bv,u) be the pair
of vertices associated with (u, v) in X(u) and X(v) respectively, then au,v is connected to av,u,
and bu,v is connected to bv,u. After constructing A, B is modified from A by rewiring a single
edge (u, v) in the original graph G. Specifically, now in B, au,v is connected to bv,u and bu,v is
connected to av,u. Cai et al. (1992) proved that A and B are non-isomorphic, and when base graph
G is a degree-3 regular graph with separator size k + 1, A and B are not distinguishable by k-WL.

than 3. Let mS be one middle node connected with ai. We construct a new set S′ = {p, q}, with
p ̸= i, p ∈S and q /∈S, then mS′ connects with bi based on Eq.11. Additionally, ap connects
to both mS and mS′, which implies the shortest path distance between ai and bi ≤4. Hence, the
shortest path distance between ai and bi is exactly 4. To show the diameter of Xd is 4, it’s easy to
observe that distance(ai, bi) only decreases when replacing ai with other nodes in Xd (or reverse,
replacing bi with other nodes in Xd)."

that when t = 4, the two additional nodes outside X3[N3(ai)] and X3[N3(bi)] does not affect-
ing applying Lemma 7. Last, the combination of the isomorphism between Aleft[Nt(au,v)] and
Bleft[Nt(au,v)] and the isomorphism between Aright[Nt(au,v)] and Bright[Nt(au,v)] is actually
a new isomorphism between A[Nt(au,v)] and B[Nt(au,v)], as the edge (au,v, av,u) is mapped

Thus, when t ≤4, A[Nt(au,v)] and B[Nt(au,v)] are isomorphic and

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP DETAILS"
REFERENCES,0.8642659279778393,"To reduce the search space, we search hyperparameters in a two-phase approach: First, we search
common ones (hidden size from [64, 128], number of layers L from [2,4,5,6], (sub)graph pooling
from [SUM, MEAN] for each dataset using GIN based on validation performance, and fix it for any
other GNN and GNN-AK(+). While hyperparameters may not be optimal for other GNN models, the
evaluation is fair as there is no benefit for GNN-AK(+). Next, we search GNN-AK(+) exclusive ones
(encoding types) over validation set using GIN-AK(+) and keep them fixed for other GNN-AK(+).
We use a 1-layer base model for GNN-AK(+), with exceptions that we tune number of layers of base
model (while keeping total number of layers fixed) for GNN-AK in simulation datasets (presented
in Table 1). We use 3-hop egonets for GNN-AK(+), with exceptions that CIFAR10 uses 2-hop
egonet due to memory constraint; PATTERN and RDT-B use random walk based subgraph with
walk length=10 and repeat times=5 as their graphs are dense. For GNN-AK(+)-S, R = 3 is set as
default. We use farthest sampling for molecular datasets ZINC, MolHIV, and MolPCBA; to speed
up further, random sampling is used for CIFAR10 whose graphs are k-NN graphs; min-set-cover
sampling is used for PATTERN to adapt random walk based subgraph. We use Batch Normalization
and ReLU activation in all models. For optimization we use Adam with learning rate 0.001 and"

ent combinations of removing context encoding and D2C, shown in Table 8. Note that all experi-

REFERENCES,0.9058171745152355,"• For real-world datasets (ZINC-12K, CIFAR10), We observe that the largest performance improve-
ment over base model comes from wrapping base GNN with Eq.2 (the performance of GIN-AK),
while adding context encoding and D2C monotonically improves performance of GNN-AK+.
• For substructure counting and graph property regression tasks, we observe D2C significantly in-
creases the performance of GIN-AK+ w/o Ctx (supported by the theory of Subgraph-1-WL where
the HASH is required to be injective). Specifically, the cost-free D2C feature enhances the expres-
siveness of the base 1-layer GIN model (similar to the benefit of distance encoding shown in Li
et al. (2020)), resulting in a more expressive GNN-AK+, which lies between Subgraph-1-WL and
Subgraph-1-WL∗. We leave the exact theoretical analysis of D2C’s expressiveness benefit in fu-
ture work. Notice that GIN-AK improves the performance over the base model but not in a large
margin, we next show this is due to the insufficiency of the number of layers of base GIN."

discriminative enough for subgraphs in the dataset, and without expressiveness bottleneck of
base model, increasing GNN-AK+’s depth benefits expressiveness, akin to increasing iterations
of Subgraph-1-WL. Besides, unlike counting substructure that needs local information within
subgraphs, regressing graph properties needs the graph’s global information which can only be
accessed with increasing GNN-AK+’s (outer) depth.
• Secondly, GNN-AK(+) without D2C suffers from a trade-off between the base model’s expressive-
ness (depth of base model) and the number of GNN-AK(+) layers (outer depth), which is clearly
observed in regressing graph properties. We hypothesize that without D2C the 1-layer GIN base
model is not discriminative enough for subgraphs in the dataset, and with this bottleneck of base
model, GNN-AK(+) cannot benefit from increasing the outer depth. Hence the number of layers
of the base model are important for the expressiveness of GNN-AK(+) when D2C is not used."
