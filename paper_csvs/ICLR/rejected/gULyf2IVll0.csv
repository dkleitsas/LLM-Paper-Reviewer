ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.004405286343612335,"In general, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are evaluated by the generalization
performance measured on unseen data excluded from the training phase. Along
with the development of DNNs, the generalization performance converges to the
state-of-the-art and it becomes difﬁcult to evaluate DNNs solely based on this
metric. The robustness against adversarial attack has been used as an additional
metric to evaluate DNNs by measuring their vulnerability. However, few studies
have been performed to analyze the adversarial robustness in terms of the geome-
try in DNNs. In this work, we perform an empirical study to analyze the internal
properties of DNNs that affect model robustness under adversarial attacks. In par-
ticular, we propose the novel concept of the Populated Region Set (PRS), where
trained samples are populated more frequently, to represent the internal properties
of DNNs in a practical setting. From systematic experiments with the proposed
concept, we provide empirical evidence to validate that a low PRS ratio has a
strong relationship with the adversarial robustness of DNNs."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.013215859030837005,"With the steep improvement of the performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), their applica-
tions are expanding to the real world, such as autonomous driving and healthcare (LeCun et al.,
2015; Miotto et al., 2018; Huang & Chen, 2020). For real world application, it may be necessary to
choose the best model among the candidates. Traditionally, the generalization performance which
measures the objective score on the test dataset excluded in the training phase, is used to evaluate
the models (Bishop, 2006). However, it is non-trivial to evaluate DNNs based on this single metric.
For example, if two networks with the same structure have the similar test accuracy, it is ambiguous
which is better."
INTRODUCTION,0.01762114537444934,"Robustness against adversarial attacks, measure of the vulnerability, can be an alternative to evaluate
DNNs (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Gu & Rigazio, 2014; Huang et al., 2015;
Jakubovitz & Giryes, 2018; Yuan et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2021). Adversarial attacks aim to induce
model misprediction by perturbing the input with small magnitude. Most previous works were
focused on the way to ﬁnd adversarial samples by utilizing the model properties such as gradients
with respect to the loss function. Given that the adversarial attack seeks to ﬁnd the perturbation path
on the model prediction surface over the input space, robustness can be expressed in terms of the
geometry of the model. However, few studies have been performed to interpret the robustness with
the concept of the geometric properties of DNNs."
INTRODUCTION,0.022026431718061675,"From a geometric viewpoint, the internal properties of DNNs are represented by the boundaries and
the regions (Baughman & Liu, 2014). It is shown that the DNNs with piece-wise linear activation
layers are composed of many linear regions, and the maximal number of these regions is mathe-
matically related to the expressivity of DNNs (Mont´ufar et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2020). As these
approaches only provide the upper bound for the expressivity with the same structured model, it
does not explain how much information the model actually expresses."
INTRODUCTION,0.02643171806167401,"In this work, we investigate the relationship between the internal properties of DNNs and the ro-
bustness. In particular, our approach analyzes the internal characteristics from the perspective of the
decision boundary (DB) and the decision region (DR), which are basic components of DNNs (Fawzi
et al., 2017). To avoid insensitivity of the maximal number of linear regions in the same structure
assumption, we propose the novel concept of the Populated Region Set (PRS), which is a set of DRs"

veals the vulnerability of DNNs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), is mainly used to validate the reliability of
the trained network. As an early stage for adversarial attacks, the fast gradient sign method (FGSM)
(Goodfellow et al., 2014) based on the gradient with respect to the loss function and the multi-step
iterative method (Kurakin et al., 2016) are proposed to create adversarial examples to change the
model prediction with a small perturbation. Recently, many studies on effective attacks in various
settings (e.g., white-box or black-box) have been performed to understand the undesirable decision
of the networks (Shaham et al., 2018; Madry et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020). In terms of factors

between the learning rate and batch size does not degrade the model robustness even with a large
batch size as it converges to the ﬂatter minima."
RELATED WORK,0.1277533039647577,"Geometric Analysis inside Deep Neural Networks
With increasing interest in the expressive
power of DNNs, there have been several attempts to analyze DNNs from a geometric perspective
(Dauphin et al., 2014; Choromanska et al., 2015). In these studies, the characteristics of the decision
boundary or regions formulated by the DNNs are mainly discussed. Mont´ufar et al. (2014) show
that the cascade of the linear layer and the nonlinear activation organizes the numerous piece-wise
linear regions. They show that the complexity of the decision boundary is related to the maximal
number of these linear regions, which is determined by the depth and the width of the model. Xiong
et al. (2020) extend the notion of the linear region to the convolutional layers and show the better
geometric efﬁciency of the convolutional layers. Fawzi et al. (2018) reveal that classiﬁcation regions
in DNNs are topologically connected and the decision boundary of natural images is ﬂat in most
directions. It has also been shown that the manifolds learned by DNNs and the distributions over
them are highly related to the representation capability of a network (Lei et al., 2018). While these
studies highlight the beneﬁts of increasing expressivity of DNNs as the number of regions increases,
interpreting the vulnerability of DNNs with the geometry is another important topic. Yang et al.
(2020) show that a model with thick decision boundaries induces robustness. Moosavi-Dezfooli
et al. (2019) show that a decision boundary with a small curvature acquires the high robustness of
the model. These approaches focus on the decision boundaries, while this paper suggests to focus
on the decision regions, which are composed by the surrounding decision boundaries."

INTERNAL PROPERTY OF DNNS,0.13656387665198239,"This section describes the internal properties of DNNs from the perspective of decision boundaries
(DBs) and regions (DRs). The DBs of the DNN classiﬁer is mainly deﬁned as the borderline between
DRs for classiﬁcation, where the prediction probability of class i and the neighboring class j are the
same (Fawzi et al., 2018). To expand the notion of DBs and DRs to the internal feature-level, we re-
deﬁne the DBs in the classiﬁer that generalizes the existing deﬁnition of DBs. We then propose the
novel concept of the Populated Region (PR) that describes the speciﬁc DRs used from the network
for training samples. PR is used to analyze the relationship between the trained parameters and the
characteristics of networks."

the ratio of success samples (light green bar), failure samples with non-zero gradient (blue bar) and
zero gradient (red bar) in all samples. We note that the failed attack samples with non-zero gradients
maintain the index of the largest logit as the true class after attack. To analyze the reason of failure,
we examine the change of the logits under the adversarial attack. This change is shown in Figure
6 (b). To clarify the difference of the change of the logits between Network A and B, we select
the examples of successful attack on Network A but failed attack on Network B. In Network B, the
logits move on almost parallel direction, which causes the predicted label to be maintained as the
true class."
PRS AND FINAL LAYER,0.40969162995594716,"To explain the parallel change of the logit vector, we hypothesize that the DBs corresponding to
each class node have similar conﬁguration in the input space. However, it is intractable to measure
the similarity between DBs in the entire network due to the highly non-linear structure and the high
dimensional input space. To simplify our hypothesis, we only measure the cosine similarity between
the parameters which map the features on the penultimate layer to logits (i.e., ﬁnal layer). Figure 7
presents that the similarity matrices for Networks A and B. When we compare the matrix between
the two models at the 300th epoch, we identify that Network B (low PRS ratio) has greater cosine
similarity between each parameter in the ﬁnal layer. We note that the cosine similarity between each
parameter in the ﬁnal layer can be considered as the degree of parallelism for the normal vectors in
the linear classiﬁer. We also conﬁrm that the decrease of the PRS ratio is aligned with the increase
of the similarity of parameters in the Figure 7 (b), when we consider the graph in Figure 2. To verify
the relationship between PRS ratio and the cosine similarity between the parameters in the ﬁnal
layer, we measure the PRS ratio and the cosine similarity between each parameter in all models.
Figure 8 shows the experiment results grouped according to the model structure. We identify that"

visualize the feature maps directly for each depth of layers. Figure 11 shows illustrative examples
of feature maps. We identify that the model with the low PRS ratio learns more sparse features
compared to the model with the high PRS ratio. As the sparse features are considered as an inde-
pendent and informative representation (Ranzato et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007), if the PRS ratio can
cause sparse feature representation in various cases, we conclude that the PRS ratio is related to the
informative features. To verify our hypothesis, we measure the trend between the PRS ratio and the

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.8237885462555066,"In this work, we perform an empirical study to analyze the internal properties of DNNs, which
affect the robustness under adversarial attacks. We propose the novel concept populated region set
to derive the relationship between the internal properties of DNNs and robustness in a practical
setting. From systematic experiments for the proposed concept, we suggest that the PRS ratio is
related to the robustness of DNNs and provide empirical evidence of this relationship: (1) The
network with the a low PRS ratio shows high robustness against the gradient-based attack compared
to the network with a high PRS ratio. In particular, the model with a low PRS ratio has a higher
degree of parallelism for the parameters in the ﬁnal layer, which can support robustness. (2) The
network with a low PRS ratio includes more test samples in the training PR. We empirically verify
that this inclusion ratio is related to robustness from the observation that included test samples are
more robust than excluded test samples. (3) The network with a low PRS ratio learns sparse feature
representation to solve tasks. Moreover its global feature representation is more intensive than the
network with a high PRS ratio."
