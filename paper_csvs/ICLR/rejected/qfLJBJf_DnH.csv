ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.002178649237472767,"We study the problem of learning dynamics that can produce hierarchically or-
ganized continuous outputs consisting of the ﬂexible chaining of re-usable motor
motifs from which complex behavior is generated. Can a motif library be efﬁ-
ciently and extendably learned without interference between motifs, and can these
motifs be chained in arbitrary orders without ﬁrst learning the corresponding mo-
tif transitions during training? This requires (i) parameter updates while learning
a new motif that do not interfere with the parameters used for the previously ac-
quired ones; and (ii) successful motif generation when starting from the network
states reached at the end of any of the other motifs, even if these states were not
present during training (a case of out-of-distribution generalization). We meet the
ﬁrst requirement by designing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with speciﬁc ar-
chitectures that segregate motif-dependent parameters (as customary in continual
learning works), and try a standard method to address the second by training with
random initial states. We ﬁnd that these standard RNNs are very unreliable during
zero-shot transfer to motif chaining. We then use insights from the motor thalam-
ocortical circuit, featuring a speciﬁc module that shapes motif transitions. We de-
velop a method to constrain the RNNs to function similarly to the thalamocortical
circuit during motif transitions, while preserving the large expressivity afforded
by gradient-based training of non-analytically tractable RNNs. We then show that
this thalamocortical inductive bias not only acts in synergy with gradient-descent
RNN training to improve accuracy during in-training-distribution motif produc-
tion, but also leads to zero-shot transfer to new motif chains with no performance
cost. Besides proposing an efﬁcient, robust and ﬂexible RNN architecture, our
results shed new light on the function of motor preparation in the brain."

INTRODUCTION AND RELATION TO OTHER WORKS,0.006535947712418301,"Animals have the remarkable ability to efﬁciently learn and compose elaborate continuous behav-
iors, which often relies on the ﬂexible chaining of ‘motifs’ - reproducible bouts of behavior - in
response to hierarchical commands (Zimnik & Churchland, 2021; Geddes et al., 2018; Merel et al.,
2019b). The mechanisms behind this are however not fully understood, and engineering controllers
for dynamical systems that could perform such complex and structured continuous behaviors in the
real world has been a long-standing challenge of robotics (Brooks, 1986; Prescott et al., 1999; Merel
et al., 2019b). Such tasks involve two different computational operations: ﬁrst, at coarse temporal
intervals, the ﬂexible selection of discrete and abstract action commands by a ‘high-level controller’;
and, second, the transmission of each abstract command to a ‘lower-level controller’ that continu-
ously produces a corresponding command - a ‘motif’ - for the motor effector."
INTRODUCTION AND RELATION TO OTHER WORKS,0.008714596949891068,"Many lines of work have used artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) to solve the ﬁrst - discrete - compu-
tational operation (notably using tools from deep reinforcement learning, e.g. (Merel et al., 2019a;
Frans et al., 2018; Dennis et al., 2020)) and have leveraged the ability of ANNs to perform well
when using a rich training set that includes many motif sequences (Frans et al., 2018; Dennis et al.,
2020; OpenAI et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2020). However, to the best of our knowledge, in the context of
the second computational operation, there is a gap in the literature about how to design ANN mecha-
nisms that enable zero-shot transfer to performing new continuous motif sequences from a library of"

markable human skill, as we can - for instance - learn to pronounce a new word and then immediately
include it in arbitrary sentences. While this biological relevance has led the neuroscience community
to start investigating related questions, this literature has focused on a hand-designed ‘bottom-up’
approach. This approach studies how networks can function in spite of strong constraints introduced
e.g. to mimic the brain activity patterns or connectivity, and/or to ensure analytical tractability (Kao
et al., 2020; Logiaco et al., 2019; Sussillo et al., 2015; Zimnik & Churchland, 2021; Ijspeert et al.,
2013; Kulvicius et al., 2012). Importantly, this approach cannot determine whether speciﬁc network
features are more generally advantageous for solving a task - instead, with this bottom-up approach,
these chosen features could reﬂect constraints that arose through random evolutionary idiosyncra-
cies, or could become irrelevant for networks that cannot be designed through analytical insights but
that can still be successfully trained with modern machine learning algorithms. Overcoming these
limitations has implications for engineering and can provide new neuroscientiﬁc insight."
INTRODUCTION AND RELATION TO OTHER WORKS,0.015250544662309368,"To address this knowledge gap, here, we use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) whose computa-
tional power is not arbitrarily constrained. An RNN is a type of ANN which is a generic dynamical
system, and which therefore naturally ﬁts the desired characteristics of motor outputs. Consequently,
ANNs are indeed regularly used for tasks requiring the production of continuous outputs, including
in the context of robotics (Wyffels & Schrauwen, 2009; Sussillo & Abbott, 2009; Tani, 2003; Liu
et al., 2019; Merel et al., 2019a; Maheswaranathan et al., 2019). We will examine the ability of
RNNs to (i) independently learn motor motifs in order to to build a continuously expandable motif
library; and (ii) ﬂexibly chain motifs in arbitrary orders (Fig. 1a and see Appendix A.1 for a formal
deﬁnition). In order to better dissect the mechanisms by which RNNs can fail or succeed at this task,
we focus on the purest form of motor control through dynamics: the production of trajectories with-
out needing the external anchor of a time-dependent sensory input. We refer to this as autonomous
control, which is especially relevant when sensory input is too unreliable (Yeo et al., 2016; Shenoy
et al., 2013; Brembs, 2021), but also in other cases such as the above-mentioned speech production.
We will show that while it is possible to engineer RNNs to independently, extendably and efﬁciently
learn to produce single motifs in response to discrete input commands, these RNNs are limited in
their generalization ability during improvisation of motif sequences. We will then use insights from
the mammalian thalamocortical motor system - notably the presence of a motor preparation phase
before each motif (Zimnik & Churchland, 2021; Nashef et al., 2021; Logiaco et al., 2019). We will
show that weaving in these insights into performance-optimized RNNs leads to both improved mo-
tif production accuracy (through a positive synergy with single motif gradient-descent training) and
excellent robustness during generalization to motif sequencing."

TASK AND ARCHITECTURE DESIGN"
TASK AND ARCHITECTURE DESIGN,0.0196078431372549,"Here, we study the ability of RNNs to fulﬁll the ﬁrst requirement of our task: the ability to acquire
an extendable library of autonomous motifs (Fig. 1a, left column). However, before describing these
analyses, we want to clarify how we chose the motifs that the RNNs have to learn. First, we chose
motifs of long durations – on the order of a thousand timesteps – so that they strongly leverage the
above-mentioned autonomous capabilities of RNNs. Second, because we are interested in assessing
the relative expressive power of the RNNs we study, we have designed two different types of mo-
tor motifs so that they constitute two ‘difﬁculty’ levels for the RNNs. Following recent analytical
approaches for studying RNN dynamics (Schuessler et al., 2020b;a; Logiaco et al., 2019), we char-
acterize the difﬁculty of motifs as the number of certain basis functions - complex exponentials that
act similarly as different frequencies of a Fourier transform - needed to approximate a motif well
through linear combination. Therefore, we deﬁne a set of oscillatory motifs that are relatively easy
to produce, and a set of more difﬁcult ‘step’ motifs (Fig. 1d,f-g, see Appendix A.2 for the full list of
motifs used in this paper). We train motifs using gradient descent – speciﬁcally, ADAM (Kingma &
Ba, 2015)). Our objective function is the mean square error between desired and actual output."
TASK AND ARCHITECTURE DESIGN,0.02178649237472767,"We will now study how RNNs can meet the requirement to learn a new motif without ‘catastrophic
interference’ with the memory of previously learned motifs - which relates to the literature on con-
tinual learning (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Parisi et al., 2019; Yoon et al., 2020; Farajtabar et al.,
2019). This line of work emphasizes avoiding interference between gradient updates used to train
a network on many sub-tasks, while promoting the re-use of neural resources across sub-tasks (so
that the network makes efﬁcient use of its parameters). We will use an ‘architectural’ approach to"

it will later facilitate the weaving of biological insights in our networks. With this approach, in-
terference is fully prevented during sequential learning; but the proposed architectures may not be
efﬁcient, which is what we investigate below. To do so, we will compare these architectures to a
‘standard’ RNN with no segregation of tuned parameters. This RNN (‘control architecture’) (i) is
fully-tuned, (ii) receives a static input bµ to instruct the motif µ (Maheswaranathan et al., 2019;
Sussillo & Abbott, 2009; Tani, 2003), and (iii) is trained in a plausible noise-robust regime imposed
by a random initialization of its state (see A.6.3). As expected given that this RNN has no protection
against catastrophic interference (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017), we indeed ﬁnd that when learning motifs
sequentially, this RNN immediately forgets previously learned motifs when learning a new one (not
shown) – even though it is possible to learn motifs by simultaneously including all of them in each
training batch (Fig. 1c, and see below). This ‘control architecture’ obeys the following dynamics:"

adjust the shared recurrent weights through tuning their above-mentioned gain hyperparameter g (a
similar alternative could be to pre-tune these recurrent weights to an original set of motifs and to
then freeze them, but - as we will see - our chosen approach leads to good results)."
TIMESCALES,0.11328976034858387,"First, we consider an ‘additive’ architecture (Fig. 1b, top). Here, each motif µ is produced in re-

dynamics would not be affected by learning."

the brain’s motor system (Guo et al., 2017; Logiaco et al., 2019). Here, each motif µ is produced
in response to both a learned input vector bµ and a learned rank-one perturbation of the connec-
tivity uµv⊺
µ. The latter is equivalent to a loop through an instantaneous ‘unit’ receiving input from
the recurrent network through the weights vµ and feeding back through the weights uµ. Here, this
motif-speciﬁc loop participates to modulating the dynamics (Logiaco et al., 2019), in a way that
yields more computational ﬂexibility compared to networks with random feedback weights (Sus-
man et al., 2021). Interestingly, learning the full recurrent weights in randomly initialized RNNs
can yield a low-rank weight update (Schuessler et al., 2020b). Therefore, by imposing that the
motif-speciﬁc learning is restricted to a low-rank weight perturbation, we expect to get close to
full-weight learning while enabling segregation of the learned weights per motif. The dynamics are:"

task – which values limiting the number of parameters that need to be tuned and stored per motif

ANNs, that relies on leveraging randomness (e.g. (Vezhnevets et al., 2017; Liu & Hodgins, 2017;
Merel et al., 2019a)) during training. Each motif is trained in isolation but with initial network ac-
tivities selected randomly according to a distribution that approximates the activities at the ends of
all other motifs (Fig. 1e). In this scenario, if we can approximate the end-of-motifs distribution well
enough and if training succeeds, then all transitions should work with no transition-speciﬁc training.
Unfortunately, the end-of-motifs distribution is unknown, is training-dependent, and could be het-
erogeneous across motifs. However, since we are using networks with large N, Gaussian weights,
and a tanh nonlinearity, it is known that an uncorrelated Gaussian vector can in some cases well-
approximate this unknown distribution (Landau & Sompolinsky, 2018). Indeed, we observed that a
standard normal is a good choice for the marginal statistics (Fig. 2a and b, panels (ii)). Hence, we
tried training the RNNs to generate the step motifs one at a time when starting from random initial

as in training), and found that the performance of the second motif was substantially degraded
compared to the same motif produced when starting from random (Fig. 2a,b panels (i) and (iii);
see also Fig. 1g right). Each transition from a given ﬁrst motif leads to a relatively reproducible
output for the second motif because the network variability is low at the end of the ﬁrst motif.
However the second motif’s output can vary substantially from the target when following certain
ﬁrst motifs. Moreover, the inaccuracies are not restricted to the start of the second motif; rather, the
whole output is either clearly shifted or even more grossly wrong. Note that these issues are also
present in the control architectures and are therefore not caused by our strategy of segregating the
tuned parameters per motif to tackle catastrophic interference (Fig. 2c, Appendix A.3.5)."
BRITTLENESS OF STANDARD RNNS DURING GENERALIZATION,0.19172113289760348,"Interestingly, the shape of the marginal distribution of the elements of x at the end of a given motif
µ (xµ
end) was not a good predictor of whether transitions from this motif would lead to worse perfor-
mance. For instance, in the case of the additive network, the transition from motif 1 to motif 2 leads
to poor performance for motif 2 (Fig. 2a (i), top right), even though the marginal distribution of x1
end
at the end of motif 1 appears extremely similar to a standard Gaussian (Fig. 2a (ii), red curve). Con-
versely the distribution of x5
end at the end of motif 5 is wider than the standard Gaussian (Fig. 2a (ii),
purple curve), but the transition from motif 5 to motif 2 leads to a more accurate output (Fig. 2a (i),

success, which complicates sampling the various xµ

initializing with the standard normal were not due to this mismatch in scale, we retrained our additive
network with initial x values sampled from a Gaussian with std of 1.2 (Fig. 2a panels (iv) and

starting from random improves signiﬁcantly, but zero-shot transfer is again unsuccessful with rela-

Further, even including a few motifs transitions in the training set would disrupt the sequential learn-
ing strategy that prevents the training set to grow over time in a continual learning setting. Indeed, on
the one hand, sequential training would require motif parameters to only be trained for transitioning
from previously learned motifs - which would compromise the robustness of the motifs that were
learned earlier, especially if the motifs’ properties change over the ’life’ of the agent. On the other
hand, re-training earlier-learned motifs to improve their accuracy when they are initialized from

issue would be to train all motifs from a ﬁxed arbitrary network state, and to implement a hard reset
to this state before each motif. However, this strategy would introduce detours at transitions in case
of discrepancy between two motif’s end and start points – and would more generally prevent the
RNN’s dynamics to use the implicit information about the previous motif’s shape encoded into its
internal state in order to implement a smooth transition to the next motif. As a side note, training
single motifs initialized with a reset from a noiseless ﬁxed state would not be noise robust (Fig. 16a),
while using a noisy reset actually corresponds to testing and training our networks on random ini-
tial conditions – and we will show below that, besides introducing detours at transitions, this naive
strategy leads to impaired learning and poorer performance compared to our biologically-inspired
solution. To address these issues, we will now leverage insights from the brain’s motor network.
This is promising because human behavior demonstrates that the brain has acquired inductive biases
that enable zero-shot motor sequence improvisation with agile transitions between motifs."

BRAIN-INSPIRED INDUCTIVE BIASES IMPROVE ACCURACY & ROBUSTNESS,0.2113289760348584,"Recordings from the brain’s motor cortex during ﬂexible sequencing indicate that a period of mo-
tor preparation precedes every motif in a sequence (Zimnik & Churchland, 2021). This preparation
leads the activity to quickly converge towards a motif-speciﬁc pattern (Lara et al., 2018). This motor
preparation process involves interactions between the recurrent motor cortex and thalamus (Nashef
et al., 2021) – a brain region whose neurons quickly respond to cortical input and then projects
back to cortex, forming feedback loops that effectively act as perturbations of the effective cortical
connectivity (Kao et al., 2020; Logiaco et al., 2019). In a computationally limited linear regime,
previous work has shown that this preparatory perturbation can be linked to the optimal control so-
lution to bring the cortical activity towards the unique motif-speciﬁc stable state instructed by an
external input provided to cortex (Kao et al., 2020; Logiaco et al., 2019). However, the dynamics of
the continuously nonlinear RNNs that we and modern ML practitioners consider (Maheswaranathan
et al., 2019; Wyffels & Schrauwen, 2009; Sussillo & Abbott, 2009; Tani, 2003; Liu et al., 2019;
Merel et al., 2019a) are richer and qualitatively different from this linear regime, and do not allow
setting the parameters through analytics as done in the former neuroscience works (Kao et al., 2020;
Logiaco et al., 2019). Indeed, in this limited linear regime, (i) single motifs could not be produced in
response to a simple static input (Logiaco et al., 2019) – whereas the RNNs can (Fig. 2); (ii) spon-
taneous activity decays to zero, whereas units are spontaneously active in our networks (Fig. 3b,
‘prior learning’ curves, (Sompolinsky et al., 1988)); and (iii) a single stable ﬁxed point exists, while
continuously nonlinear RNNs can exhibit multistability (Maheswaranathan et al., 2019). Therefore,
it is unclear whether such a preparatory connectivity perturbation can be successfully trained with
gradient descent to shape a convergence phase in the more powerful performance-optimized contin-
uously nonlinear RNNs. Also, to draw conclusions about the functionality and applicability of the
preparatory connectivity perturbation, it is critical to determine whether it can act in synergy with
gradient descent training of the motif-speciﬁc parameters in the continuously nonlinear RNNs. To
answer these questions, we ﬁrst design a training protocol for a preparatory connectivity perturba-
tion (that we call ‘preparatory module’, Fig. 3a left). This training is done once and for all before
learning any motif; details are in A.5.1 and we summarize the procedure below. We want to train the

prep
compared to possible alternative approaches that would only try to match the apparent timecourse of
the neural activity during preparation in the brain (Sussillo et al., 2015; Zimnik & Churchland, 2021).
First, the preparatory loops can modulate the dynamics in a unit-speciﬁc way to create efﬁcient
convergence with a subtle modulation of the RNN connectivity (Fig. 12a,d). This is the reason why
the preparatory input can still interact with the rich RNN’s recurrent connectivity, which allows this
input to shape the output into the desired motif even during preparation. Second, because these loops
are not tuned for any particular motif, they can be optimized once and for all, and do not impose any
additional cost when learning new motifs. Instead, when considering naive ways of setting speciﬁc
dynamics at the beginnings of motifs such as using a second motif-speciﬁc input at the start of each
motif (‘two-inputs’ approach, Fig. 3c), any parameter used for preparation scales with the number
of motifs. We made this ‘two-inputs’ approach comparable to our preparatory module approach by
applying the ﬁrst input the network for the ﬁrst 5τ of the motifs and then a second input during
the remainder of the motif, and by equalizing the number of parameters involved (as we had done
between the additive and multiplicative network) by setting N = 150. We found that this strategy
led to both decreased accuracy and robustness compared to using our preparatory module, with both
effects combining to a large (≈40%) increase in RMSE during transitioning. We could precisely
assess the transitions robustness in these networks this by using an extended motif transition data set
(Fig. 3e). More precisely, we considered transitions between pairs of step motifs where the transition
occurs at fractions of 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0 of the total duration of the ﬁrst motif (e.g. Fig. 3e
right, bottom). This is a more challenging task – that involves a larger variety of network states
from which to transition than before (then, we only considered the 100% scenario where all motifs
ended at the same value: zero). For these transitions, the ‘two-inputs’ network showed a signiﬁcant
increase in error – including occasional very large errors for some transitions, see Appendix A.5.2 –
compared to initializing motifs with the randomness used during training. In contrast, the additive
network had equally robust performance in both conditions (Fig. 3f). Thus, our results argue that
using brain insights to constrain the architectures of networks has advantages, even beyond taking
inspiration from the biological activity patterns (Li et al., 2019; Sinz et al., 2019; Zador, 2019)."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.30501089324618735,"We found that when trained on many randomly initialized single motifs, gradient-trained nonlinear
RNNs struggle during zero-shot transfer to new sequence orders. This is relatively surprising given
that such RNNs are known to be able to learn attractive trajectories (Laje & Buonomano, 2013;
Sussillo & Abbott, 2009; Pollock & Jazayeri, 2020). This suggests that training mostly constrains
the readout dimension in our setting. This is both a blessing - as it is the ultimate reason why dif-
ferent motifs can efﬁciently share parameters and thus beneﬁt from a common dynamical baseline
that is only partially modulated, without being hurt by irrelevant aspects of the dynamics (Logiaco
et al., 2019; Russo et al., 2018) - and a curse as it makes ﬂexible motif chaining difﬁcult. In this
context, we show that using a preparatory module whose architecture is brain-inspired and who im-
poses a dynamics that mimics motor cortical activity during hierarchical motor sequencing (Zimnik
& Churchland, 2021) can efﬁciently enable zero-shot transfer to new sequence orders. Even more
surprisingly, introducing the preparatory module in the nonlinear RNNs actually sizably improves
single motif training such that the motifs are also more accurate during training conditions. These
results reveal a general function for motor preparation speciﬁcally for ﬂexible chaining of motor
motifs, and show that it is not a byproduct of arbitrary biological hardware constraints or of the
restricting assumptions made by previous models to allow for analytical tractability (Logiaco et al.,
2019; Kao et al., 2020). Therefore, ultimately, for the application to robotics control - at least in a
context where intrinsic dynamics matter (Liu et al., 2019; Yeo et al., 2016) - this preparatory module
could be very useful (i) to increase accuracy, (ii) to enable smooth transitions governed by dynamics
that can be tuned to avoid passing through undesirable states, and (iii) to offer a mechanism for
learning appropriate transition times by gradient descent - which are all current challenges for state-
of-the-art networks (Merel et al., 2019a;b). In addition, our approach is extendable to combining
recurrent dynamics - useful in contexts where sensory feedback is not fully reliable (Yeo et al., 2016;
Liu et al., 2019) - with corrections driven by sensory inputs (Guo et al., 2019). Our work therefore
joins several recent calls outlining the need to infuse ANNs with more expert domain knowledge in
order to achieve good generalization in real-world scenarios involving out-of-distribution general-
ization and zero-shot transfer (Russin et al., 2019; D’Amour et al., 2020; Zador, 2019)."

we are trying to limit the number of tuned parameters per motif NV (table 1). This is important
for our networks to constitute viable solutions that can be built on for designing motor controllers,

used consists in a random initialization of the network state, and this noise then propagates to later

COMPARING THE THALAMIC TRANSITION NETWORK TO OTHER WAYS OF
IMPLEMENTING A DIFFERENT DYNAMICAL REGIME AT TRANSITIONS"
DT,0.8605664488017429,"In the main text, at the end of section 4, we gave statistics about a comparison between using
transition module described above and an alternative approach for setting the RNN in a different
dynamical state at the beginning of a motif. More speciﬁcally, we considered a ‘two-inputs’ ap-
proach where we use a ﬁrst motif-speciﬁc input during the ﬁrst 5τ of each motif to try to facilitate
transitions, and a second motif-speciﬁc input during the rest of the motif to facilitate the production
of the motif by the network."
DT,0.8627450980392157,"Following the general approach in our article which adjusts the number of parameters tuned per
motif (main text table 1), we set the size of the recurrent network to N = 150 so that the two inputs
together lead to 300 parameters tuned per motif (and therefore 3000 parameters tuned in total when
learning the ten motifs)."
DT,0.8649237472766884,"We used an extended data set consisting of transitions between pairs of step motifs where the tran-
sition occurs at 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% of the total duration of the ﬁrst motif. This is
a more challenging task than before when we only considered the 100% scenario because all motifs
end at the same value (zero). As stated in the main text, we found that the ‘two-input’ network
did not perform as well as the matched additive network with a transition module (as described in
the previous subsection of the Appendix, this module is not tuned to particular motifs, so the size
of the recurrent network is here simply N = 300 to match the per-motif parameter count with the
‘two-input’ network)."
DT,0.8671023965141612,"In Fig. 14, we show examples for the single-motif performance of the ‘two-input’ network and the
matched additive network, when transitioning from 70% vs. 100% of the duration of the previous
motif (the latter one being the same situation as considered elsewhere in this work)."
DT,0.869281045751634,"Examining Fig. 14 reveals that the ‘two-inputs’ network behaves differently from the additive net-
work in two major ways. First, its overall motif accuracy is lower; and second, when transitioning
from 70% of the duration of the previous motif, their accuracy consistently decreased compared to
when initializing the motif at random as during training. This decrease in accuracy was seen consis-
tently when transitioning in all scenarios when the previous motifs interrupted before their ending
(which is zero-padded). This is probably because the larger variability of network outputs when
interrupting motifs is reﬂected in a larger variability of network states. Importantly, the additive net-
work with a transition module could handle this variability to allow the network to produce a more
accurate output when chaining an interrupted motif with a subsequent one."
DT,0.8714596949891068,"These results strongly suggest that ‘engineering’ a ﬁxed point in the dynamics at the start of motifs
(at a position that is adjusted with a preparatory input) is a particularly potent way of ensuring
accurate and robust motif performance. In addition, close to a ﬁxed point (which is presumably a
good description of the dynamical regime close to the end of the preparatory period), the dynamics
is quasi-linear, in which case classical results from control theory indicate that feedback loops such
as those of the transition module are the optimal strategy to steer the network towards its target.
Therefore, these results further strengthen our conclusion that the transition module we propose is a
particularly potent strategy for zero-shot transfer during motif chaining."

identity of the prior motif (as labeled in the panel ’when starting from random’ - where the motifs

the various output values at the moment when the ﬁrst motif is interrupted, and the readout value
at the start of the next motif, without having to make a detour through a ﬁxed readout value (as
would occur if the networks were reset to a ﬁxed – i.e., non motif-speciﬁc – state before each motif).
In the additive network, this is because the preparatory module directly drives the RNN from its
state at the moment when the ﬁrst motif is interrupted, to a state speciﬁc to the second motif (and
instructed by the motif-speciﬁc preparatory input) that corresponds to the readout at the end of the

DIFFERENCES IN LEARNING CURVES BETWEEN THE ADDITIVE AND THE

networks matched in number of tuned parameters (by ﬁxing the size of the additive network to
N = 300 and the size of the multiplicative network to N = 100) suggests that they lead to simi-
lar errors on average when trained to produce the step motifs (main text Fig.1c). Interestingly, we
observed that these similar performances were typically reached through different types of learning
curves (Fig. 15): the multiplicative networks tend to show discontinuous steps in the learning curve,
whereas the additive networks typically have smooth learning curves. This suggests that the per-
formance of the multiplicative networks may be limited by the ability of gradient descent to fully
optimize these networks to their best possible performance. In the future, it would be interesting to
investigate ways of improving the optimization of the multiplicative networks - for instance using
motif-speciﬁc learning rate schedules, or by increasing its size to N = 300 while only training one-
third of the weights of the loop and input vectors (so that it has as many untuned parameters as the

ADDING NOISE DURING TRAINING IS NECESSARY TO GET NOISE-ROBUST NETWORKS"

DT,0.9193899782135077,"Second, for more general applications of the current framework to motor control in the real world,
the dynamics often need to be modulated by sensory input – which is never perfectly reliable. In
particular, the triggering of motif transitions is likely to often depend on sensory input."
DT,0.9215686274509803,"For these reasons, we imposed noise robustness through a relatively large noise at motif start, imple-
mented through a random initialization of the state of the network: at each run, the initial activities
x are sampled iid from a Gaussian distribution. Importantly, because of the recurrent dynamics, the
initial noise is also propagating at later times through the recurrent dynamics. Additionally, in most
of our simulations - including all the simulations with our preparatory module - we added a small
(Gaussian with std = 0.001) amount of noise to the dynamics at each timestep."
DT,0.9237472766884531,"Here, we show that the inclusion of noise is indeed necessary for getting noise-robust solutions
(Fig. 16), illustrating this for additive networks. When training networks on single motifs initialized
from the origin without noise - as opposed to adding Gaussian noise to the origin as we did in the
main text - testing the networks with small amounts of noise leads to unreliable network outputs
(Fig. 16 a, second column). In contrast, a network trained on motifs initialized from a standard
Gaussian as a more reliable output across a range of standard deviation of the initialization (Fig. 16
b, ﬁrst three columns). Finally, we note that while training the vanilla additive network without
noise yields a higher accuracy in the noiseless conditions compared to a vanilla RNN handicapped
by the requirement of noise robustness during training (Fig. 16 a left vs. Fig. 16 b left), even in
these noiseless initialization conditions the vanilla additive network does not perform better than an
additive network with a preparatory period and a noisy initialization (Fig. 16 a left vs Fig. 12c)."

generalization to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution perturbations, they also do it at no ac-

trials across all standard deviations of the random initialization (b, ﬁrst three columns). Note that
while training the vanilla additive network without noise yields a higher accuracy in the noiseless
conditions compared to a vanilla RNN handicapped by the requirement of noise robustness during
training (a left vs. b left), even in these noiseless initialization conditions the vanilla additive network
does not perform better than an additive network with a preparatory period with a noisy initialization
(a left vs. Fig. 12c). Color conventions as in Fig. 6. Standard ADAM parameters with a learning

DT,0.954248366013072,"Here, we give more evidence of this by examining the learning dynamics of the networks with
or without a preparatory module. We ﬁnd that networks trained with a preparatory module and
standard Gaussian initialization reach a performance plateau faster (Fig. 17). Interestingly, not only
is this true compared to training without a preparatory module with the same a standard Gaussian
initialization (Fig. 17 a middle and right; and Fig. 17 b), but is is also true when compared to training
without a preparatory module from a noiseless origin (Fig. 17 a left)."
DT,0.9564270152505446,"Taken together, our results strongly argue that our preparatory module helps network performance
in two ways. First, when training single motifs from a ﬁxed noisy initialization, the fast dynamics
timescales introduced by the preparatory module appear to help the training-induced changes in the
input to drive the exploration of different possible activity states until ﬁnding a motif-speciﬁc one
that leads to particularly accurate motif production (Mohajerin & Waslander, 2019; Kemeth et al.,
2021). Second, it helps ﬁltering out noise and robustly converging to this motif-speciﬁc activity"

DT,0.9607843137254902,"pattern to start motif production. Therefore, the preparatory module helps the network implement
computations that are shared between motifs, and then acts as an inductive bias such that the motif-
speciﬁc parameters can be fully devoted to motif-speciﬁc functions (shape the motif-speciﬁc readout
and ﬁnal activity pattern during the preparatory period, and modulate the network dynamics during
the remainder of motif production for accurate readout). This is why the preparatory module can be
trained once and for all before training any motif speciﬁc parameters, which leads to improvements
in accuracy and robustness at no per-motif cost in terms of tuned parameters and without introducing
any learning interference in a continual learning scenario."
