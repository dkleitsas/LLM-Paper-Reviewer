ABSTRACT,0.0018726591760299626,"Motion time series collected from low-power, always-on mobile and wearable
devices such as smartphones and smartwatches offer significant insights into human
behavioral patterns, with wide applications in healthcare, automation, IoT, and
AR/XR. However, given security and privacy concerns, building large-scale motion
time series datasets remains difficult, hindering the development of pre-trained
models for human activity analysis. Typically, existing models are trained and
tested on the same dataset, leading to poor generalizability across variations in
device location, device mounting orientation, and human activity type. In this
paper, we introduce UniMTS1, the first unified pre-training procedure for motion
time series that generalizes across diverse device latent factors and activities.
Specifically, we employ a contrastive learning framework that aligns motion time
series with text descriptions enriched by large language models. This helps the
model learn the semantics of time series to generalize across activities. Given the
absence of large-scale motion time series data, we derive and synthesize time series
from existing motion skeleton data with all-joint coverage. We use spatio-temporal
graph networks to capture the relationships across joints for generalization across
different device locations. We further design rotation-invariant augmentation to
make the model agnostic to changes in device mounting orientations. Our model
shows exceptional generalizability across 18 motion time series classification
benchmark datasets, outperforming the best baselines by 340% in the zero-shot
setting, 16.3% in the few-shot setting, and 9.2% in the full-shot setting."

INTRODUCTION,0.033707865168539325,"Figure 1: Our framework addresses three key generalization challenges (variation in device location,
orientation, and activity) where existing methods fall short."
INTRODUCTION,0.035580524344569285,"While valuable, collecting motion time series data at large scale remains challenging due to security or
privacy concerns. Labeling motion time series proves even more difficult as such data cannot be easily
interpreted by humans for post annotation. This results in data insufficiency that impedes development
of supervised learning methods. In other fields such as natural language processing [39, 56] and
computer vision [44, 30], pre-trained foundation models have shown remarkable performance in such
settings with insufficient data. However, in the motion time series domain, lack of comprehensive
datasets and an effective pre-training task makes it difficult to similarly develop pre-trained models
that can operate with limited data. Typically, existing models perform training and testing on the
same dataset, and struggle to generalize across different datasets given the following three unique
challenges within the motion time series problem domain."
INTRODUCTION,0.03745318352059925,"We summarize these three unique generalization challenges in Figure 1. First of all, variation in
device placement during deployment poses a significant issue; for instance, data from a smartwatch
on the wrist vary considerably from data gathered from a smartphone near the upper leg. Therefore,
models trained on data from one body location can barely generalize to others during the testing
phase. Secondly, devices can experience arbitrary orientations during data collection, making it
difficult for models trained on specific device orientations to adapt to new ones during deployment.
Thirdly, different motion time series datasets can be focused on different types of human activities.
For example, some datasets aim to identify stationary activities such as lying or sitting, while others
concentrate on dynamic movements such as walking or cycling. Models trained on specific types of
activities typically struggle to generalize to new activities introduced by other datasets."
INTRODUCTION,0.03932584269662921,"We introduce UniMTS, the first Unified pre-trained model for Motion Time Series to address all the
above three generalization issues, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot and fine-tuning performance.
UniMTS follows a contrastive learning framework that aligns motion time series with LLM-enriched
textual descriptions to learn the time series semantics for activity generalization. To prepare large-
scale motion time series for pre-training, we synthesize these time series based on existing extensive
motion skeleton data [19] with comprehensive coverage of different body locations. We model these
synthesized time series using graph networks to capture the spatio-temporal relationships across
devices for location generalization. We further implement rotation-invariant augmentation to ensure
the model’s robustness to any device orientation during testing."
INTRODUCTION,0.04119850187265917,We summarize our primary contributions as follows:
INTRODUCTION,0.04307116104868914,"• We introduce the first unified pre-training procedure for motion time series, UniMTS, which
successfully generalizes to various device locations, device orientations and activities.
• We design a contrastive learning framework to align motion time series with corresponding semantic
meanings for activity generalization. For device location generalization, we propose to synthesize
motion time series covering various body locations and model their spatio-temporal correlations
using graph convolutional neural networks. We also design rotation-invariant augmentation to
make the model agnostic to different device orientations.
• Our pre-trained model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across 18 real-world motion time
series benchmark datasets, notably with performance improvement of 340% in the zero-shot setting,
16.3% in the few-shot setting, and 9.2% in the full-shot setting, compared with the respective
best-performing baselines."

from head-mounted devices [17], limiting their generalizability across different device locations

time series classification. For example, HARGPT [24] processes raw motion time series through
LLMs and incorporates role-play and chain-of-thought strategies for prompting. ContextGPT [3]
designs prompt engineering approaches leveraging context information. However, since LLMs are

methods mostly assume that source and target datasets share the same label names and have the same
number of classes, such as cross-user domain adaptation and cross-dataset domain adaptation only
for those common classes [22, 35, 21]. We aim for a more generic yet challenging generalization

velocities from motion skeleton data. More specifically, for each skeleton joint Ji, we input both
positions pJi,G (mapped from time domain T to R3, defined in global frame G), and orientation
quaternions qJi,GL (mapped from time domain T to the Special Orthogonal Group SO(3), defined

can be arbitrarily configured by the developers. For example, the iOS system defines acceleration
in an opposite direction compared to the Android system2. With the listed risk factors considered,

Datasets and Experimental Setting"
DATASETS AND EXPERIMENTAL SETTING,0.2247191011235955,"We simulate motion time series from existing motion skeleton dataset HumanML3D [19], which
contain both motion skeleton data and corresponding text descriptions as detailed in Section A.1 in
Appendix. We further augment the text descriptions as described in Section 3.3.2."
DATASETS AND EXPERIMENTAL SETTING,0.22659176029962547,"We evaluate on the most extensive motion time series classification benchmark to date, comprising
18 real-world datasets that cover diverse activities. These datasets are collected from various body
locations such as head, chest, back, arm, wrist, waist, hip, leg, knee and ankle. We categorize these
datasets into three difficulty levels: (1) easy level (with fewer than 10 activities): Opportunity [47],
UCI-HAR [2], MotionSense [37], w-HAR [5], Shoaib [49], HAR70+ [58], RealWorld [53], TNDA-
HAR [64]; (2) medium level (with 10 to 20 activities): PAMAP2 [46], USC-HAD [69], Mhealth [4],
Harth [33], UT-Complex [50], Wharf [6], WISDM [59], DSADS [1]; (3) hard level (with more than
20 activities): UTD-MHAD [8], MMAct [26]. We provide the specific number of activities for each
dataset in Table 1 and Table 2, and detail their collection settings in Section A.2 in Appendix."
DATASETS AND EXPERIMENTAL SETTING,0.22846441947565543,"We re-sample the real-world test data to the same sampling frequency as the simulation data (20 Hz),
and apply normalization to ensure consistency in unit measurements, e.g., standardizing accelerations
to m/s2. We pre-train UniMTS using Adam optimizer [25] with a learning rate of 0.0001 on a single
NVIDIA A100 GPU. The pre-training process consumes approximately 13 GB of memory given
a batch size of 64. For text augmentation, we prompt GPT-3.5 (“gpt-3.5-turbo”) to generate k = 3
paraphrases. During each iteration, we randomly generate the mask M by selecting 1 to 5 joints and
mask the remaining joints as zeros. We adopt learnable temperature parameter γ initialized from
CLIP. We evaluate the models using accuracy, macro-F1 and the top-2 retrieval performance R@2."

classification benchmark datasets. We compare UniMTS against classification models with zero-shot
capabilities: ImageBind [16], IMU2CLIP [38], IMUGPT [28] and HARGPT [24]. We also input
the 2D visualizations of motion time series to pre-trained vision-language model LLaVA [30] for
comparison. We detail the configurations of baselines in Section A.3 in Appendix. As shown in
Table 1, UniMTS significantly outperforms all baselines in the zero-shot setting. We also apply the
Wilcoxon-signed rank test with Holm’s α (5%) following previous works [20, 71]. The Wilcoxon-
signed rank test indicates that the improvement of UniMTS compared with all the baselines is"

ZERO-SHOT RESULTS,0.30337078651685395,"Compared with UniMTS, ImageBind and IMU2CLIP are trained on data from single location (head-
mounted devices), limiting their generalization to data collected from other locations. IMUGPT
struggles to generalize across datasets featuring different activities and requires individual training
for each downstream dataset. Both HARGPT and LLaVA focus on simple and easily distinguishable
activities as these language or vision models are not originally trained on motion time series, and they
also require careful prompt designs. Another limitation for all the above models is that they do not
generalize across device orientations. In contrast, UniMTS shows remarkable generalizability to vari-
ous downstream device locations, orientations and activities, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
We also compare with a few ablations of UniMTS as illustrated in the Ablation Study section."

Few-Shot Fine-tuning Results
Apart from the zero-shot setting, we provide a few real samples for each activity and fine-tune
UniMTS and the baselines. More specifically, we provide 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 samples for each activity
and compare UniMTS against ImageBind [16], IMU2CLIP [38], IMUGPT [28], GPT4TS [72],
BioBankSSL [66] and a randomly initialized model with the same model architecture as UniMTS
(referred to as Random). We report both the mean and the standard deviation in Figure 4. UniMTS
also demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in the few-shot fine-tuning setting, showing the
effectiveness of pre-training. Following the same Wilcoxon-signed rank test as in the zero-shot
setting, we observe p-values far below 0.05 (e.g., p-value = 2 × 10−25 for the best-performing
baseline ImageBind), indicating the statistical significance of our improvement."

each of the above components, verifying their respective importance in improving generalization
across locations (graph encoder), orientations (rotation-invariant augmentation) and activities (text

Conclusion and Discussion"
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION,0.5280898876404494,"Conclusion. In this paper, we present the first unified pre-training procedure, UniMTS, for motion
time series classification. Our model is pre-trained only on physics-simulated data, and yet demon-
strates remarkable generalization across diverse real-world motion time series datasets featuring
different device locations, orientations and activities. The simulated data with all-joint coverage are
augmented for rotation invariance and modeled by a graph encoder, improving generalization across
various device factors. During pre-training, contrastive learning aligns time series with their semantic
meanings to improve generalization across activities. Extensive evaluation in zero-shot, few-shot and
full-shot settings consistently demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of UniMTS."
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION,0.5299625468164794,"Limitation and Future Work. We acknowledge a few limitations which we leave as future work. (1)
Simulated motion time series can only be approximations of real signals, which are usually collected
near – rather than directly on – the body joints. For example, sensors on smartwatches collect data
near the wrist, not on the wrist joint itself. We plan to incorporate random offset vectors to better
simulate real-world signal variations near joints. (2) While our framework effectively addresses the
classification task, we intend to extend its applicability to other motion time series tasks such as
inertial navigation. (3) Our current pre-training utilizes existing motion datasets, and we plan to enrich
our pre-training corpus with additional motion data extracted from large-scale video-based pose
estimation. (4) We also plan to integrate our model with efficient inference optimization techniques
such as quantization, pruning and distillation for deployment on edge devices."
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION,0.5318352059925093,"Broad Impact. UniMTS is the first pre-trained motion time series classification model that gener-
alizes to diverse downstream datasets, irrespective of device locations, orientations and activities.
The primary societal concern centers around privacy as motion time series might reveal personal
information, so we ensure strict privacy controls at the earliest stages of model development by
pre-training exclusively on synthetic data. With UniMTS’s state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot,
few-shot and full-shot settings, we believe it would bring broad, positive impact to the community."

Efficiency Analysis"

significantly smaller compared with the 18.69M used in the IMU encoder of the best existing baseline

UCI-HAR, full-shot fine-tuning of UniMTS takes approximately 1.3 minutes to converge while it
takes approximately 9.8 minutes for ImageBind to converge. Moreover, we have run a power estimate
assuming 0.1Hz cadence (i.e., 10-second window size), and it takes approximately 22.64 mW to run
the whole graph model on an eNPU (embedded Neural Processing Unit), which is much smaller than
ImageBind IMU encoder’s power consumption of approximately 702 mW. Therefore, UniMTS is
efficient for real-world applications and suitable to be deployed on edge devices."

locations, orientations and activities, which are verified by our experimental results.

made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.

are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.8445692883895131,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss four limitations and corresponding future works as detailed in
“Limitation and Future Work” of Section 5."
CLAIMS,0.846441947565543,Guidelines:
CLAIMS,0.848314606741573,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8670411985018727,Guidelines:
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8689138576779026,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results."

preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.

BROADER IMPACTS,0.9382022471910112,• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9400749063670412,"• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9419475655430711,11. Safeguards
SAFEGUARDS,0.9438202247191011,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?"
SAFEGUARDS,0.9456928838951311,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.947565543071161,"Justification: The paper does not pose high risk for misusing data or models. We pre-train
the model exclusively on synthetic data to ensure strict privacy control at the earliest stages
of model development."
SAFEGUARDS,0.949438202247191,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.951310861423221,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
