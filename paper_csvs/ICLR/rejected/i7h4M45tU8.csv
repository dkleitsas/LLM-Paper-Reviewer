ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.002976190476190476,"Events across a timeline are a common data representation, seen in different
temporal modalities. Individual atomic events can occur in a certain temporal
ordering to compose higher level composite events. Examples of a composite event
are a patient’s medical symptom or a baseball player hitting a home run, caused
distinct temporal orderings of patient vitals and player movements respectively.
Such salient composite events are provided as labels in temporal datasets and
most works optimize models to predict these composite event labels directly. We
focus on uncovering the underlying atomic events and their relations that lead to
the composite events within a noisy temporal data setting. We propose Neural
Temporal Logic Programming (Neural TLP) which first learns implicit temporal
relations between atomic events and then lifts logic rules for composite events,
given only the composite events labels for supervision. This is done through
efficiently searching through the combinatorial space of all temporal logic rules
in an end-to-end differentiable manner. We evaluate our method on video and
healthcare datasets where it outperforms the baseline methods for rule discovery."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.008928571428571428,"Complex time series data is present across many data modalities such as sensors, records, audio, and
video data. Typically there are composite events of interest in these time series which are composed
of other atomic events in a certain order (Liu et al., 1999; Chakravarthy et al., 1994; Hinze, 2003).
An example is a health symptom that can be observed in a doctor’s report. Atomic events, such as
patient vitals and medications, and their temporal relations dictate an underlying causal rule leading
to the composite event symptom. These rules may be unknown but useful to recover (Kovaˇcevi´c et al.,
2013; Guillame-Bert et al., 2017)."
INTRODUCTION,0.011904761904761904,"Recent methods leverage the advances in highly parameterized deep architectures to learn latent
representations of atomic event data (Pham et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2019),
with the increasing availability of large temporal datasets. Methods, such as LSTM (Hochreiter
& Schmidhuber, 1997) or Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) based architectures, provide state-
of-the-art performance in terms of composite event inference. However, it is uncertain whether
the latent representations learn the underlying causal sequence of events or overfit spurious signals
in the training data. Having representations faithful to causal mechanisms is advantageous for
interpretability, out-of-distribution generalization, and adapting to smaller data sets. Therefore it is
important to leverage parametric models that can handle data noise while providing a mechanism to
extract explicit temporal rules (Carletti et al., 2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.01488095238095238,"Extracting explicit logic rules has been studied through Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
methods (Muggleton, 1991; Muggleton & De Raedt, 1994) and have been leveraged in para-
metric fashions as well (Yang et al., 2017; Evans & Grefenstette, 2018; Rocktäschel & Riedel,
2017). ILP starts with set of background knowledge, consisting of grounded atoms (i.e. facts
which do not contain variables) such as location(Braves, Atlanta), where the predi-
cate location determines the relationship between the items Braves and Atlanta. There
are set of labels from which rules should be learned.
The task is to construct a set of
rules, when executed over the background knowledge, entail the provided labels.
Given the
label InLeague(Braves, NL East) and the background knowledge (Figure 1 ILP Input)
as input, a candidate rule is InLeague(Team, League) := Location(Team, City) ∧"

INTRODUCTION,0.11011904761904762,"Figure 1: In ILP, the grounded background knowledge and known relational predicates between atoms
are provided to induce consistent rules. In the temporal case, we are operating over raw temporal
data samples, such as videos, with potentially multiple labels. Therefore the latent temporal structure
between the atomic events is recovered, and then the rules for composite events are learned."
INTRODUCTION,0.1130952380952381,"Division(City, League). Here InLeague(Team, League) is the head of the rule con-
sisting of an atom with variables Team, League as items. The body consists of two atoms and
when these atoms exist on the background knowledge the rule is evaluated as true.We apply ILP over
real world temporal data, however learning such rules poses three key challenges."
INTRODUCTION,0.11607142857142858,"Temporal Background Knowledge
First, ILP methods operate over an existing grounded back-
ground knowledge. The temporal case does not have this knowledge when operating over raw time
series. For example in a baseball video, grounded atomic events pitch or swing, or grounded
predicates such as before(pitch, swing) are not explicitly provided. By nature, the video
would be labeled with a higher level composite event description, such as ""Player A’s home run""
instead of individual atomic events and their corresponding temporal predicates. Such atoms can be
extracted using a model in a probabilistic fashion at each time point, and a temporal ILP method
should handle this uncertainty. The temporal predicates between these probabilistic atomic events can
be applied in a rule-based manner (ex. t1 < t2 →before), but due to the noisy nature of extracted
atomic events, the predicate predictions should be robust to consistent noise in the atomic event data."
INTRODUCTION,0.11904761904761904,"Atomic Event Relevance
Second, ILP works learn consistent rules that satisfy a path in the
background knowledge given the terms in the labels, such as InLeague(Braves, NL East).
The labels are nullary predicates in the temporal case, so the relevant source and target atomic events
and predicates to use for rule induction are unknown. In our example, we know from the video
we have a label strike, but are not told when it occurred or what other events, such as pitch,
swing, and miss are needed to compose a rule for strike."
INTRODUCTION,0.12202380952380952,"Without a prior on which atomic events to search from, we must consider all pairwise temporal
relations between atomic events in the input. This leads to a combinatorial search of all pairwise
events for each predicate in the temporal rule body."
INTRODUCTION,0.125,"Multi-Event Labels
Third, ILP domains work on disjoint labels, while in time series, multiple
composite events could occur in each input. In our baseball video, such as a highlight reel, composite
event labels strike, steal and their corresponding atomic events can co-occur in a single video.
This further extends the search space of atomic events we consider for each composite event rule."

INTRODUCTION,0.13095238095238096,"We illustrate these differences in Figure 1 and further discuss these challenges regarding search
complexity in Appendix A. To address these challenges, Neural TLP operates on two key steps."
INTRODUCTION,0.13392857142857142,"Parameter Learning
First Neural TLP inputs probabilistic atomic events and learns parameters to
infer temporal predicates between atomic events. We represent the atomic event data in an interval-
based representation to efficiently predict all pairwise predicates between atomic events. The inferred
predicates are then projected to predict the composite event labels."

When the predicate parameters are learned, Neural TLP learns a sparse vector
to select the correct rule over the combinatorial space of possible rules. To prune the search space,
we use the learned projected weights to select candidate grounded predicates per composite event."

Starting from the raw probabilistic atomic event data, we first compress
the timeline through convolution. This 1D convolution over the temporal dimension compresses and
smooths the timeline to mitigate noise from spurious events. Here the convolution kernel K|X|×l of
length l is learned per atomic event. We also parameterize α as an extra degree of freedom to scale
these convolved scores, which is useful when computing the intermediate predicates downstream."

dimension is enumerated from [1, t], where MD:,:,l = l. This can be thought as a positional encoding."
PARAMETER LEARNING STAGE,0.2648809523809524,"For example if we look at the sample compressed scores for a single object i and atomic
event j MCi,j,6:10 = [.01, .05, .7, .7, .03] and MDi,j,6:10 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] then MAi,j,6:10 =
[.06, .35, 5.6, 6.3, .3]. Intuitively we can see that from MAi,j,6:10 that (1) atomic event j occurs
when the scores are high at 5.6 and 6.3 and that (2) score 6.3 occurs after score 5.6 due to the
multiplied time index. This temporal representation provides a path to compute precise time intervals
of atomic event occurrences and define predicates to compare atomic event intervals."
PARAMETER LEARNING STAGE,0.26785714285714285,"Predicate Modeling
From the compressed timelines, we determine the temporal predicates between
atomic events. These relations are computed in a pairwise manner for all atomic events ∀xu, xv ∈X
occurring in object i through a small network which we call Temporal Predicate Network (TPN). For
notation sake here, we represent the atomic event u’s timeline for object i as ti
u = MAi,u,: ∈Rt and
correspondingly for atomic event v. We denote TPN as gθ(ti

timelines and predicts a temporal predicate p ∈P to indicate the relationship between the atomic
events."

are useful from a cross-entropy optimization perspective but deviate from the underlying generative
rule representation (Hits). This can be seen with highly parameterized LSTM models and video

and to rank important predicates before rule training. Temporal MAP fails at this task with the
increased number of atomic events and longer timelines, which led to many grounded predicates
(2-3k) per sample. Therefore the W weights are very coarse and filled with common relations. In
addition to relevant rules, Neural TLP maintains good inference performance (Table 5), which is also
an important metric for this domain."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.5267857142857143,"Structured Temporal Prediction
To optimize over the composite events given observed atomic
events, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are commonly used to model the latent rules that emit
consistent atomic events to induce the composite events. Variants of HMMs have been developed to
handle symbolic atomic events (Mutschler & Philippsen, 2012; Kersting et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2017)
to more perception-based events, such as videos (Tang et al., 2012). Deep models have shown to
incorporate temporal logic constraints within their outputs by leveraging Transformers architectures
(Finkbeiner et al., 2020), knowledge distillation (Ma et al., 2020), and by representing temporal logic
as a differentiable loss (Innes & Ramamoorthy, 2020). However, interpreting latent representations
of deep models in order to extract explicit rules is still being researched (Arras et al., 2019; Chefer
et al., 2021; Lal et al., 2021)."
RELATED WORK,0.5297619047619048,"Rule Representations and Inference
To explicitly induce rules over data, a space temporal logic
rules can be searched to determine appropriate rules. Temporal rules are induced using satisfiability
(SAT) based methods (Neider & Gavran, 2018; Camacho & McIlraith, 2019) given strong priors
to the rule structure and limited data noise. In the presence of noise, softening logic rules using
Markov Logic Networks (Richardson & Domingos, 2006; Song et al., 2013) or probabilistic logic
(ProbLog) (De Raedt et al., 2007; Kimmig et al., 2011) perform approximate inference well, but
are intractable for rule training. Recently Yan & Julius (2021) proposed a network to learn sparse
weights for temporal rules given a fixed rule format."
RELATED WORK,0.5327380952380952,"Inductive Logic Programming
Extracting expressive rules is explored through Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP) methods (Muggleton, 1991; Muggleton & De Raedt, 1994) and within Statistical
Relational Learning literature (Koller et al., 2007; De Raedt & Kersting, 2010). Given fixed back-
ground knowledge, parameterized models softly select the relevant facts used to derive the labels
and therefore lift logic rules (Yang et al., 2017; Evans & Grefenstette, 2018). Atoms can also be
represented as latent vectors to provide probabilistic facts for increased generalizability (Rocktäschel
& Riedel, 2017). Dong et al. (2019) present a more neural architecture to represent first-order logic
and scale to larger rule search spaces."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5416666666666666,"Composite event extraction is a common task across many temporal domains. It is important to
understand the underlying atomic events and their predicates that induce the composite event. We
propose Neural TLP that learns these composite event rules even when provided noisy temporal data.
It first learns parameters for atomic event timeline compression and pairwise predicate prediction.
Then once grounded predicates are reliably inferred, the structure learning stage learns over the space
of combinatorial predicates to induce the final rules. We verified our method on synthetic video tasks
and explored rule recovery in a real-world healthcare dataset."

In typical ILP problems, such as Neural LP (Yang et al., 2017), the rules are induced

Starting at entity node ex ∈ES Neural LP learns the associated edge relations RS to traverse in
order to reach the corresponding ending entity node ey. Since between two entities there can be
many arbitrary paths, given the data, the most likely path is found. This is done by learning the

graph is dense as every event has some temporal relation with respect to all other events. The
edge relations may not be provided in unified knowledge base, where the relations can vary per

GAUSSIAN NOISE WAS ALSO ADDED ALONG THE TIMELINE WHERE EVENTS DID NOT OCCUR TO SIMULATE,0.9940476190476191,"Instead of inferring patient survival directly, the medical doctors suggested to look at circulatory
indicators, specifically urine flow. Additionally they helped us identify a subset of patient vitals and
measurements to use for urine flow, leading to our |X| = 82 boolean atomic events. From the 2k
patients we identify timepoints containing urine information. This serves as a label, and all events
before the urine event are the timeseries inputs. Since patients had multiple indicators of urine during
their stay we have 3.8k samples of time series and urine label (normal or low). During training we
created an 80/20 split for training and validation respectively."
