ABSTRACT,0.0001212268153715602,"Large language models can solve tasks that were not present in the training set.
This capability is believed to be due to in-context learning and skill composition.
In this work, we study the emergence of in-context learning and skill composition
in a collection of modular arithmetic tasks. Specifically, we consider a finite
collection of linear modular functions z = a x + b y mod p labeled by the vector
(a, b) ∈Z2
p. We use some of these tasks for pre-training and the rest for out-of-
distribution testing. We empirically show that a GPT-style transformer exhibits a
transition from in-distribution to out-of-distribution generalization as the number
of pre-training tasks increases. We find that the smallest model capable of out-
of-distribution generalization requires two transformer blocks, while for deeper
models, the out-of-distribution generalization phase is transient, necessitating early
stopping. Finally, we perform an interpretability study of the pre-trained models,
revealing highly structured representations in both attention heads and MLPs; and
discuss the learned algorithms. Notably, we find an algorithmic shift in deeper
models, as we go from few to many in-context examples."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.0003636804461146806,"Large language models (LLMs) can perform simple tasks absent from their training data. This ability
is usually achieved via in-context learning [5]. More importantly, LLMs can perform an even larger
variety of very complex tasks upon appropriate prompting or fine-tuning. The latter ability to perform
complex tasks is usually attributed to the following mechanism. First, LLMs learn a large variety of
simple tasks and, then, how to compose those skills to form very complex skills [3]. Furthermore,
LLMs also exhibit “emergent capabilities” – a sudden emergence of a new complex skill as a function
of scale (either model size, compute or data) [29, 9]. It is plausible that these sudden performance
improvements are due to one or both of these mechanisms. For example, LLMs show grokking
on algorithmic tasks [24], which results from the model learning very structured representations
[18, 11, 20]. Once these representations emerge, the model abruptly learns how to perform the task."
INTRODUCTION,0.0004849072614862408,"In this work, we set out to examine skill composition both empirically and mechanistically. Inspired
by the prior work that investigated emergence of in-context learning on linear regression tasks [1, 25],
we introduce a finite collection of discrete modular arithmetic tasks [24] generalized to the in-context
learning setting. Each task corresponds to learning a linear function z = a x + b y mod p over Zp
from the examples provided in context of the autoregressive model(AM). In the bi-variate case there
are p2 such functions labeled by the vector (a, b). The main objective of this algorithmic dataset is to
probe how AM utilizes the tasks it has learnt during training to solve the new tasks."

INTRODUCTION,0.0018184022305734028,"Our analysis shows that the solution found by the AM after optimization is qualitatively different
from the linear regression cases studied before [1]. In those cases, due to the continuous nature
of the task, AM develops an emergent first-order optimization method that minimizes an emergent
quadratic loss function. Furthermore, as it was shown in [1], a single linear attention layer can solve
the regression problem, while adding extra layers and non-linearities slightly modifies the gradient
descent. In the modular arithmetic case, AM first learns how to solve the pre-training tasks and later
(assuming enough different tasks) develops a generalizing solution by combining the solved tasks."
INTRODUCTION,0.0019396290459449631,"Our main findings as well as the structure of the algorithmic dataset are illustrated on Fig. 1. Our main
findings are: (i) there are four different phases in the end of pre-training depending on the number
of tasks, ni.d., and number of examples per task, α. (ii) At inference time, there is a generalization
transition in the number of few-shot examples, as the number of examples grows, the models starts to
generalize. This effect is somewhat similar to the transition in sample complexity for the modular
arithmetic found in [24]. (iii) model develops a striking circular representation for all of the tasks that
naturally generalizes the circular representations found in the original work [24]. We further find that
the deeper models are easier to optimize, but much harder to interpret. The optimization is discussed
in more detail in the main text. Here we will highlight that optimization for these tasks is challenging
and the AM tends to prefer the minimum that just solve a handful of tasks and memorize the training
set. To avoid such minima we make sure that every batch contains equal number of tasks (meaning
that no tasks is over- or under-represented in each batch). We further find that for larger models early
stopping is necessary because the generalizing solution is transient."

Brown et al. [5] first demonstrated that large models performance
improves substantially when a few examples of the task at hand are provided at inference time, in the
prompt. Akyürek et al. [2], Ahn et al. [1], von Oswald et al. [28] showed that the AM implements
emergent first-order optimization on an emergent objective function to solve linear regression tasks.
Furthermore, [2] showed that larger models learn to perform Bayesian estimation. Garg et al. [10]
demonstrated that transformers can learn several simple classes of functions in context. Kirsch
et al. [15] presented how task diversity and model size would affect the ICL performance for unseen
tasks using a mixture of modified MNIST datasets. Raventos et al. [25] investigated the relation
between task diversity and out-of-distribution ICL ability on linear regression tasks. Lin and Lee [16]
identified two operating modes in ICL using a mixture of linear regression tasks, where for the first
several shots, the model tries to figure out the correct task vector and later uses it to predict the correct
results. Boix-Adserà et al. [4] showed theoretically and experimentally that with enough pre-training
data, a transformer model can perform abstract reasoning that a MLP cannot do. Guo et al. [13]
showed that transformers can use lower layers to memorize and upper layers to perform ICL in a
feature regression setting. It was found in [26] that ICL is a transient phase from the optimization
point of view: it goes away once the model is over-trained. Hendel et al. [14], Liu et al. [17] showed
that language models form in-context vectors, which can be used to steer model predictions."

that for modular addition tasks, models learned to map integers to Fourier features to solve modular

Generalization
There are two notions of generaliza-
tion in this setup. (i) In-distribution: Generalization
to unseen input vectors (xi, yi), but on task vector
(at, bt) the model has seen during pre-training. (ii)
Out-of-distribution: Generalization to task vectors the
model has not seen during pre-training. To clearly
separate these regimes, we split the task vectors into
in-distribution (i.d.) set Ti.d. := {(at, bt)}i.d. and out-
of-distribution (o.o.d.) set To.o.d. := {(at, bt)}o.o.d..
Similarly, we split the input vectors into train and test
sets: Xtrain := {(xi, yi)}train, Xtest := {(xi, yi)}test. This results in four distinct sets of sequences
constructed from those sets; we name them Si.d.

the first two panels of Figure 3(a). This behavior is in correspondence with the original work on
grokking, where the transition to generalizing solution is driven by the amount of data. Further, we
observe that an increase in ni.d. enhances the in-context sample efficiency, i.e. the model generalizes
at inference time with fewer few-shot examples. This indicates the onset of the transition from a
task-memorizing solution to the one that generalizes out-of-distribution. The model switches to a
new algorithmic way of solving the task and the solution is more few-shot-sample-efficient."
TRANSITION DRIVEN BY THE NUMBER OF TASKS,0.009092011152867015,"Shifting our focus to the last two panels of Figure 3(a), we see that when ni.d. ≥256, the model
can solve new tasks that were absent in the training set. Notably, there appears to be a trade-off
between memorization and generalization when the model attains this o.o.d. generalization ability.
As the o.o.d. performance increases, the pre-training performance simultaneously degrades. This
phenomenon indicates a shift in the algorithm implemented by the model. Prior to this transition, the
model primarily needed to select possible vectors from the list of memorized tasks and apply them.
However, post-transition, the model adopts a more universal approach to solve the task in-context.
We emphasize, that the model learns to perform ICL in both scenarios. The difference lies in the
approach to generalization. When the model can only generalize in-distribution it’s task is to classify
the sequence as one of the seen tasks or as unknown. Once it matches the sequence to one of the
memorized task vectors, it does well for x, y pairs that only appear in the test set. However, as the
number of tasks vectors grows the model fails to store them all and is forced to find a method of
determining the task vector algorithmically at inference time. In that case model performs equally
well on seen and un-seen tasks alike. In fact, the small two-layer model we study has such a low
capacity that it entirely skips the in-distribution generalization phase and immediately jumps from
pure memorization to out-of-distribution generalization."

Interestingly, for ni.d. = 28, the ICL ability on So.o.d.

the o.o.d. performance rises and falls along the training process. This phenomenon is likely due to
a competition between the memorizing and generalizing circuits inside the model. Note that this

memorization, resulting in a monotonically increasing o.o.d. loss curve. As the number of pre-training
tasks increases, the loss curve exhibits non-monotonic behavior, indicating competition between two
distinct neural circuits. This transient nature of o.o.d. generalization for ni.d. = 28 is a peculiar case
where memorization circuits are initially suppressed but eventually prevail. With substantial task
diversity, the circuits responsible for generalization take over, culminating in a monotonic loss curve.

difficulties. Here we present our results with d = 4 and d = 2 in Figure 4 and leave the results for
other prime p values in Appendix H."
EFFECT OF MODEL SIZE AND TASK DIFFICULTY,0.010304279306582616,"When comparing phase diagrams in Figure 3 with Figure 4, we observe that those phase diagrams
across different depths are qualitatively similar, where the o.o.d. generalization only emerges with a
large enough number of pre-training tasks. As model capacity decreases, performance on both the
pre-training set and the o.o.d. test set degrades. This is particularly evident in the d = 2 case, where
the pre-training accuracy falls drastically as the model gains o.o.d. generalization ability."
EFFECT OF MODEL SIZE AND TASK DIFFICULTY,0.010425506121954177,"Interesting observations can be made by comparing loss and accuracy on the o.o.d. test set as
a function of context length at the end of training. First, it is evident that as the model depth
decreases, the 1-shot loss surge attributable to memorization becomes milder. Notably, for models
with ni.d. = 29, there is no loss surge in the 1-shot case across all three depths. Furthermore, the
d = 4 model with ni.d. = 28 behaves significantly differently from the corresponding one with d = 2
case, where the model fails to perform ICL for the o.o.d. test set. This is also distinct from the d = 6
case, where the model tends heavily toward memorization due to its excessive capacity. Instead, the
d = 4 model manages to maintain a better balance between memorization and generalization at the
end of pre-training. Consequently, the model has a 1-shot loss surge followed by a notable drop in
ICL loss. This suggests that d = 4 optimally leverages the available model capacity to facilitate
effective learning dynamics for o.o.d. generalization."

INTERPRETING THE LEARNED ALGORITHMS,0.013456176506243181,"We find telling signatures of these algorithms upon analyzing model predictions with varying numbers
of in-context examples (Figure 5). With very few in-context examples, the models implement the
Ratio Matching algorithm. As a canonical example, consider the 1-shot scenario (x1 y1 z1 x y ?).
In this case, Ratio Matching will only solve the task for inputs that obey (x, y) = c1(x1, y1) mod p
for some c1. Indeed, this is exactly what we observe in Figure 5 for both d = 2, 4 models. With many
(∼10) in-context examples, d = 2 and d = 4 models implement different algorithms. The d = 4
model can combine the in-context examples using the Modular Regression algorithm, leading to
near-perfect o.o.d. generalization. On the other hand, the d = 2 model still uses Ratio Matching and
shows sub-optimal performance. We ascribe this to the limited capacity of the d = 2 models. In other
words, the d = 4 models exhibits an algorithmic shift from Ratio Matching to Modular Regression as
them number of in-context examples increases. Whereas, the d = 2 models shows no such shift."

we find highly structured activations as functions of inputs (x, y) (Figure 8 left). Together with our
earlier analysis of Skill I, these observations suggest that the MLP layer following the attention
module with a “circle-of-circles” head (layer 2, head 4 for d = 4 model, see Figure 13 (a)) imple-
ments division operations over GF(p). The bottom panel of Figure 7 succinctly demonstrates the
algorithmic shift from Ratio Matching to Modular Regression as the number of in-context examples
increases. At 2-shot, layer 4 features collapse to identical vectors except when the ratio y/x matches
one of the ratios (y1/x1 or y2/x2). At higher shots, we see a transition to a task-dependent pattern

Regression."

Discussion"
DISCUSSION,0.027760940720087283,"We have investigated the emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in autoregressive
models on a novel algorithmic dataset. The dataset includes a large discrete set of modular arithmetic
tasks and is specifically designed to force models to learn how to solve a variety of tasks. It consists
of learning linear modular functions, where the model is expected to identify and perform a modular
operation in-context. When the number of tasks is relatively small the models can only generalize
in-distribution. Although such models develop ICL capabilities, they simply memorize these task
vectors and use them to classify the input vectors. Once the number of training tasks becomes too
large, the models transition to a qualitatively different algorithmic approach, where the task vector is
determined at inference time."
DISCUSSION,0.027882167535458843,"Finally, we have examined the learnt representations and shown that qualitatively different circuits
are formed in different phases. In the o.o.d. generalization phase, we explain the learnt algorithms
and highlight an in-context algorithmic shift in deeper models."
DISCUSSION,0.028003394350830404,"Limitations
We have limited this work to algorithmic datasets. It remains to be investigated what
lessons can be translated to realistic language models, and what lessons are specific to the current
setting. White-box interpretability analysis of deeper models has proved to be much more difficult
than that of shallower models. Consequently, we still do not understand the role of every individual
component of the network in the deeper cases."

Task Selection and Sequence Design"
REFERENCES,0.03442841556552309,"Task Selection
During the initial exploration phase, we observed that it was challenging for the
model to learn multiple modular arithmetic tasks simultaneously. Typically, the loss would stagnate
at a plateau indefinitely."
REFERENCES,0.034549642380894655,"We hypothesize that when the model is trained on multiple modular arithmetic tasks, the strong bias
inherent in each individual task may interfere significantly. When tasks are selected randomly, the
resultant noise appears to inhibit the learning capabilities of the model, preventing it from acquiring
any meaningful patterns or rules from the data."
REFERENCES,0.03467086919626621,"Ultimately, we adopted a more structured approach to task selection as illustrated in Figure Figure 2,
based on the following rationale: If the model is to learn a specific task vector (at, bt), it would
presumably be more straightforward if one of the two components – either at or bt – has already
learned by the model. This would leave the model with only the other component to decipher, which
we assume is a comparatively simpler task. Thus, we decided to employ the rectangular rule for
sampling task vectors, which we believe strategically reduces the complexity of the learning process
by partially leveraging previously acquired knowledge."

Additional Interpretability Results"

how the algorithm might be implemented inside the model. Importantly, This includes PCA analysis
of embedding (Appendix E.1), other attention heads (Appendix E.2), attentions and MLPs outputs
(Appendix E.3), and finally, the role of MLPs (Appendix E.4). We think it is also crucial to study

embedding for doing modular multiplications. However, one should note that this will not obviate the
importance of the head shown in Figure 6(a), as the model still needs a way to distinguish the same
number that appears in the different positions in the context."

the first layer, prepares a foundation for the essential heads in the latter layer to create a similar

RD PRINCIPLE COMPONENT,0.04230815856467451,"heads put together are seemingly equivalent to Figure 6(b). We surmise that any model that solves
modular arithmetic in-context requires such heads."
RD PRINCIPLE COMPONENT,0.042429385380046064,"From Figure 13(a), we see that the head still pays attention locally within three token positions.
Importantly, it also creates a circle-of-circles while performing PCA over concatenated (x, y) features.
The difference here is that the circle winds twice to go back to its origin. We believe that this factor
of two differences in the period means that this head is effectively combing the row of the embedding
layer of the d = 2 model and the role of the head in Figure 6(a). Overall, we do not yet know why
the model needs to split the logarithm of numbers into even and odd groups."

PCA pattern forms circles while annotated within logarithm space, but depends on the choice of
the sequences. This hints that those two heads are trying to exchange information with the previous
inputs. We leave PCA analysis across different in-context examples to future work."

Label Noise"
TH,0.9842405140016972,"To gain insight into how the model combines the in-context examples, we introduce label-corruption
in the in-context examples. In particular, we note the effect of (i) amount and (ii) position of label
corruption on the model’s performance. When we corrupt a single in-context example for d = 4
model, the model performance remains unaffected for longer sequences. This hints at that weighted
average of the in-context inputs being used in model prediction. The d = 2 model, however, did not
show such resilience."
TH,0.9843617408170687,"Next, we corrupt multiple in-context examples in random locations. We study the effect on model per-
formance as the amount of corrupted labels increases. While the d = 2 model is easily overwhelmed,
the d = 4 model is able to offer strong resistance even at ∼40% label corruption, for long sequences.
This behavior remains invariant with the change in task vector for the particular sequence, indicating
the universality of the underlying algorithm necessary for o.o.d. generalization."

CLAIMS,0.9946660201236514,1. Claims
CLAIMS,0.9947872469390229,"Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our main claim are summarized in Figure 1, Section 4 and Section 5 offer
detailed explainations.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9949084737543945,"• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.995029700569766,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include the limitations of our work in Section 6.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9951509273851376,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ”Limitations” section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs"
CLAIMS,0.9952721542005092,"Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]"
CLAIMS,0.9953933810158807,"Justification: This is not a theoretical paper.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9955146078312522,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility"
CLAIMS,0.9956358346466239,"Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We explained our settings in Section 3 and hyperparameters in Appendix A.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9957570614619954,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code"
CLAIMS,0.9958782882773669,"Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?"
CLAIMS,0.9959995150927385,"Answer: [Yes]
Justification: GitHub link offered.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9961207419081101,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details"
CLAIMS,0.9962419687234816,"Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Details are summarized in Appendix A, with explanations on data split in
Section 3. We also provide code in supplementary material.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9963631955388532,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance"
CLAIMS,0.9964844223542247,"Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We show the standard error in most training curves, with an average of over
three random seeds.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9966056491695963,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ”Yes” if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors)."
CLAIMS,0.9967268759849679,"• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources"
CLAIMS,0.9968481028003394,"Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have a Appendix B on this.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9969693296157109,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics"
CLAIMS,0.9970905564310826,"Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have read and understood the code of ethics; and have done our best to
conform.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9972117832464541,"• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts"
CLAIMS,0.9973330100618257,"Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]"
CLAIMS,0.9974542368771973,"Justification: Our work involves small models and toy datasets. It does no impact the society
at large, beyond improving our understanding of certain aspects of deep learning.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9975754636925688,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations."
CLAIMS,0.9976966905079404,"• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9978179173233119,11. Safeguards
SAFEGUARDS,0.9979391441386835,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?"
SAFEGUARDS,0.9980603709540551,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.9981815977694266,"Justification: Since we train small models on toy-datasets, our work poses no risk of misuse."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9983028245847981,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9984240514001698,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
