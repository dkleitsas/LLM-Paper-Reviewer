ABSTRACT,0.0,Abstract
ABSTRACT,0.0064516129032258064,"Multi-hop Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a task that involves
retrieving nodes from a knowledge graph (KG) to answer natural language ques-
tions. Recent GNN-based approaches formulate this task as a KG path searching
problem, where messages are sequentially propagated from the seed node towards
the answer nodes. However, these messages are past-oriented, and they do not
consider the full KG context. To make matters worse, KG nodes often represent
proper noun entities and are sometimes encrypted, being uninformative in selecting
between paths. To address these problems, we propose Neural Tree Search (Nu-
Trea), a tree search-based GNN model that incorporates the broader KG context.
Our model adopts a message-passing scheme that probes the unreached subtree
regions to boost the past-oriented embeddings. In addition, we introduce the Rela-
tion Frequency–Inverse Entity Frequency (RF-IEF) node embedding that considers
the global KG context to better characterize ambiguous KG nodes. The general
effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through experiments on three major
multi-hop KGQA benchmark datasets, and our extensive analyses further validate
its expressiveness and robustness. Overall, NuTrea provides a powerful means
to query the KG with complex natural language questions. Code is available at

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.01935483870967742,"The knowledge graph (KG) is a multi-relational data structure that defines entities in terms of their
relationships. Given its enormous size and complexity, it has long been a challenge to properly
query the KG via human languages [1–6]. A corresponding machine learning task is knowledge
graph question answering (KGQA), which entails complex reasoning on the KG to retrieve the nodes
that correctly answers the given natural language question. To resolve the task, several approaches
focused on parsing the natural language to a KG-executable form [7–10], whereas others tried to
process the KG so that answer nodes can be ranked and retrieved [11–14, 2]. Building on these
works, there has been a recent stream of research focusing on answering more complex questions
with intricate constraints, which demand multi-hop reasoning on the KG."

INTRODUCTION,0.03225806451612903,"Answering complex questions on the KG requires processing both the KG nodes (entities) and
edges (relations). Recent studies have addressed multi-hop KGQA by aligning the question text
with KG edges (relations), to identify the correct path from seed nodes (i.e., nodes that represent
the question subjects) towards answer nodes. Many of these methods, however, gradually expand
the search area outwards via message passing, whose trailing path information is aggregated onto
the nodes, resulting in node embeddings that are past-oriented. Also, as many complex multi-hop
KGQA questions require selecting nodes that satisfy specific conditions, subgraph-level (subtree-
level) comparisons are necessary in distinguishing the correct path to the answer node. Furthermore,
KG node entities often consist of uninformative proper nouns, and sometimes, for privacy concerns,
they may be encrypted [15]. To address these issues, we propose Neural Tree Search (NuTrea), a
graph neural network (GNN) model that adopts a tree search scheme to consider the broader KG
contexts in searching for the path towards the answer nodes."

it to have a broader view of the KG context in aligning it with human language questions. The

Related Works"
RELATED WORKS,0.06451612903225806,"A knowledge graph (KG) is a type of a heterogeneous graph [19, 20] G = (V, E), whose edges in E
are each assigned to a relation type by the mapping function 𝑓: E →R. The KGs contain structured
information from commonsense knowledge [15, 21] to domain-specific knowledge [22], and the
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) task aims to answer natural language questions
grounding on these KGs by selecting the set of answer nodes. Recent methods challenge on more
complex questions that require multi-hop graph traversals to arrive at the correct answer node. Thus,
the task is aliased as multi-hop KGQA or complex KGQA, which is generally discussed in terms of
two mainstream approaches [23]: Semantic Parsing and Information Retrieval.
Semantic Parsing.
The main idea of semantic parsing-based methods is to first parse natural
language questions into a logical query. The logical query is then grounded on the given KG in an
executable form. For example, [8] applies the semantic query graph generated by natural language
questions. In replace of hand-crafted query templates, [7] introduced a framework that automatically
learns the templates from the question-answer pairs. Also, [24] proposed a novel graph generation
method for query structure prediction. Other methods take a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach,
where previously seen questions are referenced to answer a complex question. Approaches like
[9, 25, 26] use case-based reasoning by referring to similar questions or KG structures. Recently,
[10] proposed a framework that jointly infers logical forms and direct answers to reduce semantic
errors in the logical query. A vast majority of methods that take the semantic parsing approach utilize
the ground-truth logical forms or query executions during training. Thus, these supervised methods
are generally susceptible to incomplete KG settings, but have high explainability.
Information Retrieval.
Information Retrieval-based methods focus on processing the KG to
retrieve the answer nodes. The answer nodes are selected by ranking the subgraph nodes conditioned
on the given natural language question. One of the former works [27] proposes an enhanced Key-Value"
RELATED WORKS,0.07096774193548387,"Memory neural network to answer more complex natural language questions. [28] and [29] extract
answers from question-specific subgraphs generated with text corpora. To deal with incompleteness
and sparsity of KG, [11] presents a KG embedding method to answer questions. Also, [12] handles
this problem by executing query in the latent embedding space. In an effort to improve explainability
of the information retrieval approach, [13] infers an adjacency matrix by learning the activation
probability of each relation type. By adapting the teacher-student framework with the Neural State
Machine (NSM), [14] made learning more stable and efficient. Furthermore, [30] utilized multi-task
learning that jointly trains on the KG completion task and multi-hop KGQA, while [2] provides a
novel link prediction framework. Recently, there has been a trend of borrowing the concept of logical
queries from Semantic Parsing approaches, attempting to learn the logical instructions that guide the
path search on the KG [2, 1]. Our NuTrea also builds on these approaches."
METHOD,0.07741935483870968,"3
Method
In recent studies, models that sequentially process the knowledge graph (KG) from the seed nodes
have shown promising results on the KGQA task. Building upon this approach, we propose Neural
Tree Search (NuTrea). NuTrea adopts a novel message passing scheme that propagates the broader
subtree-level information between adjacent nodes, which provides more context in selecting nodes
that satisfy the complex question constraints. Additionally, we introduce a node embedding technique
called Relation Frequency–Inverse Entity Frequency (RF-IEF), which considers the global KG
information when initializing node features. These methods allow for a richer representation of each
node by leveraging the broader KG context in answering complex questions on the KG."

task is primarily a natural language processing problem that receives a human language question 𝑥𝑞as
input, and requires retrieving the set of nodes from G = (V, E) that answer the question. Following
the standard protocol in KGQA [11], the subject entities in 𝑥𝑞are given and assumed always to
be mapped to a node in V via entity-linking algorithms [31]. These nodes are called seed nodes,
denoted 𝑣𝑠∈V𝑠, which are used to extract a subgraph G𝑞= (V𝑞, E𝑞) from G so that V𝑞is likely to
contain answer nodes 𝑣𝑎∈V𝑎. Then, the task reduces to a binary node classification problem of
whether each node 𝑣∈V𝑞satisfies 𝑣∈V𝑎."

step propagates information outwards to expand the search tree, which is followed by the Backup
step, where the depth-𝐾subtree content is aggregated to each of their root nodes, to enhance the
past-oriented messages from the Expansion step. Then, the nodes are scored based on how likely

the global KG information by suppressing prevalent relation types that hold less meaning. Then, in each NuTrea

by adding and normalizing the logits (Node Ranking), which are utilized in the subsequent layer. The figure

NuTrea considers the broader KG contexts in distinguishing the correct paths, contrary to previous methods that

We experiment on three large-scale multi-hop KGQA datasets: MetaQA [35], WebQues-

splits, 1-hop, 2-hop, and 3-hop, each indicating the number of hops required to reach the answer node
from the seed node. The questions are relatively easy with less constraints. WQP and CWQ, on the
other hand, contain more complex questions with diverse constraints. WQP is relatively easier, as
CWQ is derived from WQP by extending its questions with additional constraints. MetaQA is answer-
able with the WikiMovies knowledge base [27], while WQP and CWQ require the Freebase KG [15]
to answer questions. Further dataset information and statistics are provided in the supplement."

We mainly compare with previous multi-hop KGQA methods that take the Information

scalable KGQA method whose complexity scales linearly with the number of relation types, rather
than nodes or edges. (2) TERP [2] introduces the rotate-and-scale entity link prediction framework to

KGQA baselines that take an information retrieval approach, as discussed in Section 2. Compared to
the previous best, this is a large improvement of 0.6 points. In terms of the F1 score, which evaluates
the answer set prediction, our method achieved a score of 72.7, exceeding the previously recorded
value by a large margin of 1.8 points. In addition, we also improved the previous state-of-the-art
performance on the CWQ dataset by achieving an 53.6 H@1, which is an improvement of 0.7 points."
MAIN EXPERIMENTS,0.4838709677419355,"We also experimented NuTrea on MetaQA to see if it performs reasonably well with easy questions
as well. On three data splits, NuTrea achieved comparable performance with previous state-of-the-art
methods for simple question answering. Evaluating with the average H@1 score of the three splits,
NuTrea performs second best among all baseline models."

Analysis"
ANALYSIS,0.5870967741935483,"In this section, we provide comprehensive analyses on the contributions of NuTrea to ensure its
effectiveness in KGQA. We try to answer the following research questions: Q1. How does each
component contribute to the performance of NuTrea? Q2. What is the advantage of NuTrea’s tree
search algorithm over previous methods? Q3. What are the effects of the RF-IEF node embeddings?"

Ablation Study"
ABLATION STUDY,0.6,"Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of each component in NuTrea to answer Q1. An ablation study is
performed on our two major contributions: the Backup step in our NuTrea layers and the RF-IEF
node embeddings. By removing the RF-IEF node embeddings, we instead apply the common node
initialization method used in [14, 1], which simply averages the relation embeddings incident to each
node. Another option is to use zero embeddings, but we found it worse than the simple averaging
method. For NuTrea layer ablation, we remove the Backup step which plays a key role in aggregating
the future-oriented subtree information onto the KG nodes. Then, only the expansion-score (𝑠(𝑒)
𝑣)
is computed, and the backup-score (𝑠(𝑏)
𝑣) is always 0. Also, the embedding f𝑣(Eq. (5)), is directly
output from the NuTrea layer and no further updates are made via the Backup step."
ABLATION STUDY,0.6064516129032258,"In Table 3, we can see that the largest performance drop is observed when the Backup step is removed.
Without it, the model has limited access to the broader context of the KG and cannot reflect the
complex question constraints in node searching. Further discussion on this property of NuTrea’s
message passing is provided in the next Section 5.2. Also, we observed a non-trivial 0.6 point drop"

EFFICIENCY OF NUTREA,0.6774193548387096,"To provide more insight in terms of number
of NuTrea layers, we also reveal its effect on
model performance, in Figure 5. The figure re-
ports the F1 scores for both with and without
the Backup module, evaluated on the WebQues-
tionsSP dataset. “NuTrea without Backup"" has
an equivalent model configuration used in the
Backup ablation experiment of Table 3. Overall,
the performance of “NuTrea without Backup""
does generally improve with additional layers,
but “NuTrea with Backup"" reached the highest
score of 72.7 with only 2 NuTrea layers. This
is enabled by our Backup module, which allevi-
ates the burden of exhaustively searching deeper
nodes. This is computationally more efficient than stacking multiple layers to achieve higher perfor-
mance. Specifically, by comparing the 2-layer “NuTrea with Backup"" and 5-layer “NuTrea without
Backup"", the former required an average of 73.8 ms of inference time per question, whereas the
latter required 108.6 ms. With only 68% of compute, our NuTrea achieved comparable performance
with the deeper “NuTrea without Backup"". Note, these latency values were evaluated on a different
environment from values reported in Table 4."

Qualitative Results
In Figure 3, we demonstrate several qualitative examples from our error analysis. In each question,
the blue (node) entity is the correct answer choice, while the red is the wrong choice made by the"
QUALITATIVE RESULTS,0.6903225806451613,"model without the Backup step. The values in parentheses demonstrate the difference in node scores
between models without and with Backup. Without it, the sequential search model cannot refer to
local contexts of a node and frequently predicts an extremely low score for the correct answer node
(e.g., 0.0062 for “Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother"" in the first question of Figure 3). Such a
problem is mitigated by our NuTrea’s Backup step, which tends to boost scores of correct answers and
tone down wrong choices that were wrongly assigned with a high score. More qualitative examples
are provided in the supplement, along with an analysis on the different importances of the Backup
step in different datasets, by controlling the context coefficient 𝜆."
EFFECT OF RF-IEF,0.6967741935483871,"5.3
Effect of RF-IEF"
EFFECT OF RF-IEF,0.7032258064516129,"The RF-IEF node embedding is a simple method inspired by an effective text representation technique
in natural language processing. Here, we disclose the specific effect of RF-IEF on the relation
embedding aggregation weights, thereby answering Q3. In Figure 4 (left), the log-scaled 𝐸𝐹(Eq. 13)
value of each relation type is sorted. The globally most frequent relation types, including “self_loop”s,
are too general to provide much context in characterizing a KG node. Our RF-IEF suppresses such
uninformative relation types for node embedding initialization, resulting in a weight distribution like
Figure 4 (right). The pie charts display two examples on the difference between aggregation weights
for a node entity before and after RF-IEF is applied. To illustrate, the weight after RF-IEF corresponds
to a row of 𝑭in Eq. (14), while the weight before RF-IEF would be uniform across incident edges.
As “Alexander Bustamante” is a politician, the relation types “orgainizations founded” and “founders”
become more lucid via RF-IEF, while relations like “events_competed_in” and “competitors” are
emphasized for an athlete like “Kemar Bailey-Cole”. Likewise, RF-IEF tends to scale up characteristic
relation types in initializing the node features, thereby enhancing differentiability between entities. To
further demonstrate RF-IEF’s general applicability, we also provide a plug-in experiment on another
baseline model in the supplement."

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.7161290322580646,"Neural Tree Search (NuTrea) is an effective GNN model for multi-hop KGQA, which aims to
better capture the complex question constraints by referring to the broader KG context. The high
expressiveness of NuTrea is attained via our message passing scheme that resembles the MCTS
algorithm, which leverages the future-oriented subtree information conditioning on the question
constraints. Moreover, we introduce the RF-IEF node embedding technique to also consider the
global KG context. Combining these methods, our NuTrea achieves the state-of-the-art in two major
multi-hop KGQA benchmarks, WebQuestionsSP and ComplexWebQuestions. Further analyses on
KG incompleteness and the qualitative results support the effectiveness of NuTrea. Overall, NuTrea
reveals the importance of considering the broader KG context in harnessing the knowledge graph via
human languages."
