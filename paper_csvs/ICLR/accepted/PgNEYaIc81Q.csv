ABSTRACT,0.003067484662576687,"Objects’ motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their prop-
erties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identiﬁed via
the object’s visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not di-
rectly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties
poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas
humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies
on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object
appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step
to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly
observable from visual appearances, by introducing the Compositional Physical
Reasoning (ComPhy) dataset 1. For a given set of objects, ComPhy includes few
videos of them moving and interacting under different initial conditions. The model
is evaluated based on its capability to unravel the compositional hidden properties,
such as mass and charge, and use this knowledge to answer a set of questions
posted on one of the videos. Evaluation results of several state-of-the-art video
reasoning models on ComPhy show unsatisfactory performance as they fail to
capture these hidden properties. We further propose an oracle neural-symbolic
framework named Compositional Physics Learner (CPL), combining visual per-
ception, physical property learning, dynamic prediction, and symbolic execution
into a uniﬁed framework. CPL can effectively identify objects’ physical properties
from their interactions and predict their dynamics to answer questions."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.009202453987730062,"Why do apples ﬂoat in water while bananas sink? Why do magnets attract each other on a certain
side and repel on the other? Objects in nature often exhibit complex properties that deﬁne how they
interact with the physical world. To humans, the unraveling of new intrinsic physical properties often
marks important milestones towards a deeper and more accurate understanding of nature. Most of
these properties are intrinsic as they are not directly reﬂected in the object’s visual appearances or
otherwise detectable without imposing an interaction. Moreover, these properties affect object motion
in a compositional fashion, and the causal dependency and mathematical law between different
properties are often complex."
INTRODUCTION,0.012269938650306749,"As shown in Fig. 1, different intrinsic physical properties, such as charge and inertia, often lead to
drastically different future evolutions. Objects carrying the same or opposite charge will exert a
repulsive or attractive force on each other. The resulting motion not only depends on the amount of
charge each object carries, but also their signs (see Fig. 1-(a)). The inertia determines how sensitive an
object’s motion is to external forces. When a massive object interacts with a light object via attraction,
repulsion, or collision, the lighter object will undergo larger changes in its motion compared with the
massive object’s trajectory (see Fig. 1-(b))."

of) charge they carry. b) Mass determines how much an object’s trajectory is perturbed during an
interaction. Heavier objects have more stable motion."
INTRODUCTION,0.03374233128834356,"2020). These benchmarks introduce reasoning tasks over a wide range of complex object motion
and interactions, which poses enormous challenges to existing models since most tasks require them
to fully capture the underlying physical dynamics and, in some cases, be able to make predictions.
However, the majority of complexity in the motion trajectories facilitated by these environments
comes from changes or interventions in the initial conditions of the physical experiments. The effects
of object intrinsic physical properties, as well as the unique set of their challenges, are therefore of
great importance for further investigation."
INTRODUCTION,0.03680981595092025,"It’s non-trivial to build a benchmark for compositional physical reasoning. Existing benchmarks (Yi
et al., 2020; Ates et al., 2020) assume that there is no variance in objects’ physical properties and ask
models to learn physical reasoning from massive videos and question-answer pairs. A straightforward
solution is to correlate object appearance with physical properties like making all red spheres to be
heavy and then ask questions about their dynamics. However, such a design may incur shortcuts
for models by just memorizing the appearance prior rather than understanding coupled physical
properties. In this work, we propose a novel benchmark called ComPhy that focuses on understanding
object-centric and relational physics properties hidden from visual appearances. ComPhy ﬁrst
provides few video examples with dynamic interactions among objects for models to identify objects’
physical properties and then asks questions about the physical properties and corresponding dynamics.
As shown in Fig. 2, ComPhy consists of meta-train sets and meta-test sets, where each data point
contains 4 reference videos and 1 target video. Within each set, the objects share the same intrinsic
physical properties across all videos. Reasoning on ComPhy requires the model to infer the intrinsic
and compositional physical properties of the object set from the reference videos, and then answer
questions about this query video. To make the task feasible, we systematically control each object in
the query video that should appear at least in one of the reference videos."
INTRODUCTION,0.03987730061349693,"We also introduce an oracle model to tackle this task. Inspired by recent work on neural-symbolic
reasoning on images and videos (Yi et al., 2018; 2020; Chen et al., 2021), our model consists of four
disentangled components: perception, physical property learning, dynamics prediction, and symbolic
reasoning. Our model is able to infer objects’ compositional and intrinsic physical properties, predict
their future, make counterfactual imaginations, and answer questions."
INTRODUCTION,0.04294478527607362,"To summarize, this paper makes the following contributions. First, we present a new physical
reasoning benchmark ComPhy with physical properties (mass and charge), physical events (attraction,
repulsion), and their composition with visual appearance and motions. Second, we decorrelate
physical properties and visual appearance with a few-shot reasoning setting. It requires models to
infer hidden physical properties from only a few examples and then make predictions about the
system’s evolution to help answer the questions.
Third, we propose an oracle neural-symbolic
framework, which is a modularized model that can infer objects’ physical properties and predict
the objects’ movements. At the core of our model are graph neural networks that capture the
compositional nature of the underlying system."

where objects can move within a vertical 2D plane under gravity. Each task is associated with a
goal state, and the model solves the task by specifying the initial condition that will lead to the
goal state. CLEVRER (Yi et al., 2020) contains videos of multiple objects moving and colliding
on a ﬂat plane, posting natural language questions about description, explanation, prediction, and
counterfactual reasoning on the collision events. CoPhy (Baradel et al., 2020) includes experiment
trials of objects moving in 3D space under gravity. The task focuses on predicting object trajectories
under counterfactual interventions on the initial conditions. Our dataset contributes to these physical
reasoning benchmarks by focusing on physical events driven by object intrinsic properties (situations
shown in Fig. 2). ComPhy requires models to identify intrinsic properties from only a few video
examples and make dynamic predictions based on the identiﬁed properties and their compositionality."
RELATED WORK,0.06748466257668712,"Dynamics Modeling. Dynamics modeling of physical systems has been a long-standing research
direction. Some researchers have studied this problem via physical simulations, drawing inference on
the important system- and object-level properties via statistical approaches such as MCMC (Battaglia
et al., 2013; Hamrick et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015), while others propose to directly learn the forward
dynamics via neural networks (Lerer et al., 2016). Graph neural networks (Kipf & Welling, 2017),
due to their object- and relation-centric inductive biases and efﬁciency, have been widely applied
in forwarding dynamics prediction on a wide variety of systems (Battaglia et al., 2016; Chang
et al., 2016; Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020; Li et al., 2019a). Our work combines the best of the
two approaches by ﬁrst inferring the object-centric intrinsic physical properties and then predicting
their dynamics based on the intrinsic properties. Recently, VRDP (Ding et al., 2021) performs
object-centric dynamic reasoning by learning differentiable physics models."

These object appearance attributes and events form the basic concepts of the questions in ComPhy."
VIDEOS,0.13496932515337423,"Physical Property. Previous benchmarks (Riochet et al., 2018; Yi et al., 2020) mainly study
appearance concepts like color and collision that can be perceived in even a single frame. In ComPhy,
we additionally study intrinsic physical properties, mass and charge, which can not be directly
captured from objects’ static appearance. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), objects with same or opposite
charge will repel or attract each other while objects without charge will not affect each other’s motion
without collision. As shown Fig. 1 (b), the object with larger mass (inertia) tends to maintain its
original moving direction after the collision while the light object changes much more in its moving
direction. Note that these intrinsic physical properties are orthogonal to the appearance attributes
and can be combined with each other to generate more complicated and diverse dynamic scenes.
For simplicity, ComPhy contains two mass values (heavy and light) and three charge types (positive
charged, negative charged and uncharged). Theoretically, we can add more physical properties like
bounciness coefﬁcients and friction into ComPhy and make their values continuous. However, such a
design will make the dataset too complicated and even difﬁcult for people to infer the properties."
VIDEOS,0.13803680981595093,"Video Generations. For each video, we ﬁrst use a physical engine (Coumans & Bai, 2016–2021)
to simulate objects’ motions and then adopt a graphs engine (Community, 2018) to render frame
sequences. Each target video for question answering contains 3 to 5 objects with random composition
between their appearance attributes and physical properties. We set the length of the target video to
be 5 seconds and additionally simulate the 6-th and 7-th seconds of the target video for predictive
question annotation. We provide more video generation details in the Appendix."
VIDEOS,0.1411042944785276,"Task Setup. It is not trivial to design a task setup to evaluate models’ ability for physical reasoning
since physical properties are not observable in a static frame. A straightforward design is to correlate
object appearance with the physical property like “red object is heavy”, “yellow object is light” and
then ask “what would happen if they collide”. However, such a setting is imperfect since it can not
evaluate whether a model really understands the physical properties or just memorize the visual
appearance prior. An ideal setting should be able to evaluate whether a model is like a human that
can identify objects’ properties from objects’ motion and interactions with each other in the dynamic
scenes and make the corresponding dynamic predictions."

target video, but the length of the videos is set to 2 seconds for scaling up. The interaction among
objects in reference videos helps models to inference objects’ properties. For example, the repulsion
in Reference video 1 of Fig. 2 can help us identify that object 1 and object 2 carrying the same charge."

questions for factual, predictive, and counterfactual reasoning. Each question is paired with a
functional program, which provides a series of explicit reasoning steps. We set all factual questions to
be “open-ended” that can be answered by a single word or a short phrase. We set predictive questions
and counterfactual questions to be multiple-choice and require models to independently predict each
option is true or false. We provide question templates and examples in the Appendix."
QUESTIONS,0.16257668711656442,"Factual. Factual questions test models’ ability to understand and reason about objects’ physical
properties, visual attributes, events, and their compositional relations. Besides the factual questions in
existing benchmarks (Yi et al., 2020; Ates et al., 2020), as shown in the samples in Fig. 2 (I), ComPhy
includes novel and challenging questions asking about objects’ physical properties, charge and mass."
QUESTIONS,0.1656441717791411,"Predictive. Predictive questions evaluate models’ ability to predict and reason about the events

hypothetical condition. ComPhy targets at reasoning the dynamics under the hypothesis that a certain
object carrying a different physical property. Fig. 2 (II) shows typical question samples. Previous
work (Yi et al., 2020; Riochet et al., 2018) also has counterfactual questions. However, they are
merely based on the hypothesis that an object is removed rather than an object is carrying a different
physical property value, which has different or even opposite effects on object motion prediction."

BALANCING AND STATISTICS"
BALANCING AND STATISTICS,0.17484662576687116,"Overall, ComPhy has 8,000 sets for training, 2,000 sets for validation, and 2,000 for testing. It
contains 41,933 factual questions, 50,405 counterfactual questions and 7,506 predictive questions,
occupying 42%, 50% and 8% of the dataset, respectively. For simplicity, we manually make sure that
a video set will only contain a pair of charged objects if it contains charged objects. Similarly, a video
will only contain a heavy object or no heavy objects. A non-negligible issue of previous benchmarks
like CLEVRER is its bias. As pointed out by Ding et al. (2020), about half of the counterfactual
objects in CLEVRER have no collisions with other objects and the counterfactual questions can be
solved merely based on the observed target videos. In ComPhy, we manually remove counterfactual
questions on objects that have no interaction with other objects. When generating questions for
comparing mass values and identifying charge relations between two objects, we systematically
control that the two objects should have at least one interaction in one of the provided few video
examples. We make sure that the few video examples are informative enough to answer questions
based on the questions’ programs and the video examples’ property and interaction annotation."

BASELINES,0.22085889570552147,"Factual Reasoning. Factual questions in ComPhy require models to recognize objects’ visual
attributes, analyze their moving trajectories and identify their physics property to answer the questions.
Based on the result, we have the following observation. First, we ﬁnd that the “blind” models,
Random, Frequent and Blind-LSTM achieve much worse performance than other video question
answering models and reasoning models. This shows the importance of modeling both visual context
and linguistic information on ComPhy. We also ﬁnd that video question answering models CNN-
LSTM and HCRN perform worse than visual reasoning models MAC and ALOE. We believe the
reasons are that models like HCRN are mostly designed for human action video, which mainly
focuses on temporal modeling of action sequences rather than spatial-temporal modeling of physical
events. Among all the baselines, we ﬁnd that MAC performs the best on factual questions, showing
the effectiveness of its compositional attention mechanism and iterative reasoning processes."

terfactual and future reasoning. We think the reason is that the self-attention mechanism and object
masking self-supervised techniques provides the model with the ability to model spatio-temporal
visual context and imaging counterfactual scenes to answer the questions."

MODEL"
MODEL,0.3067484662576687,"We propose an oracle model that performs compositional dynamics reasoning based on a neural-
symbolic framework. Inspired by the recent models (Yi et al., 2018; 2020), we factorize the process
of physical reasoning into several stages. As shown in Fig. 3, our model consists of four major stages:
perception (I), property inference (II), dynamic prediction (III), and symbolic dynamics reasoning
(IV). Given a target video, 4 reference videos, and a query question, we ﬁrst detect objects’ location
and appearance attributes with a perception module. Objects’ trajectories are fed into a physical
property learner to learn their physical properties. Given objects’ properties and location, the dynamic
predictor predicts objects’ dynamics based on the physical properties. Finally, an execution engine
runs the program from the language parser on the predicted objects’ motion to answer the question."
MODEL,0.3098159509202454,"Our model’s core contribution lies in a physical property learner that infers the hidden per-object
and pairwise properties from the videos and a dynamics model that predicts dynamics based on the
inferred physical properties. These modules enable our model to tackle challenging physics reasoning
tasks that involve physical properties that are not directly observable."

MODEL,0.3159509202453988,"Perception. Our perception module detects and recognizes all objects at every video frame. Given an
input frame, our model ﬁrst applies a Mask-RCNN (He et al., 2017) to detect all objects in the frame
and extract corresponding visual attributes like color, shape, and material. The perception module
outputs the static attributes of all objects as well as their full-motion trajectories during the video.
Please refer to (Yi et al., 2018) for further details."

capability to tackle complex and compositional physical interactions. Given the object motion
trajectories from all reference and target videos, the PPL predicts the mass and relative charge
between each object pair in the video. Under the hood, PPL is implemented using a graph neural
network (Kipf et al., 2018) where the node features contain object-centric property (mass) and edge
features encode pairwise properties (relative charge).. Given the input trajectories {xi}N

MODEL,0.3312883435582822,"We further note that because the system is invariant under charge inversion, the charge property is
described by the relative signs between each object pair, even though the charge carried by each
individual object should be easy to recover given the pairwise relation plus the true sign of one object.
The full physical property of a video set can be represented as a fully connected property graph. Each
node represents an object that appears in at least one of the videos from the set. And each edge
represents if the two nodes the edge connects carry the same, opposite, or no relative charge (that is,
one or both objects are charge-neutral). As shown in Fig. 3(II), for each reference video, PPL only
predicts the properties of the objects it covers, revealing only parts of the property graph. We align
the predictions of different nodes and edges by objects’ static attributes predicted by the perception
module. The full object properties are obtained by combining all the subgraphs generated by each
video from the set via max-pooling over node and edge."

one-hot indicator vector zi,j correspondingly.

ALOE,0.4049079754601227,"to the baseline methods in Table 2. The high accuracy on factual questions shows that CPL is able
to inference objects’ physical properties from few video examples and combine them with other
appearance properties and events for question answering. Speciﬁcally, we compare the mass and
charge edge label prediction result with the ground-truth labels and ﬁnd that they achieve an accuracy
of 90.4% and 90.8%. This shows that that the PPL in CPL are able to learn physical properties
from objects’ trajectories and interactions in a supervised manner. We also implement a graph
neural network baseline that only relies on the target video without reference videos. It achieves
an accuracy of 59.4% and 70.2% on mass and charge edge labels. This indicates the importance of
reference videos for physical property inference. For better analysis, we have reported a baseline
with ground-truth object properties and visual static and dynamic attributes (CPT-Gt). Although it
achieves constant gains, there is still much room for further improvement. This shows the bottleneck
of ComPhy lies in predicting physical-based dynamics."
ALOE,0.40797546012269936,"Dynamics Reasoning. The better performance in counterfactual and predictive questions indicates
that CPL can image objects’ motions in counterfactual and future scenes based on the identiﬁed
physical properties to some extent. We also notice that there is still a large gap between CPL’s
performance and human performance shown in Section 4.2 especially on counterfactual reasoning.
We ﬁnd that the dynamic predictor in CPL still shows its limitation on long-term dynamic prediction.
This suggests that a stronger dynamic predictor may further boost CPL’s performance."
ALOE,0.4110429447852761,"Comparison between CPL and NS-DR+. We also implement a variant of the NS-DR (Yi et al.,
2020) model for better analysis. NS-DR does not explicitly consider changes in physical properties
like mass and charge; thus it cannot run the symbolic programs related to the physical properties
in ComPhy. To run NS-DR successfully in ComPhy, we provide NS-DR with extra ground-truth
physical property labels. The variant, NS-DR+ uses the PropNet (Li et al., 2019b) for dynamics
predictions, which does not consider the mass and charge information of the objects. Compared to
our model, NS-DR+ assumes extra information and can directly answer factual questions using the
supplied ground-truth labels; thus we ignore the comparison on factual questions and focus on the
evaluation on the models’ ability for dynamic prediction. As shown in Table 3, CPL achieves much
better performance than NS-DR+ on counterfactual questions and predictive questions, showing the
importance of modeling mass and charges on nodes and edges of the graph neural networks."
ALOE,0.41411042944785276,"Generalization to More Complex Scenes. To test the model’s generalization ability, we additionally
generate a new dataset that contains videos with more objects (6 to 8) and contains both an object
with a large mass and a pair of charged objects. We show the performance of the best baseline
models ALOE, ALOE (Ref) and CPL in Fig. 4. Both ALOE models and CPL have a large drop
in question-answering performance. We believe the reason is that the transformer layer in ALOE,
the graph neural network based-physical property learner and dynamics predictor in CPL show
limitation on more complex visual dynamic scenes, which has a different statistic distribution as the
scenes in the original training set. We leave the development of more powerful models with stronger
generalization ability as future work."

CONCLUSIONS,0.42024539877300615,"In this paper, we present a benchmark named ComPhy for physical reasoning in videos. Given few
video examples, ComPhy requires models to identify objects’ intrinsic physical properties and predict
their dynamics in counterfactual and future scenes based on the properties to answer the questions. We
evaluate various existing state-of-the-art models on ComPhy, but none of them achieves satisfactory
performance, showing that physical reasoning in videos is still a challenging problem and needs
further exploration. We also develop an oracle model named CPL, using graph neural networks to
infer physical properties and predict dynamics. We hope that ComPhy and CPL can attract more
research attention in physical reasoning and building more powerful physical reasoning models."

EXAMPLES FROM COMPHY"
REFERENCES,0.598159509202454,"Here we provide more examples from ComPhy in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. From these examples, we can
see the following features of ComPhy. First, to answer the factual questions, models not only need
to recognize objects’ visual appearance attributes and events in the video but also identify their
intrinsic physical properties from the given video set. Second, to answer counterfactual and predictive
questions, models needs to predict objects’ dynamics in counterfactual or future scenes, which can be
severely affected by intrinsic physical properties. We also show some typical question and choice
samples as well as their underlying reasoning program logic in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8."

VIDEO GENERATION"
REFERENCES,0.6042944785276073,"We provide more details for video generation. The generation of the videos in ComPhy can be
decomposed into two steps. First, we adopt a physical engine Bullet Coumans & Bai (2016–2021)
to simulate objects’ motions and their interactions with each other. Since Bullet does not ofﬁcially
support the effect of electronic charges, we add external forces between charged objects, whose
values are inversely proportional to the square of the objects’ distance, to simulated Coulomb forces.
We assign the light object with a mass value of 1 and assign heavy object with a mass value of 5.
We manually make sure that each reference video at least contain an interaction (collision, charge
and mass) among objects to provide enough information for physical property inference. And each
object should appear at least once in the reference videos. The simulated objects’ motions are sent to
BlenderCommunity (2018) to render high-quality image sequences."

QUESTION TEMPLATES"

the table, we can see that the new question templates have more symbolic operators related to the
physical properties. Phrases like “heavy moving spheres” and “charged cubes” require
models to infer objects’ physical property values; phrases like “...
heavier than ...”
require models to compare the relative physical property values of two objects. For counterfactual
questions, we have new conditions like “If the cyan object were uncharged” and “If
the sphere were lighter”. They aim to reason the dynamics under the hypothesis that a
certain object carrying a different physical property. Such new features in language make ComPhy
unique and challenging."

CPL DETAILS"

Inspired by the NS-DR model in (Yi et al., 2020), CPL decomposes physical reasoning in ComPhy
into four main components, visual perception, physical property learning, property based dynamic
predictor and symbolic execution."
REFERENCES,0.6196319018404908,"The symbolic execution component ﬁrst adopts a program parser to parse the query question into a
functional program, containing a series of neural operations. The program parser is an attention-based
seq2seq model Bahdanau et al. (2015), whose input is the word sequence in the question/choice and
output is the sequence of neural operations. The symbolic executor then executes the operations on the
predicted dynamic scene to get the answer to the question. We summarize all the symbolic operations
in CPL in table 5. Compared with the previous benchmarks Yi et al. (2020); Ates et al. (2020),
ComPhy has more operation on physical property identiﬁcation, comparison and corresponding
dynamic prediction."

BASELINE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS"

Similar to CLEVRER (Yi et al., 2020), we use ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016) to extract visual feature
sequences for CNN+LSTM and MAC and variants with reference videos. We evenly sample 25
frames for each target video and 10 frames for each reference video. For HCRN, we use appearance
feature from ResNet-101 (He et al., 2016) and motion feature from ResNetXt-101 (Xie et al., 2017;
Hara et al., 2018) following the ofﬁcial implementation. For ALOE, we use MONet(Burgess et al.,
2019) to extract visual representation and sample 25 frames for each target video. For ALOE (Ref),
we sample 10 frames for each reference video and concatenate the reference frames and the target
frames as visual representation. We train all the models until they are fully converged, select the best
checkpoint on the validation set and ﬁnally test on the testing set."
