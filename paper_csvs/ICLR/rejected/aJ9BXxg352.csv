ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0012330456226880395,"Randomized smoothing is currently considered the state-of-the-art method to ob-
tain certiﬁably robust classiﬁers. Despite its remarkable performance, the method
is associated with various serious problems such as “certiﬁed accuracy water-
falls”, certiﬁcation vs. accuracy trade-off, or even fairness issues. Input-dependent
smoothing approaches have been proposed with intention of overcoming these
ﬂaws. However, we demonstrate that these methods lack formal guarantees and
so the resulting certiﬁcates are not justiﬁed. We show that the input-dependent
smoothing, in general, suffers from the curse of dimensionality, forcing the vari-
ance function to have low semi-elasticity. On the other hand, we provide a theoret-
ical and practical framework that enables the usage of input-dependent smoothing
even in the presence of the curse of dimensionality, under strict restrictions. We
present one concrete design of the smoothing variance and test it on CIFAR10 and
MNIST. Our design solves some of the problems of classical smoothing and is
formally underlined, yet further improvement of the design is still necessary."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.0036991368680641184,"Deep neural networks are one of the dominating recently used machine learning methods. They
achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of applications like computer vision, natural lan-
guage processing, and many others. The key property that makes neural networks so powerful is
their expressivity (G¨uhring et al., 2020). However, as a prize, they possess a weakness - a vulnera-
bility against adversarial attacks (Szegedy et al., 2013; Biggio et al., 2013). The adversarial attack
on a sample x is a point x′ such that the distance d(x′, x) is small, yet the model f’s predictions on
x and x′ differ. Such examples are often easy to construct, for example by optimizing for a change
in prediction f(x) (Biggio et al., 2013). Even worse, these attacks are present even if the model’s
prediction on x is unequivocal."
INTRODUCTION,0.004932182490752158,"This property is highly undesirable because in several sensitive applications, misclassifying a sam-
ple just because it does not follow the natural distribution might lead to serious and harmful conse-
quences. A well-known example would be a sticker placed on a trafﬁc sign, which could possibly
confuse the self-driving car and cause an accident (Eykholt et al., 2018). To prevent this behaviour,
the robustness of classiﬁers against adversarial examples has begun to be a strongly discussed topic.
Though many methods claim to provide robust classiﬁers, just some of them are certiﬁably robust,
i.e. the robustness is mathematically guaranteed. The certiﬁability turns out to be essential since
more sophisticated attacks can break empirical defenses (Carlini & Wagner, 2017)."
INTRODUCTION,0.006165228113440197,"Currently, the dominating method to achieve the certiﬁable robustness is randomized smoothing
(RS). This clever idea to get rid of adversarial examples using randomization of input was introduced
by Lecuyer et al. (2019) and Li et al. (2019) and fully formalized and improved in Cohen et al.
(2019). Let f be a classiﬁer classifying inputs x ∈RN as one of the classes C ∈C. Assume
now a random deviation ϵ ∼N(0, σ2I). The smoothed classiﬁer g, made of f, is deﬁned as:
g(x) = arg maxC P(f(x + ϵ) = C), for C ∈C. In other words, the smoothed classiﬁer classiﬁes a
class that has the highest probability under the sampling of f(x + ϵ). Consequently, an adversarial
attack x′ on f is less dangerous for g, because g does not look directly at x′, but rather at its whole
neighborhood, in a weighted manner. This way, we can get rid of local artifacts that f possesses –
thus the name “smoothing”. It turns out, that g enjoys strong robustness properties against attacks"

INTRODUCTION,0.008631319358816275,"bounded by a speciﬁcally computed l2-norm threshold, especially if f is trained under a Gaussian
noise augmentation (Cohen et al., 2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.009864364981504316,"Unfortunately, since the introduction of the RS, several serious problems were reported to be con-
nected to the technique. Cohen et al. (2019) mention two of them. First is the usage of lower
conﬁdence bounds to estimate the leading class’s probability. With a high probability, this leads to
smaller reported certiﬁed radiuses in comparison with the true ones. Moreover, it yields a theoret-
ical threshold, which upper-bounds the maximal possible certiﬁed radius and causes the “certiﬁed
accuracy waterfalls”, signiﬁcantly decreasing the certiﬁed accuracy. This problem is particularly
pronounced for small levels of the used smoothing variance σ2, which motivates to use larger vari-
ance. Second, RS possesses a robustness vs. accuracy trade-off problem. The bigger σ we use as the
smoothing variance, the smaller clean accuracy will the smoothed classiﬁer have. This motivates to
use rather smaller levels of σ. Third, as pointed out by Mohapatra et al. (2020a), RS smoothens the
decision boundary of f in such a way, that bounded or convex regions begin to shrink as σ increases,
while the unbounded and anti-convex regions expand. This, as the authors empirically demonstrate,
creates a disbalance in class-wise accuracies of g and causes serious fairness issues. Therefore,
again, the smaller values of σ are more preferable. See Appendix A for a detailed discussion."
INTRODUCTION,0.011097410604192354,"Clearly, the usage of a global, constant σ is suboptimal. For the samples close to the decision bound-
ary, we want to use small σ, so that f and g have similar decision boundaries and the expressivity
of f is not lost (where not necessary). On the other hand, far from the decision boundary of f,
where the probability of the dominant class is close to 1, we need bigger σ to avoid the severe
under-certiﬁcation (see Appendix A). Together, using a non-constant σ(x) rather than constant σ, a
suitable smoothing variance could be used to achieve optimal robustness. Yet there are some works
introducing this concept (see Appendix C), most of them lack mathematical reasoning about the
correctness of their method, which, as we show, turns out to be critical."
INTRODUCTION,0.012330456226880395,"To support this argumentation, we present a toy example. We train a network on a 2D dataset of a
circular shape with the classes being two complementary sectors, where one is of a very small angle.
In Figure 1 we show the difference between constant and input-dependent σ. Using non-constant
σ(x) deﬁned in Equation 1, we obtain an improvement both in terms of the certiﬁed radiuses as well
as clean accuracy. For more details see Appendix A."
INTRODUCTION,0.013563501849568433,"Figure 1: Motivating toy experiment. The constant σ = 0.6 and the input-dependent σ(x) equal
in average to the constant σ are used. Left: Dataset and the variance function depicted as circles
with the radius equal to σ(x) and centers at the data points. Middle: Zoomed in part of the dataset
and decision boundaries of the smoothed classiﬁers with constant σ (red) and input-dependent σ(x)

smoothing strength close to the decision boundary. Right: Certiﬁed accuracy plot. The waterfall
effect vanishes since the points far from the decision boundary are certiﬁed with a correspondingly
large σ(x)."
INTRODUCTION,0.014796547472256474,"The main contributions of this work are fourfold. First, we generalize the methodology of Cohen
et al. (2019)’s work for the case of input-dependent RS (IDRS), obtaining useful and important
insights about how to use the Neyman-Pearson lemma in this, general, case. Second and most
importantly, we show that the IDRS suffers from the curse of dimensionality in the sense that the
semi-elasticity coefﬁcient r of σ(x) (that is | log(σ(x0))−log(σ(x1))| ≤r∥x0−x1∥∀x0, x1 ∈RN)
in a high-dimensional setting is restricted to be very small. This means, that even if we wanted to
vary the σ(x) signiﬁcantly with varying x, we can’t. The maximal reasonable speed of change of
σ(x) turns out to be almost too small to handle, especially in high dimensions. Third, in contrast,"

INTRODUCTION,0.01726263871763255,"we also study the conditions on σ(x) under which it is applicable in high-dimensional regime and
prepare a theoretical framework necessary to build an efﬁcient certiﬁcation algorithm. We are the
ﬁrst to do so for σ(x) functions, which are not locally constant (as in Wang et al. (2021)). Finally, we
provide a concrete design of the σ(x) function and test it extensively and compare it to the classical
RS on the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets. We discuss to what extent the method treats the issues
mentioned above."

smoothed class probability predictor, if Gf(x)C = P(f(x + ϵ) = C), where ϵ ∼N(0, σ(x)2I)

omit the subscript f in gf often, since it is usually clear from the context, to which base classiﬁer
the g corresponds. Furthermore, let A := g(x) refer to the most likely class under the random
variable f(N(x, σ2I)), while B denote the second most likely class. Deﬁne pA = Gf(x)A and
pB = Gf(x)B as the respective probabilities. It is important to note that in practice, it is impossible
to estimate pA and pB precisely. Instead, pA is estimated as a lower conﬁdence bound (LCB) of the
relative occurence of class A in f’s predictions given certain number of Monte-Carlo samples n and
a conﬁdence level α and the estimate is denoted as pA. We use the exact Clopper-Pearson interval
for estimation of the LCB. Similarly for pB. We work with l2-norms denoted as ∥x∥."

For such a probability, constant σ = 0.5 is more than sufﬁcient to guarantee the certiﬁed radius of

no sample within the distance of 1 from x0 uses σ1 < 0.953σ0. To even strengthen this statement,
note that one needs to guarantee σ1 to be even much closer to σ0 in practice. Why? The results of
Theorem 4 lower-bound the ξ functions at 0. However, since ξ functions are strictly increasing (as
shown in Appendix F), one usually needs σ0 and σ1 to be much closer to each other to guarantee ξ
being smaller than 0.5 at a ≫0. This not only forces the σ(x) function to have really small semi-

HOW TO USE INPUT-DEPENDENT SMOOTHING PROPERLY"
HOW TO USE INPUT-DEPENDENT SMOOTHING PROPERLY,0.09617755856966707,"As we discuss above, usage of IDRS is challenging. How can we use σ(x) and obtain valid, math-
ematically justiﬁed certiﬁed radiuses? Fix some design σ(x). If σ(x) is not trivial, to obtain a
certiﬁed radius at x0, we need to go over all the possible adversaries x1 in the neighborhood of x0,
compute σ1 and ξ<,>(a). Then, the certiﬁed radius is the inﬁmum over ∥x0 −x1∥for all uncertiﬁed
x1 points. Of course, this is a priori infeasible. Fortunately, the ξ functions possess a property that
helps to simplify this procedure. For convenience, we extend the notation of ξ functions such that
ξ(a, σ1) additionally denotes the dependance on the σ1 value.
Theorem 6. Let x0, x1, pA, σ0 be as usual and let ∥x0 −x1∥= R. Then, the following two
statements hold:"
HOW TO USE INPUT-DEPENDENT SMOOTHING PROPERLY,0.09741060419235512,"1. Let σ1 ≤σ0. Then, for all σ2 : σ1 ≤σ2 ≤σ0, if ξ>(R, σ2) > 0.5, then ξ>(R, σ1) > 0.5."
HOW TO USE INPUT-DEPENDENT SMOOTHING PROPERLY,0.09864364981504316,"2. Let σ1 ≥σ0. Then, for all σ2 : σ1 ≥σ2 ≥σ0, if ξ<(R, σ2) > 0.5, then ξ<(R, σ1) > 0.5."
HOW TO USE INPUT-DEPENDENT SMOOTHING PROPERLY,0.0998766954377312,"Theorem 6 serves as a kind of monotonicity property. The main gain is that now, for each distance
R from x0, we need to pick just two adversaries – the one with biggest σ1 (if bigger than σ0) and
the one with the smallest σ1 (if smaller than σ0). If we cannot certify some point x1 at the distance
R from x0, then we will for sure not be able to certify at least one of the two adversaries with the
most extreme σ1 values."
HOW TO USE INPUT-DEPENDENT SMOOTHING PROPERLY,0.10110974106041924,"This does, however, not sufﬁce for most of the reasonable σ(x) designs, since it might be still too
hard to determine the two most extreme σ1’s at some distance from x0. Therefore, we need to
assume that our σ(x) has a bounded semi-elasticity coefﬁcient r. Then we have a guarantee that
σ(x0) exp(−ra) ≤σ(x1) ≤σ(x0) exp(ra). Thus, we can assume the worst-case extreme σ1’s for
every distance a from x0. Using this, we guarantee the following certiﬁed radius.

put pB = 1 −pA (see Appendix B.5). Since the bigger the semi-elasticity constant of σ(x) is, the
worse certiﬁcations we obtain, it is important to estimate the constant tightly. Even with a good
estimate of r, we still get smaller certiﬁed radiuses in comparison with using the σ(x) exactly, but
that is a prize that is inevitable for the feasibility of the method."
HOW TO USE INPUT-DEPENDENT SMOOTHING PROPERLY,0.1060419235511714,"The practical algorithm is then very easy - we just need to pick sufﬁciently dense space of possible
radiuses and determine the smallest, for which either ξ>(R, σ0 exp(−rR)) or ξ<(R, σ0 exp(rR))
becomes bigger than a half. The only non-trivial part is, how to evaluate the ξ functions. For small
values of R, the exp(−rR) is very close to 1 and from the deﬁnition of ξ functions it is obvious
that this results in extremely big inputs to the cdf and quantile function of NCCHSQ. To avoid
numerical problems, we employ a simple hack where we assume thresholds for σ1 such that for
R small enough, these thresholds are used instead of σ0 exp(±rR)). Unfortunately, the numerical
stability still disables the usage of this method on really high-dimensional datasets like ImageNet.

THE DESIGN OF σ(x) AND EXPERIMENTS"
HOW TO USE INPUT-DEPENDENT SMOOTHING PROPERLY,0.10850801479654747,"The only missing ingredient to ﬁnally being able to use IDRS is the σ(x) function. As we have seen,
this function has to be r-semi-elastic for rather small r and ideally deterministic. Yet it should at
least roughly fulﬁll the requirements imposed by the motivation – it should possess big values for
points far from the decision boundary of f and rather small for points close to it. Adhering to these
restrictions, we use the following function:"

Nk(x) the k nearest neighbors of x and m the normalization constant. Intuitively, if a sample is far
from all other samples, it will be far from the decision boundary, unless the network overﬁts to this
sample. On the other hand, the dense clusters of samples are more likely to be positioned near the
decision boundary, since such clusters have a high leverage on the network’s weights, forcing the
decision boundary to adapt well to the geometry of the cluster. To use such a function, however, we
ﬁrst prove that it is indeed r-semi-elastic.

MNIST (LeCun et al., 1999) datasets, we analyze series of different experimental setups, including
experiments with an input-dependent train-time Gaussian data augmentation. We present a direct
comparison of our method with the constant σ method using evaluation strategy from Cohen et al.

selection are presented in Appendix E). Here, we compare Cohen et al. (2019)’s evaluations for

CIFAR10 and MNIST, respectively), applied on models trained with Gaussian data augmentation,
using constant standard deviation roughly equal to the average test-time σ(x) or test-time σ. For
CIFAR10, these levels of train-time standard deviation are σtr = 0.126, 0.263, 0.53 and for MNIST
σtr = 0.124, 0.258, 0.517. In this way, the levels of σ(x) we use in the direct comparison are spread

et al., 2016; Madry et al., 2017), is based on a very intuitive idea to use adversarial examples for
training. Unfortunately, together with adversarial training, other promising empirical defenses were
subsequently broken by more sophisticated adversarial methods (for instance Carlini & Wagner
(2017); Athalye & Carlini (2018); Athalye et al. (2018), among many others)."

one of the most successful yet is RS. While Lecuyer et al. (2019) introduced the method within
the context of differential privacy, Li et al. (2019) proceeded via the knowledge of R´enyi diver-
gences. Possibly the most prominent work on RS is that of Cohen et al. (2019), where authors fully
established RS and proved tight certiﬁcation guarantees."
RELATED WORK,0.13316892725030827,"Later, a lot of authors further worked with RS. The work of Yang et al. (2020) generalizes the cer-
tiﬁcation provided by Cohen et al. (2019), to certiﬁcations with respect to the general lp norms and
provide the optimal smoothing distributions for each of the norms. Other works point out differ-
ent problems or weaknesses of RS like the curse of dimensionality (Kumar et al., 2020; Hayes,
2020; Wu et al., 2021), robustness vs. accuracy trade-off (Gao et al., 2020) or a shrinking phe-

method, which optimizes directly for the robustness of g via the gradient descent."

for the region Ri. Yet this work partially solves some problems of randomized smoothing, it also
possesses some practical and philosophical issues (see Appendix C). Alfarra et al. (2020); Eiras et al.
(2021); Chen et al. (2021), suggest to optimize for locally optimal σi, for each sample xi from the
test set. A similar strategy is proposed by these works in the training phase, with the intention of
obtaining the base model f that is most suitable for the construction of the smoothed classiﬁer g.
They demonstrate, that by using this input-dependent approach, one can overcome some of the main
problems of randomized smoothing. However, as we demonstrate in Appendix C, their methodology
is not valid and therefore their results are not trustworthy."

CONCLUSIONS"
CONCLUSIONS,0.1381011097410604,"We show in this work that input-dependent randomized smoothing suffers from the curse of dimen-
sionality. In the high-dimensional regime, the usage of input-dependent σ(x) is being put under
strict constraints. The σ(x) function is forced to have very small semi-elasticity. This is in con-
ﬂict with some recent works, which have used the input-dependent randomized smoothing without
mathematical justiﬁcation and therefore claim invalid results. It seems that input-dependent random-
ized smoothing has limited potential of improvement over the classical, constant-σ RS. Moreover,
due to numerical instability, the computation of certiﬁed radiuses on high-dimensional datasets like
ImageNet remains to be an open challenge."
CONCLUSIONS,0.13933415536374846,"On the other hand, we prepare a ready-to-use mathematically underlined framework for the usage
of the input-dependent RS and show, that it works well for small to medium-sized problems. We
also show via extensive experiments, that our concrete design of the σ(x) function reasonably treats
the truncation issue connected to constant-σ RS and is partially capable of mitigating the robust-
ness vs. accuracy one. The most intriguing and promising direction for the future work lies in the
development of new σ(x) functions, which are capable of even better treatment of the mentioned

so smooth, that it might lose some amount of the base classiﬁer’s expressivity. Another reason for the
accuracy drop is also the increase in the number of samples, for which the evaluation is abstained.

SHRINKING PHENOMENON"

following experiment: For our toy base classiﬁer f on our toy dataset, we increase σ and plot the
heatmap of f, g, together with its decision boundary. This experiment is depicted on Figure 9. As
we see from the plots, increasing σ causes several effects. First of all, the heatmap becomes more
and more blurred, what proves, that stronger smoothing implies stronger smoothness."

class is. The shrinkage becomes pronounced from σ = 1. Already for σ = 4, there is hardly
any decision boundary anymore. Generally, as σ −→∞, g will predict the class with the biggest
volume in the input space (in the case of bounded input space, like in image domain, this is very
well deﬁned). For extreme values of sigma, the pA will practically just be the ratio between the
volume of A and the actual volume of the input space (for bounded input spaces)."

present as σ increases - the bounded/convex regions become to shrink, like in Figure 9, while the
unbounded/big/anti-convex regions expand. This is called shrinking phenomenon. Mohapatra et al.
(2020a) investigate this effect rather closely. They deﬁne the shrinkage and vanishing of regions
formally and prove rigorously, that if σ −→∞, bounded regions, or semi-bounded regions (see
Mohapatra et al. (2020a)) will eventually vanish. We formulate the main result in this direction."

of semi-bounded regions. Moreover, they also conduct experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet to
support their theoretical ﬁndings. They also point out serious fairness issue that comes out as a
consequence of the shrinkage phenomenon. For increasing levels of σ, they measure the class-wise
clean accuracy of the smoothed classiﬁer. If f is trained with gaussian data augmentation (what is
known to be a good practice in randomized smoothing), using σ = 0.12, the worst class cat has test
accuracy of 67%, while the best class automobile attains the accuracy of 92%. The ﬁgures, however,
change drastically, if we use σ = 1 instead. In this case, the worst predicted class cat has accuracy
of poor 22%, while ship has reasonable accuracy 68%. As authors claim, this is a consequence of
the fact that samples of cat are situated more in bounded, convex regions, that suffer from shrinking,
while samples of ship are mostly placed in expanded regions of anti-convex shape that will expand
as the σ grows. In addition, the authors also show, that the gaussian data augmentation or adversarial
training will reduce the shrinking phenomenon just partially and for moderate and high values of σ,
this effect will be present anyway."

of dimensionality, because the R´enyi divergence between two isotropic Gaussians with different

whether we could avoid the curse of dimensionality by properly estimating the pB together with pA.
The answer is no. The problem is that the the theory in Section 2 already implicitly works with the
estimate of pB in a form of 1 −pA. The theory would work also with any other estimate of pB.

then this sample xi is being augmented with this σi as an augmentation standard deviation. Authors
call this method pretrain to ﬁnetune. Second, they provide a speciﬁc version of input-dependent
RS. Essentially, they try to overcome the mathematical problems connected to the usage of non-
constant σ(x) by splitting the input space in so called robust regions Ri, where the constant σi is
guaranteed to be used. All the certiﬁed balls are guaranteed to lie within just one of these robust
regions, making sure that within one certiﬁed region, constant level of σ is used. Authors test this

radiuses R, the NCCHSQ functions will get extremely high inputs, making the results numerically
instable. To prevent this, we use a simple trick. Since the more extreme σ1 will we assume in
evaluation at particular distance R, the worse for us, we can prevent numerical issues simply by
putting σt < σ0 and σT > σ0 to be maximal and minimal used σ’s in our evaluation, i.e. the
true σ used will be min{σt, σ0 exp(−rR)} and max{σT , σ0 exp(rR)}. This way, we avoid nu-

are ﬁrst that it decreases the certiﬁcation power, since it assumes σ1’s that are even worse than the
theoretically guaranteed worst-case possibilities and second, more importantly, that it requires some
engineering to design the σt, σT designs. It is submoptimal to put one constant value for these
thresholds, because the numerical problems occur at different ratio thresholds of σ1/σ0 for different
class probabilities pA and the dimension N. This requires to design a speciﬁc σt(pA) and σT (pA)
functions for each dimension N which we want to apply. For instance, we use σt(pA) = 0.9993 +
0.001 log10(pB), and σT (pA) = 1/σt(pA) for CIFAR10, while for MNIST we use σt(pA) =
0.9988 + 0.001 log10(pB), and σT (pA) = 1/σt(pA). To design such functions, one needs to plot
plot real probability of a ball with fixed variances as fcn of dist func-

it computes correctly. As an example, we provide such a plots for well and ill working setups on

originally, we compare this method to constant σ = σb evaluation. Therefore, in average, samples
in our method enjoy bigger values of σ(x). Natural question is, whether we cannot obtain the
same performance boost using just the constant σ method with Cσb > σb set to such value, which
roughly corresponds to the average of σ(xi) for xi, i ∈{1, . . . , T} being the test set. The problem
of using bigger Cσb is, that we encounter performance drop and more severe case of shrinking,

method. Comparing the performance drops of larger constant Cσb and input-dependent σ(x), which
