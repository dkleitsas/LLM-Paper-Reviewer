INTRODUCTION
Search, recommendation, retrieval, and contrastive similarity learning powers many of today’s ma-
chine learning systems. These systems help us organize information at scales that no human could
match. The recent surge in million and billion parameter contrastive learning architectures for vi-
sion and language underscore the growing need to understand these classes of systems (Nayak,
2019; Chen et al., 2020b;a; Radford et al., 2021; Caron et al., 2020). Like classiﬁers and regres-
sors, contrastive systems face a key challenge: richer models can improve performance but hinder
interpretability. In high-risk domains like medicine, incorrect search results can have serious conse-
quences. In other domains, search engine bias can disproportionately ans systematically hide certain
voices (Mowshowitz & Kawaguchi, 2002; Diaz, 2008; Goldman, 2005)."
INTRODUCTION,0.002793296089385475,"Currently, there are several competing techniques to understand a similarity model’s predictions
(Zhu et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2020; Dong et al.; Selvaraju et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017). How-
ever, there is no agreed “best” method and no a formal theory describing an “optimal” search expla-
nation method. We show that the theory of fair credit assignment provides a uniquely determined
and axiomatically grounded approach for “explaining” a trained model’s similarity judgements. In
many cases, existing approaches are special cases of this formalism. This observation allows us to
design variants of these methods that better satisfy the axioms of fair credit assignment and can han-
dle counterfactual or relative explanations. Though we explore this topic through the lens of visual
search, we note that these techniques could also apply to text, tabular, or audio search systems."

function transformation, as shown in the third column of Figure 1. We ﬁnd that second order expla-
nations correspond to a uniquely speciﬁed generalization of the Shapley values (Sundararajan et al.,

BACKGROUND"
BACKGROUND,0.0223463687150838,"This work focuses on search, retrieval, metric learning, and recommendation architectures. Often,
these systems use similarity between objects or learned features (Bengio et al., 2013) to rank, re-
trieve, or suggest content (Bing, 2017; Su & Khoshgoftaar, 2009; Chopra et al., 2005; Radford et al.,
2021). More formally, we refer to systems that use a distance, relevance, or similarity function of
the form: d : X × Y →R to quantify the relationship between items from sets X and Y. In
search and retrieval, X represents the space of search queries and Y represents the space of results,
the function d assigns a relevance to each query result pair. Without loss of generality, we con-
sider d as a “distance-like” function where smaller values indicate more relevance. The expression
arg miny∈Y d(x, y) yields the most relevant result for a query x ∈X."
BACKGROUND,0.025139664804469275,"Specializing this notion yields a variety of different kinds of ML systems. If X = Y = Range(N(·))
where N is an image featurization network such as ResNet50 (He et al., 2016), the formalism yields
a visual search engine or “reverse image search”. Though this work focuses on visual search, we
note that if X is the space of character sequences and Y is the space of webpages, this represents web
search. In recommendation problems, X are users and Y are items, such as songs or news articles.
In this work we aim to extract meaningful “interpretations” or “explanations” of the function d."

MODEL INTERPRETABILITY
The Bias-Variance trade-off (Kohavi et al., 1996) affects all machine learning systems and governs
the relationship between a model’s expressiveness and generalization ability. In data-rich scenarios,
a model’s bias dominates generalization error and increasing the size of the model class can improve
performance. However, increasing model complexity can degrade model interpretability because"

several different methods making it difﬁcult to interpret through model parameter inspection alone."
MODEL INTERPRETABILITY,0.03910614525139665,"To tackle these challenges, some works introduce model classes that are naturally interpretable (Nori
et al., 2019; Hastie & Tibshirani, 1990). Alternatively, other works propose model-agnostic methods
to explain the predictions of classiﬁers and regressors. Many of these approaches explain the local
structure around a speciﬁc prediction. Lundberg & Lee (2017) show that the Shapley value (Shap-
ley, 1951), a measure of fair credit assignment, provides a unique and axiomatically characterized
solution to classiﬁer interpretability (SHAP). Furthermore, they show that Shapley values generalize
LIME, DeepLIFT (Shrikumar et al., 2017), Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (Bach et al., 2015),
and several other methods (ˇStrumbelj & Kononenko, 2014; Datta et al., 2016; Lipovetsky & Con-
klin, 2001; Saabas, 2014). Many works in computer vision use an alternative approach called Class
Activation Maps (CAMs). CAM projects the predicted class of a deep global average pooled (GAP)
convolutional network onto the feature space to create a low resolution heatmap of class-speciﬁc
network attention. GradCAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) generalizes CAM to architectures other than
GAP and can explain a prediction using only a single network evaluation. In Section 4 we show that
CAM, GradCAM, and their analogue for search engine interpretability, Zhu et al. (2019), are also
uniﬁed by the Shapley value and its second order generalization, the Shapley-Taylor index."
FAIR CREDIT ASSIGNMENT AND THE SHAPLEY VALUE,0.04189944134078212,"2.2
FAIR CREDIT ASSIGNMENT AND THE SHAPLEY VALUE
Shapley values provide a principled and axiomatic framework for classiﬁer interpretation. We brieﬂy
overview Shapley values and point readers to Molnar (2020) for more detail. Shapley values orig-
inated in cooperative game theory as the only fair way to allocate the proﬁt of a company to its
employees based on their contributions. To formalize this notion we deﬁne a “coalition game” as a
set N of |N| players and a “value” function v : 2N →R. In cooperative game theory, this function
v represents the expected payout earned by cooperating coalition of players. Shapley (1951) show
that the unique, fair credit assignment to each player, φv(i ∈N), can be calculated as:"

FAIR CREDIT ASSIGNMENT AND THE SHAPLEY VALUE,0.055865921787709494,"Informally, this equation measures the average increase in value that a player i brings to a coalition
S by weighting each increase, v(S ∪{i}) −v(S), by the number of ways this event could have
happened during the formation of the “grand coalition” N. We note that this assignment, φv, is
the unique assignment that satisﬁes four reasonable properties: symmetry under player re-labeling,
no credit assignment to dummy players, linearity (or it’s alternative monotonicity), and efﬁciency
which states that Shapley values should sum to v(N) −v(∅) (Young, 1985). Intuitively, these
axioms require that a fair explanation should treat every feature equally (Symmetry), should not
assign importance to features that are not used (Dummy), should behave linearly when the value
function is transformed (Linear), and should sum to the function’s value (Efﬁciency)."
FAIR CREDIT ASSIGNMENT AND THE SHAPLEY VALUE,0.05865921787709497,"Shapley Values provide a principled way to explain the predictions of a machine learning model.
To connect this work to model interpretability, we can identify the “features” used in a model as
the “players” and interpret the value function, v(S), as the expected prediction of the model when
features N\S are replaced by values from a “background” distribution. This background distribution
allows for “counterfactual” or relative explanations (Goyal et al., 2019)."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.07262569832402235,"There is a considerable body of literature on model interpretability and we mention just a hand-
ful of the works that are particularly related. One of our baseline methods, Dong et al., was one
of the ﬁrst to present a generic visual search engine explanation reminiscent of a Parzen-Window
based estimator. Fong & Vedaldi (2017) introduce a method for explaining classiﬁers based on
meaningful perturbation and Chefer et al. (2021) introduce a method for improving interpretation
for transformer-based classiﬁers. Zhu et al. (2019) lifted CAM to search engines and we ﬁnd that
our Shapley-Taylor based method aligns with their approach for GAP architectures. Singh & Anand
(2019) and Fernando et al. (2019) use LIME and DeepSHAP to provide ﬁrst-order interpretations of
text but do not apply their methods to images. Ancona et al. (2019) introduce a distribution propaga-
tion approach for improving the estimation of Shapley Values for deep models and can be combined
with our approach. Many works implicitly use components that align with Shapley-Taylor indices
for particular functions. Works such as Fischer et al. (2015a); Sun et al. (2020); Wang et al. (2020a);
Chen et al. (2020c); Hou et al. (2019) use feature correlation layers to estimate and utilize corre-
spondences between images. We show these layers are equivalent to Shapley-Taylor indices on the
GAP architecture, and this allows create a correlation layer that handles counterfactual backgrounds.
Other recent works have used learned co-attention within transformer architectures to help pool and
share information across multiple domain types (Wei et al., 2020). Fu et al. (2020) attempt to learn
a variant of GradCAM that better aligns with axioms similar to Shapley Values by adding efﬁciency
regularizers. The method is not guaranteed to satisfy the axioms but is more “efﬁcient”."
RELATED WORK,0.07541899441340782,"We rely on several works to extend Shapley values to more complex interactions. Harsanyi (1963)
generalized the Shapely value by introducing a “dividend” that, when split and distributed among
players, yields the Shapley values. Owen (1972) introduces an equivalent way to extend Shapley
values using a multi-linear extension of the game’s characteristic function. Sundararajan et al. (2020)
introduce the Shapley-Taylor index and show is equivalent to the Lagrangian remainder of Owen’s
multi-linear extension. Integrated Hessians (Janizek et al., 2020) enable estimation of a second-
order variant of the Aumann-Shapley values and we use this approach to create a more principled
second-order interpretation method for differentiable search engines."

to handle background distributions. These extra terms broaden the applicability of VEDML and
we demonstrate their effect on explanations in Figure 3. In particular, we explain why two guitar
players are similar in general (no background distribution), and relative to the second-best result of a
guitar. Without a background, the explanation focuses on the guitar. However, when the explanation
is relative to an image of a guitar the explanation focuses instead on the “tie-breaking” similarities,
like the matching player. With counterfactual queries one can better understand a model’s rationale
behind relative similarity judgements and this can help in domains such as search engine optimiza-
tion and automated medical diagnosis. We refer to Equation 3 as the Search Activation Map (SAM)
in analogy with the Class Activation Map. We note that in non-GAP architectures, VEDML requires
Taylor approximating nonlinear components. This heuristic corresponds estimating the Shapley val-
ues for a linear approximation of the true value function. For nonlinear architectures such as those

Though the Harsanyi Dividends and Shapley-Taylor indices provide a robust way to allocate credit,
they are difﬁcult to compute. The authors of the Shapley-Taylor indices provide a sampling-based
approximation, but this requires estimating each interaction term separately and scales poorly as
dimensionality increases. To make this approach more tractable for high dimensional functions we
draw a parallel to the uniﬁcation of LIME with Shapley values through a linear regression weight-
ing kernel. In particular, one can efﬁciently approximate Shapley values by randomly sampling
coalitions, evaluating the value function, and ﬁtting a weighted linear map from coalition vectors to
function values. We ﬁnd that this connection between Shapley values and weighted linear models
naturally lifts to a weighted quadratic estimation problem in the “second-order” case. In particular,

formation into weighted quadratic model with a term for each distinct coalition |S| ≤2. This
allows one to approximate all Shapley-Taylor indices of k = 2 with a single sampling proce-
dure, and often requires 10× fewer function evaluations to achieve the same estimation accu-
racy. We show this speedup in Figure 5 on randomly initialized 15-dimensional deep networks.
A detailed description of this and other experiments in this work are in the supplement.
We
ﬁnd that one can further speed up the method by directly sampling from the induced distribu-
tion (Kernel-Direct) as opposed to randomly sampling coalitions and calculating weights (Kernel-
Weighting). This direct sampling can be achieved by ﬁrst sampling the size of the coalition from
p(s) ∝(|N| −1)/(
 s
2

(|N| −s)) and then randomly sampling a coalition of that size. When our
masking function operates on super-pixels, we refer to this as the second-order generalization of Ker-
nel SHAP. This also gives insight into the proper form for a second-order generalization of LIME. In
particular we add L1 regularization (Tibshirani, 1996) and replace our kernel with a local similarity,
Λ(S) = exp(−λ|mask(x, S); mask(y, S) −x; y|2
2) where “;” represents concatenation, to create a
higher-order analogue of LIME. Finally we note that certain terms of the kernel are undeﬁned due
to the presence of
 s
2

and |N| −|S| in the denominator. These “inﬁnite” weight terms encode hard
constraints in the linear system and correspond to the efﬁciency axiom. In practice we enumerate
these terms and give them a very large weight (108) in our regression. We reiterate that our ker-
nel approximator converges to the same, uniquely-deﬁned, values as prior sampling approaches but
requires signiﬁcantly fewer function evaluations."

has the extra terms allow counterfactual explanations against different background signals. Like
in the ﬁrst-order case, this closed form only holds in the GAP architecture. To extend the method
in a principled way we use our second-order kernel approximator and refer to this as second-order
KSAM. We also introduce a generalization using a higher order analogue of Integrated Gradients,
Integrated Hessians (Janizek et al., 2020), applied to our feature maps. We refer to this as second-
order IGSAM. In Section A.3 of the Supplement we prove that this approach is proportional to the
Shapley-Taylor indices for the GAP architecture. We can visualize these second-order explanations
by aggregating these Shapley-Taylor indices into a matrix with query image locations as rows and
retrieved locations as columns. Using this matrix, we can “project” signals from a query to retrieved
image. We show a few examples of attention projection using our second-order SAM in Figure 4."

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION"
EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION,0.2430167597765363,"First Order Evaluation
Evaluating the quality of an interpretability method requires careful ex-
perimental design and is independent from what “looks good” to our human eye. If a model explana-
tion method produces “semantic” connections between images it should be because to the underlying
model is sensitive to these semantics. As a result, we adopt the evaluation strategy of Lundberg &
Lee (2017), which measures how well the model explanation approximates the expected inﬂuence
of individual features. In particular, these works calculate each feature’s importance, replace the top
n% of features with background signal, and measure the effect on the function. A good model inter-
pretability method should cause the replacement of the most important features, and hence cause the
largest expected change in the function. We refer to this metric as the “Faithfulness” of an interpre-
tation measure as it directly measures how well an interpretation method captures the behavior of an
underlying model. Figure 7 in the Supplement diagrams this process for clarity. In our experiments
we blur the top 30% of image pixels to compute faithfulness. For those methods that permit it, we
also measure how much the explanation violates the efﬁciency axiom. In particular we compare the
sum of explanation coefﬁcients with the value of v(N) −v(∅) and refer to this as the “Inefﬁciency”
of the method. For additional details and evaluation code please see Section A.2 in the Supplement."

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION,0.24860335195530725,"Second Order Evaluation
In the second-order case we adopt the evaluation strategy of Janizek
et al. (2020) which introduce a analogous second-order faithfulness measure. In particular, we mea-
sure how well model explanations approximate the expected interaction between two features. To
achieve this, we select an object from the query image, use the second order explanation to ﬁnd the
corresponding object in the retrieved image, censor all but these two objects. We measure the new
similarity as a measure of Faithfulness and illustrate this process in In Figure 6. We additionally
quantify the inefﬁciency of several second-order methods as well as their effectiveness for semantic
segmentation label propagation. In particular, we measure how well the explanation method can
project a source object onto a target object. We treat this as a binary segmentation problem and mea-
sure the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of the projected object with respect to the true object
mask. We note that mIoU is not a direct measurement of interpretation quality, but it can be useful for
those intending to use model-interpretation methods for label propagation (Ahn et al., 2019; Wang
et al., 2020b). These results demonstrate that axiomatically grounded model explanation methods
such as IG SAM could offer improvement on downstream tasks. Because human evaluations intro-
duce biases such as preference for compact or smoothness explanations, we consider Mechanical
Turk (Paolacci et al., 2010) studies outside the scope of this work."
EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION,0.25139664804469275,"Datasets
We evaluate our methods on the Pascal VOC (Everingham et al., 2010) and MSCoCo
Caesar et al. (2018) semantic segmentation datasets. To compute ﬁrst and second order faithfulness
we mine pairs of related images with shared object classes. We use the MoCo V2 (Chen et al.,
2020b) unsupervised image representation method to featurize the training and validation sets. For
each image in the validation set we choose a random object from the image and ﬁnd the training
image that contains an object of the same class (Hamilton et al., 2020)."
EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION,0.2541899441340782,"Results
In Table 1 and Table 4 of the Supplement we report experimental results for PascalVOC
and MSCoCo respectively. We evaluate across visual search engines created from four different
backbone networks: DenseNet121 (Huang et al., 2017), MoCo v2 (Chen et al., 2020b), ResNet50
(He et al., 2016), and VGG11 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) using cosine similarity on GAP fea-
tures. As baselines we include VESM, SBSM, and SAM which generalizes (Zhu et al., 2019). We
note that SBSM was not originally presented as a second-order method, and we describe how it can
be lifted to this higher order setting in Section A.11 of the Supplement. We also evaluate several
existing classiﬁer explanation approaches applied to our search explanation value functions such
as Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017a) on image pixels, Partition SHAP (Lundberg),
LIME, Kernel SHAP (KSHAP), and GradCAM (GCAM) on deep feature maps (Selvaraju et al.,
2017). For second-order variants of LIME and SHAP we used the local weighting kernel and our
Shapley-Taylor approximation kernel from Section 5.2. Overall, several key trends appear. First,
Shapley and Aumann-Shapley based approaches tend to be the most faithful and efﬁcient methods,
but at the price of longer computation time. One method that strikes a balance between speed and
quality is our Integrated Gradient generalization of CAM which has both high faithfulness, low inef-
ﬁciency, and only requires a handful of network evaluations (∼102). Furthermore, grey-box feature
interpretation methods like SAM and IG SAM tend to perform better for label propagation. Finally,
our methods beat existing baselines in several different categories and help to complete the space of
higher order interpretation approaches. We point readers to the Section A.2 for additional details,
compute information, and code."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.25977653631284914,"In this work we have presented a uniquely speciﬁed and axiomatic framework for model-agnostic
search, retrieval, and metric learning interpretability using the theory of Harsanyi dividends. We
characterize search engine interpretability methods as either “ﬁrst” or “second” order methods de-
pending on whether they extract the most important areas or pairwise correspondences, respectively.
We show that Shapley values of a particular class of value functions generalize many ﬁrst-order
methods, and this allows us to ﬁx issues present in existing approaches and extend these approaches
to counterfactual explanations. For second order methods we show that Shapley-Taylor indices gen-
eralize the work of Zhu et al. (2019) and use our framework to introduce generalizations of LIME,
SHAP, and GradCAM. We apply these methods to extract image correspondences from opaque-box
similarity models, a feat not yet presented in the literature. To accelerate estimation higher order
Shapley-Taylor indices, we contribute a new weighting kernel that requires 10× fewer function eval-
uations. Finally, we show this game-theoretic formalism yields methods that are more “faithful” to
the underlying model and better satisfy efﬁciency axioms across several visual similarity methods."

EVALUATION AND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS"
REFERENCES,0.5111731843575419,"Figure 7: First-order interpretation evaluation strategy. A good method should highlight pixels in the
query image (top left and middle) that, when censored (top right), have the largest possible impact
on the cosine distance."
REFERENCES,0.5139664804469274,"Models:
Our evaluation experiments use visual similarity systems built from “backbone” net-
works that featurize images and compare their similarity using cosine distance. We consider su-
pervised backbones and contrastive unsupervised backbones. In particular, ResNet50 (He et al.,
2016), VGG11 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), and DenseNet121 (Huang et al., 2017) are trained
with human classiﬁcation annotations from the ImageNet dataset (Deng et al., 2009) and MoCo V2
is trained using unsupervised contrastive learning on ImageNet. We use torchvision (Marcel & Ro-
driguez, 2010) based model implementations and pre-trained weights except for MocoV2 which we
download from He & Wu (2021) (800 epoch model). For kernel convergence experiments in Figure
5 we use randomly initialized three layer deep networks with Glorot (Glorot et al., 2011) initializa-
tion, rectiﬁed linear unit activations, and a 20 dimensional hidden layer. We note that the functional
form is not of much importance for these experiments so long as the function is nonlinear and
non-quadratic. We provide an additional example in Figure 10 on random 15 dimensional Boolean
functions formed by enumerating and summing all possible variable products and weighting each
by a uniform coefﬁcient between 0 and 10."
REFERENCES,0.5167597765363129,"Data:
For evaluations within Table 1 we use the Pascal VOC (Everingham et al., 2010) dataset. In
particular we form a paired image dataset by using MoCo V2 to featurize the training and validation
sets. All experiments use images that have been bi-linearly resized to 224 × 224 pixels. For each
image in the PascalVOC validation set we choose a random segmentation class that contains over
5% of image pixels. We then ﬁnd each validation image’s closest “Conditional Nearest Neighbor”
(Hamilton et al., 2020) from the images of the training set of the chosen segmentation class. We
use cosine similarity between MoCoV2 deep features to ﬁnd nearest neighbors. With this dataset of
pairs, we can then compute our ﬁrst and second order evaluation metrics. We provide instructions
for downloading the pairs of images in the attached code. We note that our approach for selecting
pairs of images with matching segmentation labels allow for measuring Faithfulness and success in
label propagation as measured by mIoU."
REFERENCES,0.5195530726256983,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
REFERENCES,0.5223463687150838,"Metrics:
Our attached code contains implementations all metrics for preciseness but we include
descriptions of metrics here for clarity. To measure ﬁrst order faithfulness, we take a given validation
image and training image from our dataset of paired images and compute the ﬁrst order heat-map
over the validation image. We then blur the top 30% of pixels by blurring the image with a 25 × 25
pixel blur kernel and replacing the top 30% of original image pixels with those from the blurred
image. The drop in cosine similarity between the unblurred images and the unblurred training and
blurred validation image is the ﬁrst order faithfulness. We illustrate our ﬁrst-order evaluation strategy
in Figure 7."
REFERENCES,0.5251396648044693,"For our second-order evaluation, we use the ground truth semantic segmentation mask of the train-
ing image as a “query” attention signal. We then use the second-order interpretation methods to
“project” this attention to the “retrieved” validation image. We censor all but the most-attended
pixels in the retrieved image. The size of the remaining pixels matches the size of the validation
image’s selected semantic segmentation mask. In the second-order case we additionally measure
the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of the resulting mask compared to the ground-truth re-
trieved image segmentation. A good approach should attend to jut the pixels of the segmentation
class and thus yield a mIoU of 1 (maximum value) as a binary segmentation problem. We illustrate
our second-order evaluation strategy in Figure 6."
REFERENCES,0.5279329608938548,"Finally, for those methods that permit it, we measure how much they violate the efﬁciency axiom by
summing the interpretation coefﬁcients and comparing with v(N) −v(∅). In the ﬁrst order setting
v(N) is the similarity between query and retrieved image, and v(∅) is the similarity between query
and a blurred retrieved image (with 25 pixel blur). In the second order setting v(∅) represents the
similarity when both images are blurred. For SAM-based methods we replace features with those
from blurred images. To compute the sum of interpretation coefﬁcients for kernel methods we sum
over Shapley values in the ﬁrst order case and over Shapley-Taylor indices of order k ≤2 in the
second-order case. For Partition SHAP Lundberg we sum coefﬁcients over all pixels. For Integrated
Hessian’s we sum over all ﬁrst and second order coefﬁcients as described in Janizek et al. (2020)."

For ﬁrst order explanations we use the ofﬁcial implementation of Image-
LIME (Ribeiro, 2021) and use the SHAP package for Integrated Gradients, Partition SHAP, and
Kernel SHAP (Lundberg). We re-implement SBSM and VESM in PyTorch from the instructions
provided in their papers. For sampling procedures such as LIME, Kernel SHAP, and Partition
SHAP we use 5000 function evaluations. For ﬁrst and second-order super-pixel based methods
(LIME, Kernel-SHAP) we use the SLIC superpixel method (Achanta et al., 2010) provided in the
Scipy library (Virtanen et al., 2020) with 50 segments, compactness = 10, and σ = 3. For SBSM
we use a window size of 20 pixels and a stride of 3 pixels. We batch function evaluations with
minibatch size 64 for backbone networks and 64 × 20 for SAM based methods. For all background
distributions we blur the images with a 25-pixel blur kernel with the exception of LIME and SBSM
which use mean color backgrounds."

algorithms, but implement all methods within PyTorch for uniform comparison. For SBSM, Ker-

For IGSAM we use the expected Hessians method referenced in the supplement of Janizek et al.

eliminate IO bottlenecks. We standardize experiments using Azure Machine Learning and run each
experiment on a separate virtual machine to avoid slowdowns due to scarce CPU or GPU resources."

model. Because GradCAM spatially averages the gradients prior to taking the inner product with the
feature map all features are treated equally regardless of how they are used. In this example, depicted
in Figure 8, positive contributions from the right side of the image are extended to the left side of the
image despite the fact that the mask, M stops these features from impacting the prediction. Using
a Shapley or Aumann-Shapley approximator on the feature space does not suffer from this effect as

GENERALIZING SBSM TO JOINT SEARCH ENGINE INTERPRETABILITY"
REFERENCES,0.729050279329609,"Before generalizing SBSM (Dong et al.) to joint interpretability we will review the original imple-
mentation for marginal interpretability. SBSM uses a sliding square mask and multiple evaluations
of the search engine to determine which regions of the image are important for similarity. More for-
mally, let q, and r represent the pixels of the query image and retrieved image. Let M s
ij(q) represent
the result of replacing a square of pixels of size s × s centered at pixel (i, j) with a “background
value” which in our case is black. SBSM “slides” this mask across the query image and compares
the similarity between the masked query and retrieved image. These masked similarity values are

areas that are critical to the similarity, this will result in wij > 0. Finally, an attention mask on the
query image is formed by a weighted average of the masks used to censor the images. For square
masks, this can be achieved efﬁciently using a deconvolution with a kernel of ones of size s × s on
the weight matrix w. We also note that instead of evaluating the (expensive) distance computation
d for every pixel (i, j), one can also sample pixels to censor. We use this approach in our joint
generalization."

HW,0.9972067039106145,"The term “axiomatic” can mean different things to different readers. When this work refers to
“axiomatic” methods we refer to methods that approximate the uniquely speciﬁed explanation val-
ues dictated by the axioms of fair-credit assignment. In the ﬁrst-order case, these explanations are
the Shapey Values and satisfy the axioms of linearity, efﬁciency, dummy, and symmetry. In the
higher-order case these fair credit assignments are the Shapley-Taylor Indices and satisfy analogous
axioms Sundararajan et al. (2020). We note that our methods converge to the true Shapley and
Shapley-Taylor indices and thus the deviations that arise as part of convergence induce correspond-
ing deviations from the axioms of fair credit assignment. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that these deviations
become negligible as our methods converge to the true Shapley and Shapley-Taylor values. This
starkly contrasts the behavior of methods that do not converge to values that satisfy the axioms of
fair credit assignment such as GradCAM as shown in Figure 8."
