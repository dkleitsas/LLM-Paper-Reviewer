ABSTRACT,0.0014005602240896359,Abstract
ABSTRACT,0.0028011204481792717,"Graph neural networks, which typically exchange information between local neigh-
bors, often struggle to capture long-range interactions (LRIs) within the graph.
Building a graph hierarchy via graph pooling methods is a promising approach
to address this challenge; however, hierarchical information propagation cannot
entirely take over the role of local information aggregation. To balance locality
and hierarchy, we integrate the local and hierarchical structures, represented by
intra- and inter-graphs respectively, of a multi-scale graph hierarchy into a single
mega graph. Our proposed MeGraph model consists of multiple layers alternating
between local and hierarchical information aggregation on the mega graph. Each
layer first performs local-aware message-passing on graphs of varied scales via
the intra-graph edges, then fuses information across the entire hierarchy along
the bidirectional pathways formed by inter-graph edges. By repeating this fusion
process, local and hierarchical information could intertwine and complement each
other. To evaluate our model, we establish a new Graph Theory Benchmark de-
signed to assess LRI capture ability, in which MeGraph demonstrates dominant
performance. Furthermore, MeGraph exhibits superior or equivalent performance
to state-of-the-art models on the Long Range Graph Benchmark. The experimental
results on commonly adopted real-world datasets further demonstrate the broad
applicability of MeGraph. 1"

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.0056022408963585435,"Graph-structured data, such as social networks, traffic networks, and biological data, are prevalent
across a plethora of real-world applications. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged
as a powerful tool for modeling and understanding the intricate relationships and patterns present in
such data. Most existing GNNs learn graph representations by iteratively aggregating information
from individual nodes’ local neighborhoods through the message-passing mechanism. Despite their
effectiveness, these GNNs struggle to capture long-range interactions (LRIs) between nodes in the
graph. For instance, when employing a 4-layer vanilla GNN on the 9-node (A to I) graph (as shown
in Fig. 1), the receptive field of node A is limited to 4-hop neighbors, making the aggregation of
information from nodes G, H, and I into node A quite challenging. While GNNs could theoretically
incorporate information from nodes n-hops away with n-layers of message passing, this often leads
to over-smoothing and over-squashing issues [17, 3] when n is large."

INTRODUCTION,0.0196078431372549,"Figure 1: Illustration of the graph pooling operation, graph pyramid, and mega graph. Graph pooling is a
downsampling process comprising SELECT, CONNECT, and REDUCE steps. It begins by selecting subsets for
grouping and each subset collapses into a new node in the pooled graph. Next, it forms new edges by merging
the original ones, and finally calculates the pooled graph’s features. In this graph, nodes A B C, D E F, and G H
I are pooled into nodes 1, 2, and 3 respectively, while the edges (B, E) and (C, D) are merged into (1, 2). Graph
Pyramid involves multi-scaled graphs derived from iterative graph pooling, with the height indicating different
scales and h = 1 symbolizing the original graph. Mega Graph is formed by connecting the graph pyramid
using inter-graph edges, which are the by-products of graph pooling."
INTRODUCTION,0.02100840336134454,"One mainstream solution to this problem involves constructing a multi-scale graph hierarchy through
graph pooling methods. Previous efforts, such as Graph UNets [22] and HGNet [47], have attempted
to broaden the receptive field using this strategy. They downsample and upsample the graph,
aggregating information along the hierarchy. However, hierarchical information propagation cannot
take over the role of local information aggregation. To illustrate, consider the graph hierarchy depicted
in Fig. 1. The information propagated along the hierarchy from node B to nodes D, E, and F tends to
be similar since they share the common path B-1-X-2. However, in the original graph, node B holds
different degrees of importance to nodes D, E, and F as they are 2, 1, and 3 hops away respectively."
INTRODUCTION,0.022408963585434174,"To balance the importance of locality and hierarchy, we amalgamate the local and hierarchical
structures of a multi-scale graph hierarchy into a single mega graph as depicted in Fig. 1, where we
refer to the local structure as intra-graph edges and hierarchical structure as inter-graph edges. Based
on this mega graph, we introduce our MeGraph model consisting of n Mee layers. Each layer first
performs local-aware message-passing on graphs of varied scales via the intra-graph edges and then
fuses information across the whole hierarchy along the bidirectional pathways formed by inter-graph
edges. This method enables hierarchically fused information to circulate within local structures and
allows locally fused information to distribute across the hierarchy. By repeating this fusion process,
local and hierarchical information could intertwine and complement each other. Moreover, to support
flexible graph pooling ratios when constructing the multi-scale graph hierarchy, we propose a new
graph pooling method S-EdgePool that improves from EdgePool [13]."
INTRODUCTION,0.023809523809523808,"In our experiments, We first evaluate MeGraph’s capability to capture Long Range interactions
(LRIs). We establish a Graph Theory Benchmark comprising four tasks related to shortest paths
and one related to connected components. MeGraph demonstrates superior performance compared
with many competitive baselines. MeGraph also achieves comparable or superior performance than
the state-of-the-art on the Long Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) [17]. In addition, we perform
extensive experiments on widely-used real-world datasets that are not explicitly tailored for assessing
the capacity to capture LRIs. These include the GNN benchmark [15] and OGB-G datasets [28].
In these tests, MeGraph demonstrates superior or equivalent performance compared to the baseline
models, suggesting its broad applicability and effectiveness."
INTRODUCTION,0.025210084033613446,"The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: 1) Mega graph and novel architec-
ture: we propose the mega graph, a multi-scale graph formed by intra- and inter-graph edges, where
the message-passing over the mega graph naturally balances locality and hierarchy. On this basis, we
introduce a novel architecture MeGraph, which alternates information aggregation along the intra-
and inter-edges of the mega graph. This fusion process intertwines local and hierarchical information,
leading to mutual benefits. 2) Hierarchical information fusion: we design a bidirectional pathway
to facilitate information fusion among the hierarchies. 3) S-EdgePool: we enhance EdgePool into
S-EdgePool, allowing an adjustable pooling ratio. 4) Benchmark and Evaluations: we establish a
new graph theory benchmark to evaluate the ability of models to capture LRIs. In these evaluations,
MeGraph exhibits dominant performance. Additionally, MeGraph achieves new SOTA in one task of
LRGB and shows better or comparable performance compared with baselines on popular real-world
datasets."

Notations, Backgrounds and Preliminaries"
INTRODUCTION,0.028011204481792718,"Let G = (V, E) be a graph with node set V (of cardinality N v) and edge set E (of cardinality N e). The
edge set can be represented as E = {(sk, tk)}k=1:Ne, where sk and tk are the indices of the source
and target nodes connected by edge k. We define XG as features of graph G, which is a combination
of global (graph-level) features uG, node features VG, and edge features EG. Accordingly, we
use VG
i to represent the features of a specific node vi, and EG
k denotes the features of a specific
edge (sk, tk). We may abuse the notations by omitting the superscript G when there is no context
ambiguity."

Graph Network (GN) Block"
INTRODUCTION,0.03081232492997199,"We adopt the Graph Network (GN) block design in accordance with the GN framework [6]. In our
notation, a GN block accepts a graph G and features X = (u, V, E) as inputs, and produces new
features X′ = (u′, V′, E′). A full GN block [6] includes the following update steps. In each of these
steps, ϕ denotes an update function, typically implemented as a neural network:"

Graph Pooling"
GRAPH POOLING,0.036414565826330535,"Graph pooling operation downsamples the graph structure and its associated features while ensuring
the preservation of structural and semantic information inherent to the graph. Drawing from the
SRC framework [23], we identify graph pooling as a category of functions,POOL, that maps a graph
G = (V, E) with N v nodes and features XG to a reduced graph ˜G = (˜V, ˜E) with N ˜v nodes and new
features X ˜G. Here, N ˜v ≤N v and ( ˜G, X ˜G) = POOL(G, XG)."
GRAPH POOLING,0.037815126050420166,"The SRC framework deconstructs the POOL operation into SELECT, REDUCE, and CONNECT functions,
which encompass most existing graph pooling techniques. We reinterpret these functions in our own
notation as follows:"

ˆG) = SELECT(G, XG);
˜G = CONNECT(G, ˆG, X
ˆG); X
˜G = REDUCE(XG, ˆG, X
ˆG).
(1)"
GRAPH POOLING,0.04061624649859944,"As shown in Fig. 1, the SELECT establishes N ˜v nodes for the pooled graph, and each node ˜v
corresponds to a subset of nodes S˜v ⊆V in the input graph. This creates an undirected bipartite
graph ˆG = (ˆV, ˆE), with ˆV = V ∪˜V and (v, ˜v) ∈ˆE if and only if v ∈S˜v. We refer to this graph ˆG as
the inter-graph, a larger graph that links nodes in the input graph G with nodes in the pooled graph ˜G.
The SELECT function can be generalized to include inter-graph features X ˆG. As an example, edge
weights can be introduced for some edge (ˆsk, ˆtk) in graph ˆG to gauge the importance of node ˆsk from
the input graph contributing to node ˆtk in the pooled graph."
GRAPH POOLING,0.04201680672268908,"The CONNECT function reconstructs the edge set ˜E between the nodes in ˜V of the pooled graph ˜G
based on the original edges in E and the inter-graph edges in ˆE. The REDUCE function calculates
the graph features X ˜G of graph ˜G by aggregating input graph features XG, taking into account both
the inter-graph ˆG and features X ˆG. In a similar vein to the relationship between graph lifting and
coarsening, we define the EXPAND function for graph features, which serves as the inverse of the
REDUCE function: XG = EXPAND(X ˜G, ˆG, X ˆG)."

Connecting Multi-scale Graphs into a Mega Graph"
CONNECTING MULTI-SCALE GRAPHS INTO A MEGA GRAPH,0.05042016806722689,"Similar to the concept of an image pyramid [1], a graph pyramid is constructed by stacking multi-
scale graphs, which are obtained through iterative downsampling of the graph using a graph pooling
technique. Formally, in alignment with the definition of an image feature pyramid [39], we define
a graph feature pyramid as a set of graphs G1:h := {Gi}i=1,··· ,h and their corresponding features
XG1:h := {XGi}i=1,··· ,h. Here, G1 represents the original graph, XG1 signifies the initial features, h
stands for the height, and (Gi, XGi) = POOL(Gi−1, XGi−1) for i > 1."

MODULE CHOICE AND INNOVATION,0.08683473389355742,"and ability to naturally preserve the graph’s connectivity through edge contraction. However, edge
contraction is applied only to the edges in a specific maximal matching of the graph’s nodes [13],
thereby setting a lower limit of 50% to the pooling ratio ηv. This constraint implies that a minimum
of log2 N pooling operations is required to reduce a graph of N nodes to a single node. To address
this limitation, we propose the Stridden EdgePool (S-EdgePool), which allows for a variable pooling
stride."
MODULE CHOICE AND INNOVATION,0.08823529411764706,"The principle behind S-EdgePool involves dynamically tracking the clusters of nodes created by the
contraction of selected edges. Similar to EdgePool, edges are processed in descending order based on
their scores. When an edge is contracted, if both ends do not belong to the same node cluster, the
two clusters containing the endpoints of the edge merge. The current edge can be contracted if the
resulting cluster contains no more than τc nodes after this edge’s contraction. The iteration stops
prematurely once a pooling ratio, ηv, is achieved. During pooling, each node cluster is pooled as a
new node. When τc = 2, S-EdgePool reverts to the original EdgePool. The algorithm’s details and
pseudocode are available in App. C.2."

COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND DISCUSSION,0.09523809523809523,"The overall complexity of the MeGraph model is contingent on the height h, the number of Mee
layers n, the chosen modules, and the corresponding hyperparameters. Let D be the embedding
size, V the number of nodes, and E the number of edges in the input graph G. The time complexity
of S-Edgepool is O(ED+E log E), and that of a GFuN layer is O(V D2+ED). Assuming both
the pooling ratios of nodes and edges are η, the total time complexity to construct the mega graph
MG becomes O((ED + E log E)/(1 −η)), where Ph−1
i=0 ηi < 1/(1 −η). Similarly, the total time
complexity of an Mee layer is O((V D2 + ED)/(1 −η)). This complexity is equivalent to a typical
GNN layer if we consider 1/(1 −η) as a constant (for instance, it is a constant of 2 when η = 0.5)."

Ablation Study"
ABLATION STUDY,0.1792717086834734,"Hierarchy vs. Locality. We study the impact of the height h and the number of Mee layers n on four
synthetic datasets introduced in [61], which are BAShape, BACommunity, TreeCycle, and TreeGrid.
Each dataset contains one graph formed by attaching multiple motifs to a base graph. The motif can
be a ‘house’-shaped network (BAShape, BACommunity), six-node cycle (TreeCycle), or 3-by-3 grid
(TreeGrid). The task is to identify the nodes of the motifs in the fused graph."
ABLATION STUDY,0.18067226890756302,"As shown in Fig. 4, we can observe clear improvements in performance as the height h and the number
of layers n increase when using EdgePool. Although increasing height shows better improvements,
both hierarchy and locality are indispensable in TreeCycle and TreeGrid tasks. In App. F.5, we show
that the conclusion also holds on BAShape and BACommunity datasets, except that the accuracy
is already saturated with height h = 2. The significance of integrating locality with hierarchy is
also demonstrated in the CLUSTER task, as presented in Table 4. Here, MeGraph reaches 68.6%
accuracy, which is markedly higher than the 50.4% accuracy achieved by both the n=1 baseline and
Graph-UNets."
ABLATION STUDY,0.18207282913165265,"Varying the Pooling Method. We varied the graph pooling with two non-learnable pooling methods,
Louvain [8] and Random. On the TreeCycle and TreeGrid datasets, as depicted in Fig. 4, Louvain
achieves comparable accuracy to EdgePool, while MeGraph using random pooling matches the
performance of the h = 1 variant of MeGraph. These observations indicate that: 1) a well-structured
hierarchy crafted by suitable graph pooling methods enhances MeGraph’s ability to harness hierarchi-
cal information; and 2) despite the disruption from a randomly constructed hierarchy, the MeGraph
model effectively taps into the local structure of the original graph (also discussed in App. D.2)."
ABLATION STUDY,0.18347338935574228,"We further studied the impact of the node pooling ratio ηv and the maximum cluster size τc in
S-EdgePool by perturbing these parameters. As indicated in Table 1, the best variant (ηv=0.3,τc=4)
achieved a regression error about 3x smaller (0.675) compared to the original EdgePool (τc=2 with
an error of 2.215). This suggests the benefit of having a flexible pooling stride. Moreover, the mega
graph produced by S-EdgePool can vary significantly with different parameters. In App. F.2, we
visualized the resulting graph hierarchy to illustrate the difference between different S-EdgePool
variants. However, irrespective of the parameter set used, MeGraph consistently outperforms h = 1
baselines. This suggests that MeGraph exhibits robustness against different architectures of the mega
graph."

decline from 0.675 to 1.203 (smaller is better). This finding suggests that other hierarchical GNNs
might also benefit from replacing the unpool operation with a convolution over the inter-graph edges."

FPN [39], UNet++ [67], and some recent approaches [63, 41, 38, 37]. HRNet [53] is a similar method
compared to MeGraph. HRNet alternates between multi-resolution convolutions and multi-resolution
fusion by stridden convolutions. However, the above methods are developed for image data. The key
difference compared to these approaches is that the multi-scale feature fusion in MeGraph is along the
inter-graph edges, which is not as well structured as the pooling operation in image data. For graph
networks, the GraphFPN [65] builds a graph feature pyramid according to the image feature pyramid
and superpixel hierarchy. It applies GNN layers on the hierarchical graph to exchange information
within the graph pyramid. Existing works [22, 20, 47, 30] have also explored similar ideas in graph-
structured data. Our approach aligns with the broader concept of multi-scale information fusion, but
it is the first method that builds a mega graph using graph pooling operations and alternates local and
hierarchical information aggregation."
RELATED WORK,0.19327731092436976,"Graph Pooling Methods. Graph pooling is an important part of hierarchical graph representation
learning. There have been some traditional graph pooling methods like METIS [32] in early liter-
ature. Recently, many learning-based graph pooling methods have been proposed, including the
DiffPool [62], TopKPool [22], SAG pool [36], EdgePool [13], MinCutPool [7], Structpool [64], and
MEWISPool [44], etc. In this work, we utilize S-EdgePool improved from EdgePool to build the
mega graph, while this module can be substituted with any of the above-mentioned pooling methods."
RELATED WORK,0.19467787114845939,"Graph Neural Network (GNN) Layers. The GNN layer is the core module of graph representation
learning models. Typical GNNs include the GCN [34], GraphSage [24], GAT [52, 9], GIN [58],
PNA [12]. MeGraph adopts the full GN block [6] by removing part of links in the module as an
elementary block, and similarly this can be replaced by any one of the popular GNN blocks."

Limitations and Future Work"
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK,0.19747899159663865,"The MeGraph model suffers from some limitations. The introduced mega graph architecture inevitably
increases both the number of trainable parameters and tuneable hyper-parameters. The flexible choices
of many modules in MeGraph post burdens on tuning the architecture on specific datasets. For future
research, MeGraph encourages new graph pooling methods to yield edge features in addition to
node features, when mapping the input graph to the pooled graph. It is also possible to improve
MeGraph using adaptive computational steps [49]. Another direction is to apply some expressive but
computationally expensive models like Transformers [51] and Neural Logic Machines [14, 57] (only)
over the pooled small-sized graphs."

EdgePool [13]. We further introduce the pooling ratio ηv to control the minimal number of remaining

We call the height j is reserved if the intra GN block of height j is not replaced by an Identity block.
We prefer to reserve an interval of consecutive heights for the Mee layers. (The inter GN blocks
between these heights remain unchanged while others are replaced as identities) By varying the
heights reserved in each Mee layers, we can create a large number of variants of MeGraph model
including U-Shaped, Bridge-Shaped and Staircase-Shaped."

between the number of layers n and height h is n = 2h + 1, and there is only one GN block in each
layer. We keep the GN block at height j = i for each layer i at the first half layers and keep the GN
block at height j = n −i + 1 for each layer i at the later half layers. In the middle layer, only the last
height j = h = (n −1)/2 has a GN block."

a height of 1 to j (where 1 < j < h)."

Smaller Number of Aggregation Steps for Capturing Long-Range Interactions"

nodes in the original graph while assuming the node representation capacity is large enough."
REFERENCES,0.4649859943977591,"Standard message-passing GNNs require n aggregation steps to capture long-range interactions of n
hops away, therefore requiring a stack of n layers, which could be expensive when n is large."
REFERENCES,0.46638655462184875,"We also assume the height h of the hierarchy is large enough so that all nodes of the original graph
are pooled into a single node. In that case, the information aggregation along the hierarchy captures
all pairs of LRIs into the embedding of the single node. Which means the number of aggregation
steps of MeGraph is h. When we adopt a pooling method that coarsens the graph at least half, h is
at most O(log(|V |)) where |V | is the number of nodes of the input graph. Therefore, the height h is
significantly smaller than the diameter of the graph (which could be O(|V |)) in most cases."

Implementation and Training Details"
REFERENCES,0.48599439775910364,We use PyTorch [45] and Deep Graph Library (DGL) [54] to implement our method.
REFERENCES,0.48739495798319327,"We implement S-EdgePool using DGL, extending from the original implementation of EdgePool in
the Pytorch Geometric library (PYG) [19]. We did Constant optimization over the implementation
to speed up the training and inference of the pooling. We further use Taichi-Lang [29] to speed up
the dynamic node clustering process of S-EdgePool. The practical running time of MeGraph model
with height h > 1 after optimization is about 2h times as the h = 1 baseline. This is still slower
than the theoretical computational complexity due to the constant in the implementation and the
difficulty of paralleling the sequential visitation of edges (according to their scores) in the EdgePool
and S-EdgePool. This process could be further speed up by implementing the operations with the
CUDA library. We provide the practical running time for h > 1 and h = 1 in GNN benchmark and
OGB-G datasets in Tables 7 and 8. The speed is slower than the theoretical one partially due to the
pooling ratio of edges being larger than the nodes, making the number of edges decrease slowly over
the hierarchy. To further speed up, we could use the variants of MeGraph introduced in App. C.5 by
skipping some computation modules."
