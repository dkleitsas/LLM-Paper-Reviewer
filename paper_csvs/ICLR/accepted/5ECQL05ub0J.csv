ABSTRACT,0.002136752136752137,"Most convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with momentum
(SGDm) rely on iid sampling. Yet, SGDm is often used outside this regime, in
settings with temporally correlated input samples such as continual learning and
reinforcement learning. Existing work has shown that SGDm with a decaying step-
size can converge under Markovian temporal correlation. In this work, we show
that SGDm under covariate shift with a fixed step-size can be unstable and diverge.
In particular, we show SGDm under covariate shift is a parametric oscillator,
and so can suffer from a phenomenon known as resonance. We approximate the
learning system as a time varying system of ordinary differential equations, and
leverage existing theory to characterize the system’s divergence/convergence as
resonant/nonresonant modes. The theoretical result is limited to the linear setting
with periodic covariate shift, so we empirically supplement this result to show that
resonance phenomena persist even under non-periodic covariate shift, nonlinear
dynamics with neural networks, and optimizers other than SGDm."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.00641025641025641,"Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Robbins & Monro, 1951) – and its variants such as Adagrad
(Duchi et al., 2011), ADAM (Kingma & Ba, 2014) and RMSprop (Hinton et al., 2012) – are very
widely used optimization algorithms across machine learning. SGD is conceptually straightforward,
easy to implement, and often performs well in practice. Among the variants of SGD, accelerated
versions based on Polyak’s or Nesterov’s acceleration (Polyak, 1964; Nesterov, 1983), known
generally as Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDm), are used widely due to the
improvements in convergence rate they offer. SGDm can give up to a quadratic speedup to SGD
on many functions, and is in fact optimal among all methods having only information about the
gradient at consecutive iterates for convex and Lipschitz continuous optimization problems (Nesterov,
2004; Goh, 2017). SGDm has the same computational complexity as SGD, but exhibits superior
convergence rates under reasonable assumptions (Su et al., 2014)."
INTRODUCTION,0.008547008547008548,"These convergence results for SGDm, however, rely on independent and identically distributed (iid)
sampling. Little is known about the convergence properties of SGDm under non-iid sampling, yet
the non-iid setting is critical. In many machine learning problems it is expensive or impossible to
obtain iid samples. In online learning (Rakhlin et al., 2010) and reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton
& Barto, 2018), the data becomes available in a sequential order and there is a temporal dependence
among the samples. There is a particularly strong temporal dependence in RL, where observed states
are sampled according to the transition dynamics of the underlying Markov decision process (MDP).
Federated learning (Hsieh et al., 2020) and time-series learning (Kuznetsov & Mohri, 2014) provide
further examples of when non-iid sampling is essential to the learning problem."
INTRODUCTION,0.010683760683760684,"Without momentum, SGD’s convergence rate has been examined under non-iid sampling with the
stochastic approximation framework in (Benveniste et al., 2012; Kushner & Yin, 2003), and more
recently under specific assumptions of ergodicity (Duchi et al., 2012) or Markovian sampling (Nagaraj
et al., 2020; Doan et al., 2020b; Sun et al., 2018). Convergence rates under Markovian sampling
are also known for ADAM-type algorithms when applied to policy gradient and temporal difference"

INTRODUCTION,0.014957264957264958,"learning (Xiong et al., 2020). To our knowledge, however, there has been little work on providing
convergence rates or guarantees for SGDm under non-iid sampling. In (Doan et al., 2020a), a progress
bound is provided for SGDm under Markovian sampling based on mixing time—the time required
for a distribution’s convergence toward its stationary distribution—along with a convergence rate
guarantee under decaying step-sizes. In this work, we assume a fixed step-size, since it is a common
choice in the online setting, especially when the practitioner is unsure of mixing rate or stationarity."
INTRODUCTION,0.017094017094017096,"There is a broad literature using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to analyze gradient descent
methods by approximating descent updates as continuous-time flows. Early work is comprehensively
discussed in (Kushner & Yin, 2003; Benveniste et al., 2012). Despite the age and establishment of
the linear setting, the gradient flow lens continues to reveal new insights (e.g. implicit rank reduction
(Arora et al., 2019)) and new perspectives on old insights (e.g. regularization of early stopping (Ali
et al., 2019)). Recent work has paid particular attention to the flow induced by momentum accelerated
methods (Su et al., 2014; Wibisono et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2016; Scieur et al., 2017; Muehlebach &
Jordan, 2021; Diakonikolas & Orecchia, 2019; Muehlebach & Jordan, 2019; Li et al., 2017; Simsekli
et al., 2020; Betancourt et al., 2018; Kovachki & Stuart, 2019; Attouch et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2019;
Siegel, 2019; Zhang et al., 2018; Berthier et al., 2021; Kovachki & Stuart, 2021). In these works, it is
demonstrated that linear regression under iid sampling with SGDm can be represented as an ODE
resembling a harmonic oscillator, sometimes with a time-decaying damping coefficient."
INTRODUCTION,0.019230769230769232,"Contributions: In this work, we show that non-iid sampling, due to covariate shift, induces a related
system: the parametric oscillator, a harmonic oscillator having coefficients which vary over time in
a manner capable of exponentially exciting the system (Mumford, 1960; Csörg˝o & Hatvani, 2010;
Halanay, 1966). We characterize the underlying time-varying ODE, which requires a novel approach
to incorporate covariate shift, and develop specific conditions on covariate shift that lead to divergence
in SGDm. We provide an empirical design, with synthetic data, to systematically test the response of
the learning system to different covariate shift frequencies. We empirically validate that resonance-
driven divergence occurs in a learning system which aligns well with theoretical assumptions. We
follow with similar demonstrations on learning systems which progressively relax further and further
away from our theoretical assumptions, including non-periodic covariate shift, learning with neural
networks and optimizers other than SDGm. The implications of this work are that resonance can
occur in learning systems with momentum, causing instability or poor accuracy, simply due to certain
temporal correlations in the input sequence. Our results provide a novel direction to better understand
the properties of our learning systems for time varying inputs—namely beyond iid sampling—and
point to a gap in the robustness of our algorithms that merits further investigation."

given Theorem 1 and Proposition 2, we have a theoretical guarantee of SGDm’s divergence, but not
its convergence. This is because the divergence rate of θ(t) is exponential, and Proposition 2 provides
a bound on long tail behaviour as θk = θ(√ηk) + O(ηk). Since the approximation error is linear in
time k, and the divergence rate is exponential, the divergence rate dominates, and we are guaranteed
that a diverging θ(t) corresponds to a diverging {θk}. However, the same argument does not imply
that a convergent θ(t) corresponds to a convergent {θk}, because the linear error bound technically

The ODE correspondence for non-iid data in combination with momentum methods is new. The
non-iid data, which induces time variation in ODE dynamics, is subtle to address, because elementary
ODE correspondence (i.e. consistency guarantees) require time invariant ODE dynamics. Our proof
specifically addresses this difficulty using operator splitting theory from recent numerical integration
literature. (2) Once we have this ODE, it is straightforward to recognize that it is a parametric
oscillator. The utility of this connection, however, is that it opens up entirely new avenues for analysis,
since there is deeply established literature on the dynamics of these systems. The primary second
technical novelty, therefore, is to leverage this connection, and use Floquet theory to give precise
divergence conditions for a given η and µ, under periodic covariate shift."

The result in Theorem 1 assumes the expected gradient varies periodically over time given fixed
weights θ. But even with aperiodic and/or stochastic time variation, our LTV system equation 4 might
be similarly susceptible to instability; the theory does not have periodicity as a necessary condition
of divergence. To test this, we replace our periodic covariate shift mean with a mean that moves
according to an AR(2) process. The AR(2) process is tuned to have a frequency peak exactly at
the frequency of the sinusoidal covariate shift of Experiment 4.1, to change only the nature of the
shift—aperiodicity—rather than the frequency."

behaviour in the learning system, which aligns well with the identical predicted stability regions.
Note that both theoretical and empirical results in Figures 2a and 2b suggest that sufficiently low
momentum values µ mitigate the resonance phenomenon, which agrees with the role it plays in the
ODE system: decreasing µ increases damping. We also observe that resonance regions shrink as step
size η is decreased; see the Appendix for plots demonstrating this trend. Analytically characterizing
the bounds of stable µ, η in terms of system properties is an interesting future direction."

However, as we ablate from 5 samples to 1 sample
drawn from each Xk, we move further away from the
expected gradient, towards the fully stochastic gradi-
ent setting. As we can see in Figure 3 resonance is
dampened by stochasticity in the gradient signal, but
nonetheless is still present. These findings are further
supported in Appendix A.3, where Experiments 4.1

though even for smaller variance the distance to θ∗is still on the order of 103. This results makes
sense, as the variance is connected to the driving signal amplitude, on which parametric resonance has
a strong dependence. We also observe a strong dependence on the number of input space dimensions,
in Figure 4b. This aligns with the fact that the expected norm of samples drawn from a multivariate
Gaussian increases with dimensionality, even with a fixed covariance scale (of 0.1). This result
suggests that resonance phenomena may actually be exacerbated for higher-dimensional inputs,

DISCUSSION,0.20085470085470086,"Limitations and Next Steps:
In our theoretical
analysis, we take expectation over observation noise
and over the distribution of inputs Xk, so the gradi-
ent coefficient matrix B(t) in the ODE equation 3 is
deterministic. This allows rigorous characterization
of resonance for periodic B(t). Experiments 4.2 and 4.4 demonstrate that resonance still drives
divergence when B(t) is nondeterministic, so rigorous exploration in future work might employ
stochastic differential equations. In particular, Experiment 4.2 aligns exactly with the theoretical
predictions, suggesting that the resonance is in response to the frequency content of Xt, not its
periodicity."

DISCUSSION,0.20512820512820512,"For the sake of consistency across experiments, our non-iid sampling is always induced by Gaussian
Xk with fixed diagonal covariance matrix. But Assumption 1 is far more relaxed, suggesting
resonance is possible with time-varying covariance and non-Gaussian distributions, which may be
explored in future empirical work"
DISCUSSION,0.20726495726495728,"When assessing a new phenomenon like covariate shift resonance, assessment on simple problems is
a critical first step, and we have endeavored to be comprehensive in that assessment. But we only
scratch the surface of more complex optimizers and nonlinear models. Similarly, for the sake of
experimental control and interpretability, we assess resonance on synthetic data instead of real data.
While it is obvious that many sources of real data have nontrivial frequency content (e.g. audio
samples, machine sensors, etc.) it is not yet clear when realistic frequency content will resonate with
the system trying to learn from it. Optimizers, models, and data all pose exciting future directions for
this work: to extend into the frequency response of more complex optimizers and models, and into
the frequency content of real data."
DISCUSSION,0.2094017094017094,"Finally, the theory in this work is for linear models. This is the correct setting to understand first,
and is of independent interest. Our theory applies to any linear models that are augmented with a
nonlinear basis (such as a Fourier basis, polynomials or radial basis functions) by examining the
frequency content of the basis output signal."
DISCUSSION,0.21153846153846154,"Practical Implications: One potential conclusion from our results is that though resonance could
potentially arise in our learning systems, it may not be problematic. First, the heatmaps in Figures 2a
and 2b indicate that SGDm converges much more often than it diverges, and that we can practically
avoid resonance simply by reducing the momentum parameter µ. As per Appendix A.2, we find that
sufficiently low µ does mitigate resonance. Second, we may simply be able to avoid covariate shift in
the first place, by keeping buffers of data and shuffling samples."
DISCUSSION,0.21367521367521367,"However, the reality is not so simple. Higher levels of momentum are typically more effective in
practice. There is a tension between the level of momentum and avoiding resonance, that cannot
easily be addressed by simply picking low momentum by default. Instead, smarter approaches which
recognize potential resonance and then reduce momentum may be a much more effective way to guard
against this issue; the development of such methods can leverage the insights in this work. In addition,
relying on well-behaved or shuffled inputs may be impractical in certain settings. Algorithms in
signal processing and the streaming literature often process data sequentially. Reinforcement learning
approaches use sliding window buffers (in replay), where covariate shift may still persist across
buffers. Further, it is even possible that adversarial attacks could be designed to exploit this weakness
of SGDm, causing poor performance or even instability from attackers attempting to generate data
that results in resonant behavior."
DISCUSSION,0.21581196581196582,"Our work also suggests avenues towards the development of diagnostic tools. Indeed, our experimental
approach to investigate this phenomena mimics those in the modal analysis literature (Avitabile,
2017). We treat the input sampling process as an input signal which is noisy and/or stochastic,
vary the signal’s frequency content across a wide band, and measure the learning system’s output
as a response across input frequencies. This is analogous to a mechanical engineer triggering an
oscillatory vibration within a machine’s engine compartment, sweeping across frequencies, and
measuring the resulting vibration amplitude in the machine’s housing."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.22008547008547008,"To our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate SGDm under covariate shift from the ODE
perspective. This perspective reveals new insights, in particular the revelation that SGDm under
covariate shift numerically integrates a parametric oscillator, rather than the simple undriven harmonic
oscillator induced by iid sampling. We leverage dynamical systems theory to analyze the stability of a
learning system using SGDm under covariate shift, and are able to provide conditions for exponential
divergence due entirely to the frequency content induced by this non-iid sampling. Despite its age and
establishment, understanding SGDm is an ongoing process. We contribute to this process in a way
that provides physical intuition, rather than a merely algebraic proof. We hope that the connection
we have drawn to parametric oscillation in dynamical systems theory will help to further propel
understanding of non-iid sampling and SGDm."

empirically demonstrate that trend. Specifically, Figure 8 shows the resonance heatmap and spectral
radius contour lines for regression in two weights with covariate shift, identically to Experiments 4.1

(Tables 4-7) for three values of frequency tuning parameter T. The mean signal is essentially white
noise ‘stretched’ according to T. The signal is a single dimension for the figure, but is of higher
dimensions for the actual experiment. The frequency content is a vertical reflection of Figure 12
(right,) with frequency troughs instead of peaks. Note that the frequency content is the mildest of all
settings, having the lowest and least-defined peaks, which aligns with intuition: there is nothing even
remotely oscillatory in its definition. It is reasonable to expect that many ‘natural’ processes would
have more aggressive frequency content."
