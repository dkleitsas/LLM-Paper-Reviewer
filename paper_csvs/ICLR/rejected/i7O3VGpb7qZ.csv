ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.005291005291005291,"This paper considers the computer source code editing with few exemplars. The
editing exemplar, containing the original and modified support code snippets,
showcases a certain editorial pattern, and code editing adapts the common pattern
derived from few support exemplars to a query code snippet. In this work, we
propose a novel deep learning approach to solve this code editing problem auto-
matically. Our learning approach combines edit representations extracted from
support exemplars and compositionally generalizes them to the query code snippet
editing via multi-extent similarities ensemble. Specifically, we parse the support
and query code snippets using language-specific grammar into abstract syntax
trees. We apply the similarities measurement in multiple extents from individual
nodes to collective tree representations for query and support sample matching,
and ensemble the matching results through a similarity-ranking error estimator. We
evaluate the proposed method on C# and Python datasets, and show up to 8.6%
absolute accuracy improvements compared to non-composition baselines."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.015873015873015872,"In recent years, a surge of interest has been witnessed in applying machine learning techniques to
code editing (Zhao et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019; Dinella et al., 2020; Chakraborty et al., 2020;
Yasunaga & Liang, 2020). Code editing in software engineering intends to revise the design, structure,
functionality, or implementation of existing programming codes into a desirable pattern. To maintain
high-quality code projects or merge several repositories, the programmers typically fix one or few
code snippets, and expect the same revision automatically applied to other places in demand over
the whole project. Automating this process can facilitate a broad range of programming applications
such as code migration, refactoring, version update, and bug repair."
INTRODUCTION,0.021164021164021163,"The problem of code editing with exemplar(s) aims to adopt the common editorial pattern from
given exemplar(s) to a query code snippet. The editorial pattern of an exemplar describes the type of
change between two code snippets, and implies the underlying intent of making a kind of edit for a
specific purpose, e.g., updating some keywords or reformatting redundant brackets. Pink rectangles in
Figure 1 provide an example of editorial patterns with the comparisons between previous and edited
code snippets. We also present a list of editorial patterns that appear in our dataset in Appendix A
for reader understanding. This problem is conceptually similar to programming by example in
software engineering (Menon et al., 2013; Meng et al., 2013), and recently has been studied by Yin
et al. (2019); Brody et al. (2020); Yao et al. (2021) in a deep learning fashion. Technically, their
methods parse the source code as an abstract syntax tree using language-specific grammar, apply
one-time or sequential edit actions over the tree, and always keep the modified code snippet satisfying
grammatical rules. In particular, all these works focus on performing code editing with exact one
editing exemplar, i.e., the one-shot setting."
INTRODUCTION,0.026455026455026454,"While the above studies have demonstrated promising results, simply adapting the editorial pat-
tern from one single exemplar can lead to poor generalization or even incorrect code editing.
Figure 1 presents two cases. In Case (a), when a model observes only the Support #1 exem-
plar, it may intuitively interpret the code refactoring rule as replacing the conditional expression
(“if (s==null)...”) by a coalesce one (“...??...;”) only for a newly-declared variable
(“string s=...”). Consequently, applying the model to a query input could mistakenly transform
the newly-declared variable (“string title=...”) rather than its re-assigned correspondence"

INTRODUCTION,0.037037037037037035,"Figure 1: Two illustrative cases of our motivation for code editing learning with few exemplars, rather
than with only one. The purple rectangles on the right part show the incorrect and correct solutions
without or with multiple exemplars composition, respectively, in both Case (a) and (b). The editing
with one exemplar may be dominated by the inductive bias learned from limited samples and thus
lead to an infeasible solution. With few support exemplars, the desirable solution can be reached."
INTRODUCTION,0.042328042328042326,"(“title=ReformatTitle(...)”; see Solution #1). However, Case (b) demonstrates a situation
where two editing exemplars turn to be sufficient for an editing model to capture the logical trans-
formation over code tokens. The foregoing articulates the necessity of leveraging few but not one
exemplar to adapt an editorial pattern to a new code snippet. The few exemplars help the editing
escape from the inductive bias learned from one exemplar, and enhance the generalized capacity for
other snippets with various coding contexts."
INTRODUCTION,0.047619047619047616,"In light of this, in this paper, we consider the computer source code editing with few exemplars. The
editing of a query code snippet is triggered by few editing exemplars that containing the original
and modified support code snippets. Different from the above one-shot code editing scenario, few
exemplars, even within the same editorial pattern, perform divergent coding contexts and edit actions.
Therefore, it is not eligible to adapt the edit actions directly from an arbitrary exemplar. For this
scenario, the major challenge lies in how to identify and match helpful support exemplars for a query
input and compose them to guide the editing."
INTRODUCTION,0.05291005291005291,"To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that combines edit representations extracted
from exemplars and compositionally generalizes them to the query code snippet editing via multi-
extent similarities ensemble. Specifically, we parse the support/query code snippets using language-
specific grammar into abstract syntax trees, where editing actions are executed on nodes. Based on
this, we model the similarity between the representations of the support and query abstract syntax
trees. We notice that among few exemplars, some editing action only happens in a local region, while
concurrently some editing action relies on a general coding context. This inspires us to consider
multi-extent similarities between the representations of the support and query abstract syntax trees.
We design a λ-softmax function by scaling the importance of nodes in an abstract syntax tree, i.e.,
λ →0 means the support/query code snippet is denoted by tree representation, while λ →∞means
the support/query code snippet is denoted by one single node representation in the abstract syntax
tree. By controlling λ the intermediate positions between individual nodes and a collective tree, we
provide multiple intermediate representational query-support matchings, then adaptively ensemble
outcomes from these extents through a similarity-ranking error estimator for a robust composition.
We use the term multi-extent to describe the scope of query-support matching at various levels from
nodes to a collective tree representation."

PRELIMINARY,0.08465608465608465,"Here we introduce one of the state-of-the-arts edit learning models, Graph2Edit (Yao et al., 2021),
that builds the one-shot code editing framework with three major components. (1) A tree encoder
based on Gated Graph Neural Networks (Li et al., 2015) to embed the input abstract syntax tree C−
into node representations Z ∈RN×D, where N is the number of nodes in the tree and D is the latent
feature dimension. The whole tree embedding t can be obtained by a graph pooling operation over all
node representations; (2) An editing encoder to embed input C−and corresponding output C+ into a
vector f∆(C−, C+) ∈RD to represent the entire L sequential editing actions (four types of actions:
add/delete a node, add a subtree, or stop editing) from C−to C+ as well as the procedural editorial
pattern; (3) A decoder for editing action prediction working conditionally on the tree embedding t and
editing representation f∆(C−, C+). Predictions include the operational type, the executive location
on abstract syntax tree, and associated action values, e.g., to be replaced by which node. Denote
t1:l = (t1, . . . , tl) as the tree embedding history along the sequential editing, and a1:l = (a1, . . . , al)
as the editing action history until step l. Formally, the whole predictions of actions can be represented
as a conditional likelihood Pr (a1:L|f∆(C−, C+), t1) = QL
l=1 Pr (al|f∆(C−, C+), t1:l). An earlier
model Graph2Tree (Yin et al., 2019), where Graph2Edit derives from, shares the same methodological
concept but edits the input in one-pass, instead of sequentially predict and apply the edit actions."

encoder and the editing encoder with a pair of C−and C+, and maximizes the likelihood of the whole
predictions of actions towards the shortest sequential actions produced by dynamic programming.
The training details with the dynamic programming algorithm can be found in Yao et al. (2021).
The training only sends the vanilla editing encoder with the ground-truth from one exemplar, while

PRELIMINARY,0.09523809523809523,"Based on the training, Graph2Edit is mainly designed for code editing with only one support exemplar.
It is struggled to directly tackle few supports since few exemplars, even within the same editorial
pattern, perform divergent coding context and edit actions. Unfortunately, we argue the one-exemplar
case lacks the capacity of compositional generalization on editorial patterns as we discussed within the
introductory part. We also empirically evidence this claim in our experimental section. Our method

on individual node representation and regardless of its neighbor nodes and context. For instance,
the removal of a redundant bracket should partially be independent of the inside context, or the
change of some outdated function calling mode in a previous language version should be invariant
to the host object. On the other hand, some editing highly relies on the contextual information"

2019) is a dataset containing 2,878 editing pairs, generated by applying two C# fixing tools Roslyn1
and Roslynator2 on six projects. A fixer is building on top of the C# compiler used to perform
refactoring and modernization on codes. One fixer is designed for one type of refactoring and 16
fixers are selected in this dataset. A pre-trained model for C#Fixer is trained on GitHubEdits dataset
using self-reconstruction. The dataset collects 54 C# projects on GitHub which extract the source
code before and after the commits from users. We use the data of GitHubEdits only for pre-training
and follow the training protocol in Yao et al. (2021) but not for few-shot experiments. (2) Benefiting
from the flexibility and generalized capacity of abstract syntax description language, beyond C#, we
collect another dataset PyFixer written in Python 2. We use Python-Future3, a tool that edits the
codes over 5,959 projects written in Python 2 to satisfy the compatibility of Python 3. We obtain the
code pairs by taking codes before and after applying the tool and inspecting the changes. To simulate
the pre-training and few-shot learning as in GitHubEdits and C#Fixer, we select 12 types of fixers
and extract a fixed number of each fixer from the main data to form the dataset for few-shot learning,
while the rest are preserved for pre-training. After data cleaning, we have 14,941 code pairs for (pre)

calculating the similarity measure ϕθ in Eq. (4). RS (Random Selection): we randomly select one
support exemplar from the support set and use its edit representation for standard decoding on query

distance calculated by graph edit distance (Sanfeliu & Fu, 1983; Abu-Aisheh et al., 2015) over AST
trees (GED-NN), and cosine similarity over input tree representation (CS-NN). AE (Average Edit
Representation): we infer the edit representation of K support exemplars using editing encoder
respectively, and take the mean of these K representations for query decoding. This is equivalent
to setting ϕθ = 1/K in Eq. 4. Moreover, we include two other baselines within our proposed
composition framework. GED-Comp (Composition via graph edit distance) employs the graph
edit distance metric as ϕθ when comparing the query and the support exemplar among every query-

EXPERIMENTAL SETTING,0.37037037037037035,"Protocol
We randomly split fixers for few-shot experiments into meta-train and meta-test sets. For
C#Fixer, the meta-train set contains 12 types of fixers and the meta-test set has the rest 4 fixers.
The meta-train set of PyFixer contains 8 fixers and the meta-test set takes the rest 4. To perform a
comprehensive empirical evaluation, we repeat the random split procedure and obtain 5 different
splits denoted from Split #1 to Split #5. For meta-training, to simulate the low-resource scenario and
mitigate the imbalance on the number of samples per fixer, we take 10 samples for each fixer and
follow a standard episode training strategy. Every time we construct the support set to train on one
query sample, we randomly select the exemplars who are sharing the same fixing type with the query
sample in the sampled data. For meta-testing, we iterate through all samples and each of them as
a query snippet at a time, then randomly sample from the rest of its fixer peer to build its support
set. All numerical results are run with 5 different random seeds. Mean and standard deviation are
reported. Note that the variance not only stems from the training per se, but also is affected by the
random sampling of support set in testing. Since we fix the random seed every time, all methods are
guaranteed to encounter identical query-support combinations in the evaluation under the same seed.
All configurable hyperparameters are tuned on a validation split outside the five evaluative splits.
We defer the model architecture and configurable hyperparameters to supplementary material. The
accuracy per pair is a binary value obtained by whether the model edits C−to meet exact ground-truth
C+. Following Yao et al. (2021), we report both Macro and Micro accuracy since there is a significant
fixer imbalance in C#Fixer. K is set to 5 and λ is set to the ensemble over (1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 10.0) by
default if no specification is noted. We instantiate φθ (in Eq. (1)) as neural networks and ϕθ (in
Eq. (4)) as cosine similarity. Experiments are run on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 graphical card. We

RELATED WORK,0.4444444444444444,"Machine Learning for Code Editing
Code editing using machine learning has been developed for
a long time and is receiving increasing attention in recent years (Menon et al., 2013; Zhang et al.,
2019; Tian et al., 2020). Depending on how a code snippet is represented, the research can be roughly
summarized into two categories, i.e., performing code editing over code token sequences or abstract
syntax tree. In the former category, Yin et al. (2019); Chen et al. (2019); Yasunaga & Liang (2020)
directly generate the expected edited code token sequence, while Shin et al. (2018); Vu & Haffari
(2018); Dong et al. (2019); Zhao et al. (2019) predict the editing operational sequence, which has
been demonstrated to bear more sample efficiency. On the other hand, works in the second category
(Yin et al., 2019; Chakraborty et al., 2020; Tarlow et al., 2020; Dinella et al., 2020; Brody et al.,
2020; Yao et al., 2021) attempt to edit the trees of programs similarly by either directly generating the
edited trees or predicting the tree edit operations. The problem addressed in this paper is conceptually
related to ‘programming by example’ in software engineering that finds the sharing edit operations
among different exemplars and applies it to query snippet (Menon et al., 2013; Osera & Zdancewic,
2015; Ferdowsifard et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2013). Recently, Yin et al. (2019); Yao et al. (2021)
tackle this problem using deep learning techniques. Nonetheless, both of the two works have focused
on code editing from one shot of exemplar, which may not be sufficient for learning generalizable
editing, as we elaborated in Section 1. This inspires us to investigate few-shot code editing."
RELATED WORK,0.4497354497354497,"Few-shot Learning
Few-shot learning has been developed in many low-resource scenes (Vinyals
et al., 2016; Snell et al., 2017; Finn et al., 2017), and with advance in meta seq2seq learning
considering the concept of generalized composition (Gu et al., 2018; Lake, 2019; Nye et al., 2020).
Our work conceptually relates to the matching principle in few-shot learning (Vinyals et al., 2016;
Snell et al., 2017) but with a different compositional task and a specific design for robust multi-
extent abstract syntax tree matching. To our best knowledge, we are the first to consider few-
shot compositional generalization in code editing, which we believe can inspire development in
programming-related applications like code transfer, refactoring, and migration."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.4603174603174603,"In this work, we considered a novel problem in software engineering: code editing with few exemplars.
Based on previous frameworks on code editing using abstract syntax tree to present the computer code
snippets, we proposed an adaptive multi-extent composition method to perform varying intermediate
representations between a collective tree and individual nodes. We leveraged an ensemble approach
to gather the query-support matching from multiple extents and delivered a robust composition over
support editing representations for the query snippet decoding. Evaluations on two code editing
datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our method over baselines by a large margin. To develop
this framework into a product, we consider letting the user collect a few exemplars showing their
own purpose. The tool requests an interaction but also offers full flexibility to the user, and is more
adapted to a personal development environment."

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT"
REFERENCES,0.8518518518518519,"We extend our experiments by considering the ‘Hit-1-in-5’ and ‘Hit-5-in-5’ cases when editing with
one exemplar from the given few exemplars. In the ‘Hit-1-in-5’ case, we separately decode the
query code snippet using the K exemplars and obtain K results. We count the result of the query
sample as correct if any of these K decoding results match with the ground truth. Similarly, in
the ‘Worst’ case, we count it as correct when all of these K results are correct. Note that both the
‘Hit-1-in-5’ and ‘Hit-5-in-5’ cases are not real in practical usage since we only expect one output
from the editing system. Giving possible answers as many as it can is not user-oriented and not
scalable. The ‘Hit-1-in-5’ and ‘Hit-5-in-5’ cases can be understood as the upper and the lower bound
of results if we randomly select one exemplar from the support set but they are almost not achievable.
We include an experiment using every exemplar in Figure 4."
