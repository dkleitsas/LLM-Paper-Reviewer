28"
INTRODUCTION,0.027306967984934087,"the generalized additive model (GAM) framework [10]. A GAM consists of independent functions,
29"
INTRODUCTION,0.02824858757062147,"each corresponding to an input feature, and makes predictions as a linear combination of these
30"
INTRODUCTION,0.02919020715630885,"functions (e.g., the sum of all functions). Therefore, each function reflects the contribution of its
31"

32"
INTRODUCTION,0.031073446327683617,"various fields, such as healthcare [11, 12], survival analysis [13], and model bias discovery [7, 14, 15].
