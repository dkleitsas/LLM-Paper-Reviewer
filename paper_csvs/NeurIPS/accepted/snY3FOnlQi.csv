ABSTRACT,0.007633587786259542,"Can machines recording an audio-visual scene produce realistic, matching audio-
visual experiences at novel positions and novel view directions? We answer it by
studying a new task—real-world audio-visual scene synthesis—and a first-of-its-
kind NeRF-based approach for multimodal learning. Concretely, given a video
recording of an audio-visual scene, the task is to synthesize new videos with spatial
audios along arbitrary novel camera trajectories in that scene. We propose an
acoustic-aware audio generation module that integrates prior knowledge of audio
propagation into NeRF, in which we implicitly associate audio generation with the
3D geometry and material properties of a visual environment. Furthermore, we
present a coordinate transformation module that expresses a view direction relative
to the sound source, enabling the model to learn sound source-centric acoustic
fields. To facilitate the study of this new task, we collect a high-quality Real-World
Audio-Visual Scene (RWAVS) dataset. We demonstrate the advantages of our
method on this real-world dataset and the simulation-based SoundSpaces dataset.

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.015267175572519083,"We study a new task, real-world audio-visual scene synthesis, to generate target videos and audios
along novel camera trajectories from source audio-visual recordings of known trajectories. By
learning from real-world source videos with binaural audio, we aim to generate target video frames
and spatial audios that exhibit consistency with the given camera trajectory visually and acoustically.
This consistency ensures perceptual realism and immersion, enriching the overall user experience."
INTRODUCTION,0.019083969465648856,"As far as we know, attempts in the audio-visual learning literature [1–11] have yet to succeed in
solving this challenging task thus far. Although there are similar works [12–15], these methods have
constraints that limit their ability to solve this new task. Luo et al. [12] propose neural acoustic
fields to model sound propagation in a room. Su et al. [13] introduce representing audio scenes
by disentangling the scene’s geometry features. These methods are tailored for estimating room
impulse response signals in a simulation environment that are difficult to obtain in a real-world scene.
Concurrent to our work, ViGAS proposed by Chen et al. [15] learns to synthesize new sounds by
inferring the audio-visual cues. However, ViGAS is limited to a few viewpoints for audio generation."
INTRODUCTION,0.022900763358778626,"We introduce AV-NeRF, a novel NeRF-based method of synthesizing real-world audio-visual scenes.
AV-NeRF enables the generation of videos and spatial audios, following arbitrary camera trajectories.
It utilizes source videos and camera poses as references. AV-NeRF consists of two branches: A-NeRF,
which learns the acoustic fields of an environment, and V-NeRF, which models color and density
fields. We represent a static audio field as a continuous function using A-NeRF, which takes the
listener’s position and head direction as input. A-NeRF effectively models the energy decay of sound
as the sound travels from the source to the listener by correlating the listener’s position with the"

on sound perception by establishing a correlation between the audio channel difference and the
listener’s direction. Consequently, A-NeRF facilitates distance-sensitive and direction-aware audio
synthesis, resulting in the generation of realistic binaural sound. We utilize the vanilla NeRF [16] as
our V-NeRF for vision rendering since the rendering of the purely visual world has been extensively
researched [17, 16, 18–20] and is not the primary focus of our work."
INTRODUCTION,0.04580152671755725,"To further enhance synthesis quality, we introduce an acoustic-aware audio generation method and a
coordinate transformation mechanism. Considering that the 3D geometry and material properties of
an environment determine sound propagation [21, 22, 4, 23], we propose an acoustic-aware audio
generation module called AV-Mapper. AV-Mapper extracts geometry and material information from
V-NeRF and feed them to A-NeRF, enabling A-NeRF to generate audios with acoustic awareness. In
visual space, NeRF [16] expresses the viewing direction (θ, ϕ) using an absolute coordinate system,
where the directions of two parallel light rays are represented identically. However, in auditory space,
this expression method is unsuitable as it ignores the spatial relationship between the sound emitter
and receiver. Human perception of sound source relies on the relative direction of the sound source
to the head orientation. Given this observation, we propose a coordinate transform mechanism that
expresses the viewing direction relative to the sound source. This approach encourages our model to
learn sound source-centric acoustic fields."
INTRODUCTION,0.04961832061068702,"Our work represents the initial step towards addressing the audio-visual scene synthesis task in
real-world settings. As such, there is currently no publicly available dataset that fulfills our specific
requirements. To facilitate our study, we curated a high-quality audio-visual dataset called RWAVS
(Real-World Audio-Visual Synthesis), which encompasses multimodal data, including camera poses,
video frames, and realistic binaural (stereo) audios. In order to enhance the diversity of our dataset,
we collected data from various environments, ranging from offices and apartments to houses and even
outdoor spaces. We will release this dataset to the research community. Experiments on the RWAVS
and the synthetic SoundSpaces datasets can validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. It
demonstrates AV-NeRF’s capability of synthesizing novel-view audio-visual scenes in a range of
environments, including both real-world and synthetic, as well as indoor and outdoor settings."

RELATED WORK,0.061068702290076333,"Our work is closely related to several areas, including novel-view synthesis, vision-guided audio
spatialization, simulation-based acoustic synthesis, and learning-based audio generation. We elaborate
on each of these topics in the following section."
RELATED WORK,0.0648854961832061,"Neural Fields. Our method is based on neural fields, particularly Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [16].
NeRF employs MLPs to learn an implicit and continuous representation of visual scenes, enabling
the synthesis of novel views. Building upon NeRF’s foundation, several works have extended its
applicability to broader domains, including in-the-wild images [24], (silent) video [25–27], audio"

capture the sound propagation in an environment, and Su et al. [13] introduce disentangling a scene’s
geometry features for audio scene representation (INRAS). Despite the compelling results achieved
by NAF and INRAS, their application in the real world is hindered by their reliance on ground-truth
impulse response signals that are simulated in synthetic environments. Furthermore, the discretization
of position and direction in these approaches restricts the range of camera poses they can handle,
whereas our model can handle continuous position and direction queries. Du et al. [14] proposed a
manifold learning method that maps vectors from a latent space to audio and image spaces. Although
the learned manifold allows for audio-visual interpolation, the model lacks support for controllable
audio-visual generation. In contrast, our method focuses on learning audio-visual representations that
are explicitly conditioned on spatial coordinates, enabling controllable generation."
RELATED WORK,0.07251908396946564,"Visually Informed Spatial Audio Generation. Considering that images often reveal the position of a
sound source and/or the structure of a scene, many visually informed audio spatialization approaches
[7, 28–31, 15] have been proposed. Among them, Gao and Grauman [7] focus on normal field-of-
view videos and binaural audios. Zhou et al. [28] propose a unified framework to solve the sound
separation and stereo sound generation at the same time. Xu et al. [29] propose a Pseudo2Binaural
pipeline that augments audio data using HRIR function [32]. Most recently, Chen et al. [15] proposed
the Visually-Guided Acoustic Synthesis (ViGAS) method for generating novel-view audios. However,
AV-NeRF differs from this method in two ways: (1) ViGAS relies on ground-truth images for audio
transformation, whereas AV-NeRF addresses the absence of ground-truth images by utilizing rendered
images from learned vision fields; (2) ViGAS only supports a limited number of viewpoints for audio
synthesis, while AV-NeRF has the capability to render novel videos at arbitrary camera poses."
RELATED WORK,0.07633587786259542,"Geometry and Material Based Acoustic Simulation. Several works [4, 33, 22, 34, 23] focus on sim-
ulating acoustic environments by modeling their 3D geometry and material properties. SoundSpaces,
proposed by Chen et al. [4], is an audio platform that calculates the room impulse response signals
for discrete listener and sound source positions. Extending this work, Chen et al. [33] introduce
SoundSpaces 2.0, which enables acoustic generation for arbitrary microphone locations. Tang et al.
[23] propose calibrating geometric acoustic ray-tracing with a finite-difference time-domain wave
solver to compute high-quality impulse responses. Additionally, Li et al. [22] propose a method
that blends the early reverberation portion, modeled using geometric acoustic simulation and fre-
quency modulation, with a late reverberation tail extracted from recorded impulse responses. In
contrast to these simulation methods, our approach implicitly leverages learned geometry and material
information for audio-visual scene synthesis."
RELATED WORK,0.08015267175572519,"Learning Based Audio Generation. Learning-based methods exploit the powerful modeling ability
of neural networks to synthesize audios. Tang et al. [34] propose the use of neural networks to estimate
reverberation time (T60) and equalization (EQ). Ratnarajah et al. [35, 36, 37] employ generative
adversarial networks (GANs) to supervise realistic room impulse response generation. Richard et al.
[38] introduce a binauralization network that models the sound propagation linearly and nonlinearly.
Recent research has also investigated learning from noisy data [39] and few-shot data [40]."

A-NERF,0.24045801526717558,"In practice, we simplify the problem of audio synthesis by discarding the z axis and the ϕ direction,
which represents coordinates related to height, and instead focus on the 2D space. On RWAVS and
SoundSpaces datasets, we observe that the sound received by the listener exhibits more distinct
variations along the horizontal plane, as opposed to the vertical axis. Fig. 4 depicts the pipeline of
audio synthesis. Similar to V-NeRF, A-NeRF consists of two MLP components that parameterize
different aspects of acoustic fields. The first MLP takes as input the 2D position (x, y) and frequency
query f ∈[0, F], producing a mixture mask mm for frequency f and a feature vector. The mask mm
quantifies the change in audio magnitude based on the distance between the sound source and the
sound receiver. The feature vector serves as an implicit embedding of the input information and the
acoustic scene. Then we concatenate the feature vector with the transformed direction θ′ (explained
in Sec. 4.4) and pass them to the second MLP. The second MLP associates the direction θ′ with
the channel difference of binaural audios. Given a fixed sound emitter, the difference between two
channels of the received audio changes as the direction θ′ of the sound receiver varies. For instance,
when the receiver faces the emitter, the energy of the two channels will be approximately equal.
Conversely, when the emitter is on the left side of the receiver, the left channel will exhibit higher
energy compared to the right channel. The second MLP is optimized to generate a difference mask

employ the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to calculate the magnitude ss ∈RF ×W , where W
represents the number of time frames and F denotes the number of frequency bins. We then multiply
ss with mask mm to obtain the mixed magnitude sm. Additionally, we multiply sm and mask md to
predict the difference magnitude sd. Then we add mixture magnitude sm and difference magnitude
sd to compute the magnitude of left channel sl, and subtract sd from sm to compute the magnitude
of right channel sr. We further refine sl and sr using 2D convolution. Finally, we apply Inverse
STFT to the predicted sl and sr, respectively, to synthesize the binaural audio at. Because A-NeRF
operates on the magnitude, we use the phase information of the source audio for the Inverse STFT
process. Instead of estimating two channels of the target audio directly, we predict the mixture and
the difference between the two channels of the target audio. Gao and Grauman [7] suggest that direct

Mapper is two-fold: (1) to extract meaningful embeddings while discarding unnecessary features,

practice in visual space such that directions of two parallel light rays are expressed identically.
However, this expression method in audio space is less suitable because the human perception of

direction. To address this limitation, we propose expressing the viewing direction of a camera pose
relative to the sound source. This coordinate transformation encourages A-NeRF learning a sound

V1 represents the direction from the camera to the sound source, and V2 represents the camera’s
direction in the absolute coordinate system. By calculating the angle between V1 and V2, denoted as

DATASETS,0.3931297709923664,"To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first NeRF-based system capable of synthesizing real-
world videos with perceptually realistic binaural audios at arbitrary poses. However, existing datasets
do not meet the specific requirements of our experiments, particularly in terms of simultaneously
providing camera poses, high-quality binaural audios, and images. Therefore, we curated a high-
quality audio-visual scene dataset (real) to address this gap and facilitate further research on this
problem. Additionally, we utilize (synthetic) SoundSpaces dataset [4] to validate our method."
DATASETS,0.3969465648854962,"(1) RWAVS Dataset. We collected the Real-World Audio-Visual Scene (RWAVS) dataset to bench-
mark our method. In order to increase the diversity of our dataset, we recorded data across different
scenarios. Fig. 5 shows the example scenarios we used for data recording, including both indoor and
outdoor environments, which we believe represent most daily settings. RWAVS dataset comprises
multimodal data, including camera poses, high-quality binaural audios, and videos. Unlike Replay-
NVAS dataset [15], where the environment and the recording viewpoint are constant, RWAVS dataset
contains various viewpoints in diverse environments. During data recording, we randomly moved
around the environment while holding the device, capturing various acoustic and visual signals.
RWAVS dataset encompasses all positions and directions (360◦) within an environment."

Therefore, we use the synthetic SoundSpaces dataset to augment our experiments. To evaluate our
method on SoundSpaces dataset, we modify AV-NeRF to estimate impulse responses instead of
the acoustic mask while keeping all other components intact. We follow NAF [12] selecting six
representative indoor scenes, consisting of two single rooms with rectangular walls, two single rooms
with non-rectangular walls, and two multi-room layouts. In each scene, SoundSpaces dataset provides
an extensive collection of impulse response signals for sound source and sound receiver pairs, which
are densely sampled from a 2D room grid. Each pair includes four discrete head orientations (0◦, 90◦,
180◦, and 270◦), and each orientation is associated with two-channel binaural RIRs. We render RGB
and depth images for each sound receiver pose using Habitat-Sim simulator [48, 49]. We maintain

(AV) and coordinate transformation (CT) play important roles in learning audio scenes (Table 2 left).
The exclusion of either component degrades the generation quality; (2) adding visual information to
the input of A-NeRF is the most effective multimodal fusion method compared with concatenation
and adding visual information to all layers of A-NeRF (Table 2 middle); (3) using embeddings to
represent relative angles outperforms applying positional encoding to either absolute or relative

Discussion"
DISCUSSION,0.5,"In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind NeRF system capable of synthesizing real-world audio-
visual scenes. Our model can generate audios with rich spatial information at novel camera poses.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on real RWAVS and synthetic SoundSpaces datasets."
DISCUSSION,0.5038167938931297,"Limitation. Firstly, we currently focus on static scenes with a single fixed sound source in our
study. However, it is worth exploring the challenge of learning implicit neural representations for
audio-visual scenes with multiple dynamic sound sources. Second, while our model successfully
generates audio-visual scenes, it does not account for reverberation effects present in the real world.
Reverberation is essential for humans to perceive scene size and structure. Third, similar to the
original NeRF, AV-NeRF must represent and render each scene separately. Developing a neural field"
DISCUSSION,0.5076335877862596,"that can either learn to represent all scenes or transfer knowledge to new environments is a crucial
problem, particularly for industrial applications."
DISCUSSION,0.5114503816793893,"Broader Impact. Although AV-NeRF is designed to synthesize audio-visual scenes, it is important
to acknowledge its potential application in generating scenes involving artificial humans. The misuse
of AV-NeRF could lead to the production of deceptive and misleading media."
