ABSTRACT,0.0,Abstract
ABSTRACT,0.0017825311942959,"Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used approach for mitigating privacy risks
when training machine learning models on sensitive data. DP mechanisms add
noise during training to limit the risk of information leakage. The scale of the
added noise is critical, as it determines the trade-off between privacy and utility.
The standard practice is to select the noise scale to satisfy a given privacy budget
ε. This privacy budget is in turn interpreted in terms of operational attack risks,
such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of inference attacks aimed to recover
information about the training data records. We show that first calibrating the noise
scale to a privacy budget ε, and then translating ε to attack risk leads to overly
conservative risk assessments and unnecessarily low utility. Instead, we propose
methods to directly calibrate the noise scale to a desired attack risk level, bypassing
the step of choosing ε. For a given notion of attack risk, our approach significantly
decreases noise scale, leading to increased utility at the same level of privacy. We
empirically demonstrate that calibrating noise to attack sensitivity/specificity, rather
than ε, when training privacy-preserving ML models substantially improves model
accuracy for the same risk level. Our work provides a principled and practical way
to improve the utility of privacy-preserving ML without compromising on privacy."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.0053475935828877,"Machine learning and statistical models can leak information about individuals in their training
data, which can be recovered by membership inference, attribute inference, and reconstruction
attacks (Fredrikson et al., 2015; Shokri et al., 2017; Yeom et al., 2018; Balle et al., 2022). The
most common defenses against these attacks are based on differential privacy (DP) (Dwork et al.,
2014). Differential privacy introduces noise to either the data, the training algorithm, or the model
parameters (Chaudhuri et al., 2011). This noise provably limits the adversary’s ability to run successful
attacks at the cost of reducing the utility of the model."
INTRODUCTION,0.0071301247771836,"In DP, the parameters ε and δ control the privacy-utility trade-off. These parameters determine
the scale (e.g., variance) of the noise added during training: Smaller values of these parameters
correspond to larger noise. Larger noise provides stronger privacy guarantees but reduces the utility
of the trained model. Typically, δ is set to a small fixed value (usually between 10−8 and 10−5),
leaving ε as the primary tunable parameter. Without additional analyses, the values of parameters
(ε, δ) alone do not provide a tangible and intuitive operational notion of privacy risk (Nanayakkara
et al., 2023). This begs the question: how should practitioners, regulators, and data subjects decide
on acceptable values of ε and δ and calibrate the noise scale to achieve a desired level of protection?"

INTRODUCTION,0.0481283422459893,"A standard way of assigning operational meaning to DP parameters is mapping them to attack
risks. One common approach is computing attacker’s posterior belief (or equivalently, accuracy or
advantage) of membership inference attacks, that concrete values of (ε, δ) allow (Wood et al., 2018).
An alternative is to compute the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity of feasible membership
inference attacks (Wasserman and Zhou, 2010; Kairouz et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2022), which was
recently shown to also be directly related to success of record reconstruction attacks (Hayes et al.,
2024; Kaissis et al., 2023a). Such approaches map (ε, δ) to a quantifiable level of risk for individuals
whose data is present in the dataset. Studies have shown that such risk-based measures are the most
useful way to interpret the guarantees afforded by DP for practitioners and data subjects (Cummings
et al., 2021; Franzen et al., 2022; Nanayakkara et al., 2023)."
INTRODUCTION,0.049910873440285206,"In this work, we show that directly calibrating the level of noise to satisfy a given level of attack
risk, as opposed to satisfying a certain ε, enables a significant increase in utility (see Figure 1). We
enable this direct calibration to attack risk by working under f-DP (Dong et al., 2022), a hypothesis
testing interpretation of DP. In particular, we extend the tight privacy analysis method by Doroshenko
et al. (2022) to directly estimate operational privacy risk notions in f-DP. Then, we use our extended
algorithm to directly calibrate the level of noise to satisfy a given level of attack risk. Concretely, our
contributions are:"
INTRODUCTION,0.05169340463458111,"1. We provide efficient methods for calibrating noise to (a) maximum accuracy (equivalently,
advantage), (b) sensitivity and specificity of membership inference attacks, in any DP
mechanism, including DP-SGD (Abadi et al., 2016) with arbitrarily many steps.
2. We empirically show that our calibration methods reduce the required noise scale for a given
level of privacy risk, up to 2× as compared to standard methods for choosing DP parameters.
In a private language modeling task with GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), we demonstrate that
the decrease in noise can translate to a 18 p.p. gain in classification accuracy.
3. We demonstrate that relying on membership inference accuracy as an interpretation of
privacy risk, as is common practice, can increase attack power in privacy-critical regimes,
and that calibration for sensitivity and specificity does not suffer from this drawback."

Our Objective: Attack-Aware Noise Calibration"
OPERATIONAL PRIVACY RISKS,0.12477718360071301,"The standard practice in DP is to calibrate the noise scale ω of a mechanism Mω(·) to some target
(ε⋆, δ⋆)-DP guarantee, with ε⋆from a recommended range, e.g., ε⋆∈[2, 10], and δ⋆fixed to
δ⋆< 1/n, as in Eq. (2). Then, the privacy guarantees provided by the chosen (ε⋆, δ⋆) are obtained
by mapping these values to bounds on sensitivity and specificity (by Proposition 2.1) or advantage
(by Proposition 2.2) of membership inference attacks. In this work, we show that if the goal is
to provide an operational and interpretable guarantee such as attack advantage or FPR/FNR, this
approach leads to unnecessarily pessimistic noise requirements and a deterioration in utility due to
the intermediate step of setting (ε⋆, δ⋆). We show it is possible to skip this intermediate step by using
the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP to directly calibrate noise to operational notions of privacy
risk. In practice, this means replacing the constraint in Eq. (2) with an operational notion of risk:"

binary search (see, e.g., Paszke et al., 2019) using calls to the riskω function to an arbitrary precision.
Second, we need a way to compute riskω for any value ω. In the next section, we provide efficient
methods for doing so for general DP mechanisms, including composed mechanisms such as DP-SGD,

OTHER APPROACHES TO TRADE-OFF CURVE ACCOUNTING,0.22638146167557932,"Benefits of PLRV-based Trade-Off Curve Accounting. Computational efficiency is important
when estimating fω(α), as the calibration problem requires evaluating this function multiple times for
different values of ω as part of binary search. Algorithm 1 computes fω(α) for a single ω in ≈500ms,
enabling fast calibration, e.g., in ≈1 minute for DP-SGD with T = 10,000 steps on commodity
hardware (see Appendix H). Existing methods for estimating fω(α), on the contrary, either provide
weaker guarantees than Proposition 3.5 or are substantially less efficient. In particular, Dong et al.
(2022) introduced µ-GDP, an asymptotic expression for fω(α) as T →∞, that overestimates
privacy (Gopi et al., 2021), and thus leads to mechanisms that do not satisfy the desired level of attack
resilience when calibrating to it. Nasr et al. (2023); Zheng et al. (2020) introduced a discretization-
based approach to approximate fω(α) (discussed next) that can be orders of magnitude less efficient
than the direct estimation in Algorithm 1, e.g., 1–6 minutes (≈100–700× slower) for a single
evaluation of fω(α) in the same setting as before, depending on the coarseness of discretization."
OTHER APPROACHES TO TRADE-OFF CURVE ACCOUNTING,0.2281639928698752,"Calibration using Black-Box Accountants. Most DP mechanisms are accompanied by (ε, δ)-DP
accountants, i.e., methods to compute their privacy profile εω(δ) or δω(ε). Black-box access to these

mechanisms bound advantage as η ≤δ. Thus, advantage calibration can also be performed with
any εω(δ) accountant by calibrating noise to ensure εω(η⋆) = 0. Estimating fω(α), as mentioned
previously, is less straightforward. Existing numeric approaches (Nasr et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2020)
are equivalent to approximating Eq. (6) on a discrete grid over δ ∈{δ1, . . . , δu}. This requires u
calls to the accountant εω(δ), thus quickly becomes inefficient for estimating fω(α) to high precision.

Concluding Remarks"
CONCLUDING REMARKS,0.2816399286987522,"In this work, we proposed novel methods for calibrating noise in differentially private learning
targeting a given level of operational privacy risk: advantage and FPR/FNR of membership infer-
ence attacks. We introduced an accounting algorithm which directly and tightly estimates privacy
guarantees in terms of f-DP, which characterizes these operational risks. Using simulations and
end-to-end experiments on common use cases, we showed that our attack-aware noise calibration
significantly decreases the required level of noise compared to the standard approach at the same level
of operational risk. In the case of calibration for advantage, we also showed that the noise decrease
could be harmful as it could allow for increased attack success in the low FPR regime compared to
the standard approach, whereas calibration for a given level of FPR/FNR mitigates this issue. Next,
we discuss limitations and possible directions for future work."
CONCLUDING REMARKS,0.28342245989304815,"Choice of Target FPR/FNR. We leave open the question on how to choose the target FPR α⋆and
FNR β⋆, e.g., whether standard significance levels in sciences such as α⋆= 0.05 are compatible with
data protection regulation and norms. Further work is needed to develop concrete guidance on the
choice of target FPR and FNR informed by legal and practical constraints."
CONCLUDING REMARKS,0.28520499108734404,"Catastrophic Failures.
It is possible to construct pathological DP mechanisms which admit
catastrophic failures (see, e.g., Ponomareva et al., 2023), i.e., mechanisms which allow non-trivial
attack TPR at FPR α = 0 so that their trade-off curve is such that T(M(S), M(S′))(0) < 1 for some
S ≃S′. A classical example in the context of private data release is a mechanism that releases a
data record in the clear with probability δ > 0, in which case we have T(M(S), M(S′))(0) = 1 −δ.
See the proof of Proposition 3.3 in Appendix E for a concrete construction. In the case that such
a pathological mechanism is used in practice, one should use standard calibration to (ε, δ) with
δ ≪1/n to directly limit the chance of catastrophic failures. Fortunately, practical mechanisms such
as DP-SGD do not admit catastrophic failures, as they ensure T(M(S), M(S′))(0) = 1."
CONCLUDING REMARKS,0.28698752228163993,"Tight Bounds for Privacy Auditing. Multiple prior works on auditing the privacy properties of ML
algorithms (Nasr et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Jayaraman and Evans, 2019; Erlingsson et al., 2019)
used conversions between (ε, δ) and operational risks like in Proposition 2.1, which we have shown
to significantly overestimate the actual risks. Beyond calibrating noise, our methods provide bounds
on attack success rates for audits in a more precise and computationally efficient way than a recent
similar approach by Nasr et al. (2023)."
CONCLUDING REMARKS,0.2887700534759358,"Accounting in the Relaxed Threat Models. Although we have focused on DP, our methods apply
to any notion of privacy that is also formalized as a hypothesis test. In particular, our method can be
used as is to compute privacy guarantees of DP-SGD in a relaxed threat model (RTM) proposed by
Kaissis et al. (2023b). Previously, there was no efficient method for accounting in the RTM."
CONCLUDING REMARKS,0.2905525846702317,"Applications Beyond Privacy.
Our method can be applied to ensure provable generalization
guarantees in deep learning. Indeed, prior work has shown that advantage η bounds generalization
gaps of ML models (Kulynych et al., 2022a,b). Thus, even though advantage calibration can
exacerbate certain risks, it can be a useful tool for ensuring a desired level of generalization in models
that usually do not come with non-vacuous generalization guarantees, e.g., deep neural networks."

δi(ε). Given an input discretization parameter ∆, a size k, and a starting ε1, (Doroshenko et al.,

Some Properties of the Trade-Off Curves of Discrete Dominating Pairs"

particular, these observations hold for the trade-off curve described Theorem 3.3."
REFERENCES,0.5401069518716578,"Connecting the Dots.
From the proof of Theorem 3.3 (see Appendix E.2), we know that when
the level α happens to equal a point in the reverse CDF of X, i.e. when α = Pr[X > xi] for some
i, that the corresponding FNR T(P, Q)(α) is simply the CDF of Y evaluated at the same point, i.e.
T(P, Q)(α) = Pr[Y ≤xi]. Since the reverse CDF of X can take on k + 1 values, it follows that
there are k + 1 values of α where the trade-off curve is fully characterized by the CDF of the PLRVs."
REFERENCES,0.5418894830659536,"Next, we observe a special structure of the trade-off curve on the points outside of these k + 1 values.
For fixed τ, Eq. (34) implies α∗(τ, γ) is increasing linearly in γ and Eq. (37) implies β∗(τ, γ) is
decreasing linearly in γ. This implies that the trade-off curve “in between” the k + 1 points that
correspond to the CDFs of the PLRVs is a linear interpolation, where one “connects the dots”. Hence,
the trade-off curve is piece-wise linear, continuous everywhere, and not differentiable at the k + 1
points where α happens to be on the reverse CDF of X."
REFERENCES,0.5436720142602496,"This observation provides an interesting connection to Doroshenko et al. (2022), who showed that
“connecting the dots” between finite points on the privacy profile δ(eε)|| yields a valid pessimistic
estimate to the privacy profile. Could “connecting the dots” in trade-off curve space also yield a valid
pessimistic estimate? The answer is clearly no: “connecting the dots” on finite samples from a trade-
off curve corresponds to an optimistic bound on the trade-off curve. Nevertheless, it is interesting to
note that the class of discrete and finitely supported privacy loss random variables simultaneously
achieve a pessimistic bound in privacy profile space and an optimistic bound in trade-off curve space.
Further exploration of this phenomena, specifically in the context of constructing optimal optimistic
privacy estimates, is left as future work."

The trade-off curve of discrete dominating (P, Q) in general does not

case T(P, Q)(0) = Pr[Y ≤xmax] = 1 −Pr[Y > xmax]. Whether or not this equals 1 depends on the
details of the PLRV Y , though we note that in our experiments, T(P, Q)(0) is usually 1 to within a
margin of 10−10. Moreover, we have that T(P, Q)(α) = 0 for any α ∈[Pr[X > −∞], 1]. Indeed,

function T(P, Q)−1. The only obstacle remaining is in determining ¯x = inf{x ∈[0, 1] | : −1 ∈

CLAIMS,0.8841354723707665,1. Claims
CLAIMS,0.8859180035650623,"Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Claims in the abstract/intro succinctly represent the claims in the main body.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8877005347593583,"• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.8894830659536542,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section 3.1 discusses in detail the limitations of advantage calibration. Sec-
tion 5 discusses limitations and future work for the whole paper.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8912655971479501,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate “Limitations” section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs"
CLAIMS,0.893048128342246,"Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]"
CLAIMS,0.8948306595365418,"Justification: The theoretical results are within the standard setup of differential privacy
detailed in Section 2.1."

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.9073083778966132,Guidelines:
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.9090909090909091,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results."

OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9126559714795008,"Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We use common openly available benchmark datasets. We have published the
code on the Github platform.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9144385026737968,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9162210338680927,"Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the information on the machine learning details in the main body
as well as in Appendix H.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9180035650623886,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9197860962566845,"Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: In our setting, we can directly approximate the theoretical quantities of
interest (i.e., the level of privacy) without the need for empirical statistical methods and the
corresponding uncertainty estimation. For the empirically evaluated model accuracy values,
we only use one seed in the main suite of experiments for computational reasons. In the
additional experiments in Appendix H, we provide 95% confidence bands.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9215686274509803,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer “Yes” if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper."
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9233511586452763,"• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text."

BROADER IMPACTS,0.9518716577540107,"Justification: The topic of our paper is concerned with a social issue of privacy in machine
learning and statistical analyses, and our work aims to improve the state of the art in the
area. Although our work is mostly technical, we take a broader look in Sections 1 and 5."
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9536541889483066,Guidelines:
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9554367201426025,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards"
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9572192513368984,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:"
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9590017825311943,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
