ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.002570694087403599,"Instance-dependent label noise (IDN) widely exists in real-world datasets and usu-
ally misleads the training of deep neural networks. Noise transition matrix (NTM)
(i.e., the probability that clean labels flip into noisy labels) is used to characterize
the label noise and can be adopted to bridge the gap between clean and noisy un-
derlying data distributions. However, most instances are long-tail, i.e., the number
of occurrences of each instance is usually limited, which leads to the gap between
the underlying distribution and the empirical distribution. Therefore, the genuine
problem caused by IDN is empirical, instead of underlying, data distribution
mismatch during training. To directly tackle the empirical distribution mismatch
problem, we propose posterior transition matrix (PTM) to posteriorly model label
noise given limited observed noisy labels, which achieves statistically consistent
classifiers. Note that even if an instance is corrupted by the same NTM, the intrinsic
randomness incurs different noisy labels, and thus requires different correction
methods. Motivated by this observation, we propose an Information Fusion (IF)
approach to fine-tune the NTM based on the estimated PTM. Specifically, we adopt
the noisy labels and model predicted probabilities to estimate the PTM and then
correct the NTM in forward propagation. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art
approaches, and achieves more stable training for instance-dependent label noise."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.007712082262210797,"Data labels annotated from human efforts, such as crowdsourcing (Yan et al., 2014; Chen et al.,
2017) and online queries (Divvala et al., 2014), may be heavily noisy in practice (Wei et al., 2022).
To make it worse, the label noise stemmed from human annotations is often instance-dependent.
For example, the images close to the decision boundary are usually prone to be mislabeled (Zhang
et al., 2021b; Zhu et al., 2021b). On the other hand, the remarkable success of deep neural networks
(DNNs) on supervised learning tasks heavily relies on the expressive power and a large number of
data with accurate labels. Unfortunately, deep neural networks memorizes noisy labels leading to
poor generalization (Zhang et al., 2017). It is challenging to learn with practical instance-dependent
label noise (IDN) due to the hidden and complicated label noise properties (Liu, 2021; Zhu et al.,
2022b; Cheng et al., 2021b; Zhu et al., 2022a)."
INTRODUCTION,0.010282776349614395,"The methods dealing with noisy labels fall into two lines, including heuristically identifying noisy
samples and statistical label noise modeling. The training of deep neural networks often learns clean
labels first (Arpit et al., 2017) and then gradually memorizes noisy labels, which is recognized as
the memorization effect. Based on the general memorization effect, the heuristic methods are all
designed by following the anomaly detection strategy: identify noisy samples based on different
behaviors (e.g., loss values) between clean and noisy samples during training Cheng et al. (2021a).
The typical methods contain sample selection (Yu et al., 2019; Han et al., 2018b), reweight samples
(Cheng et al., 2021a; Jiang et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2018), label correction (Ma et al., 2018; Tanaka
et al., 2018), and regularization (Han et al., 2018a). Although these algorithms empirically work well,
the reliability cannot be guaranteed explicitly without modeling label noise."
INTRODUCTION,0.012853470437017995,"Another line of works relies on noise transition matrix (NTM) to model label noise statistically (Xia

INTRODUCTION,0.02056555269922879,"labels. Although the NTM-based methods possess theoretical guarantee, NTM estimation for each
instance under IDN is pretty challenging. To ease the estimation, some unrealistic assumptions have
been made on NTM, including instance-independent transition matrix (Liu & Guo, 2020; Wei & Liu,
2021; Li et al., 2021), symmetric transition matrix (Menon et al., 2018), upper bounded noise rate
(Cheng et al., 2020), and part-dependent label noise (Xia et al., 2020). However, under the complex
IDN, the empirical noise distribution could be highly different from the underlying noise distribution.
For example, in Figure 1, the underlying and empirical noisy distributions for long-tail instances
are different since the empirical noisy label can be either the same as or different from the clean
label. Additionally, observed noisy labels provide inductive bias toward label corruption. In other
words, the genuine problem arising from IDN is the empirical, instead of underlying, clean and noisy
distribution mismatch problem."
INTRODUCTION,0.02313624678663239,"To mitigate the empirical distribution mismatch problem, we propose the posterior transition matrix
(PTM) to model label noise given the observed noisy labels. We adopt PTM to provably bridge the
gap between clean and noisy underlying data distributions, and empirical distribution of all anchor
points (i.e., data points that belong to a specific class almost surely (Xia et al., 2020)) simultaneously.
We also provide an easy-to-compute PTM estimation method under the low label noise condition.
To further extend the applicability, motivated by Kalman filtering (Kalman, 1960), we propose the
information fusion (IF) method to linearly combine the estimated NTM and PTM, which achieves
lower transition matrix estimation error. We empirically show that the proposed IF method can achieve
higher accuracy and more stable training. The main contributions of this work are summarized below."
INTRODUCTION,0.02570694087403599,"• We propose a new concept of PTM to achieve statistically consistent classifiers for underlying
distribution mismatch and anchor point empirical distribution mismatch simultaneously.
• We propose a simple yet effective PTM estimation method based on observed noisy labels under

Let function f(·) represent a neural network and f(x) denote the c-

noise may mislead a deep learning model. The existing NTM-based methods first estimate NTM

(Patrini et al., 2017), the estimated NTM is adopted to corrupt the predicted probability f(x), i.e., the
corrupted predicted probability is ˜f(x) = T(x)⊤f(x), and then the corrupted predicted probability
is enforced to approximate the noisy label ˜y. Suppose T(x) is non-singular and the loss function
is proper and composite. The forward loss correction can achieve a consistent classifier, i.e., the

a neural network is prone to overfit noisy data. To achieve this condition, the warm-up training
strategy and iterative PTM estimation are adopted. Warm-up training can make “good” neural
network outputs approximating the empirical clean distribution since the network fits clean samples

the condition that a neural network approximates clean labels could still be strong even after the
warm-up strategy and iterative estimation are adopted, and PTM estimation error could be large for
large IDN rates. To further reduce the estimation error, motivated by Kalman filtering, we propose the
information fusion (IF) approach to obtain more accurate transition matrix estimation via weighted
average of PTM estimation and NTM estimation with both intuitive and theoretical justifications1.
Intuitively, for each instance, the estimated NTM and PTM may have different estimation accuracy,
and, therefore, it is possible to obtain a more accurate transition matrix estimation by adaptively and
linearly combine these two matrices. Specifically, we first quantify the estimation uncertainty and
assign higher weight for the estimation with lower uncertainty. In this way, a more accurate estimated
transition matrix can be generated."

matrices to correct the loss function. Experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets show
that IF can achieve higher accuracy and more stable training compared with state-of-the-art methods,
especially for high noise rates. In the future, we can extend to incorporate more prior knowledge of
the transition matrix, e.g., sparsity or low rank, into the end-to-end learning algorithm."

LEARNING NOISE TRANSITION MATRIX VIA DECOMPOSITION"
END,0.8226221079691517,"For the instance-dependent label noise, the NTM may be different for different samples. Thus,
the complexity of NTM estimation is O(Nc2), which leads to ill-posed estimation problem. (Xia
et al., 2020) introduces a part-dependent decomposition on the NTM, i.e., the noise of an instance
depends only on its parts. Specifically, given L part-dependent transition matrix, e.g, P l ∈[0, 1]c×c,
where j = 1, · · · , L, the instance-dependent matrix can be approximated by a combination of part-
dependent transition matrix and the combination coefficients, defined as h(x) ∈[0, 1]L, depend on
the feature vectors. Then the instance-dependent transition matrix W(x) can be approximated as
follows"

error for instance-dependent transition matrix."
END,0.8406169665809768,"(Xia et al., 2020) justifies the part-dependent decomposition assumption via parts-based represen-
tations. For example, (Hosseini-Asl et al., 2016) shows that the input features rely on parts-based
representations in object recognition. Thus, it is natural to approximate the label noise in the part
level. In display advertising, the delay feedback of the label (Ktena et al., 2019; Yasui et al., 2020)
introduces label noise. Earlier the data is generated, the less probability the feedback exists. Thus,
the label noise highly depends on part of features."
END,0.8431876606683805,"Since the instance-dependent NTM may be poorly learned, the slack variable trick (Xia et al., 2019;
2020) is also adopted to modify the instance-dependent transition matrix, which significantly improve
the accuracy. However, the slack variable trick ignores the posterior information for each instance,
which limits the accuracy. In addition, the variance of accuracy in (Xia et al., 2020) is large since
there is not any guide information to modify the instance-dependent NTM except minimization of the
corrected loss. In this paper, we claim that the measurement information is useful to modify the NTM.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS"
END,0.8483290488431876,"Warm-up Training Strategy
Aiming to estimate the transition matrix, we adopt warm-up training
strategy that training the neural network via cross entropy loss with noisy data. we use SGD as the
optimizer with 0.9 momentum, 128 batch size, and 10 epochs. With the benefit of memorization
effect (Arpit et al., 2017), warm-up training with appropriate epochs can guarantee that the predicted
probability of neural network is reliable and can approximate underlying clean probability."
END,0.8508997429305912,"Training with Corrected Loss
Our proposed PTM estimation relies on the neural network predicted
probability. Although the warm-up training can guarantee the prediction accuracy for clean instances
with the benefits of memorization effect, the prediction of the PTM estimation may still be not reliable.
To ease the dilemma, we adopt sample selection to choose the reliable prediction and thus guarantee
the reliable PTM estimation for specific instance. Similar to (Cheng et al., 2021a), the small-loss
criteria is adopted to select the instances with small training loss for training. Specifically, we select
the instance via the weighted loss if the instance loss is less than the average loss over all classes."
END,0.8534704370179949,"For the instance satisfying the small loss criterion, we have confidence that the instance is clean,
which means the PTM is identity. To put it simply, we sum the estimated PTM and identity and
then adopt column normalization. It is worth noting that the noisy labels are adopted in forward
propagation, which is highly different with previous transition matrix-based works (Xia et al., 2019;
Liu & Tao, 2015; Patrini et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2020). Compared with hard sample selection based
methods (Cheng et al., 2021a), our method achieves the soft sample selection and adaptively correct
the loss for “clean"" instance."

STABILITY ON SYNTHETIC NOISY DATASETS"
END,0.8611825192802056,"We study the training stability via inspecting the test accuracy over epochs. Figures 6 and 7 show
the test accuracy with respect to epochs on SVHN and F-MNIST datasets with noise rate IDN-10%
to IDN-40%. It is seen that our proposed method IF can achieve better accuracy and stable training
compare with baseline PTD, which implies that the PTM fusion can decrease the transition matrix
estimation error and improve the training stability. T-Revision trick (-V method) proposed in (Xia
et al., 2019) aims to compensate the NTM and thus improve the accuracy performance. It is seen that
PTD-F-V can achieve better performance than PTD-F, which verifies that the learned NTM is not
very accurate. For our proposed method, IF-V can achieve comparable performance than IF-F and
demonstrates that transition matrix revision trick can not improve the performance since PTM has
already been employed to compensate the transition matrix error."

There are three types of label noise model, including the random classification
noise (RCN) model (Manwani & Sastry, 2013; Natarajan et al., 2013), the class-conditional label
noise (CCN) model (Patrini et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2019; Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018; Liu & Guo,
2020) and the e instance-dependent label noise (IDN) model (Cheng et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020;
Cheng et al., 2021a; Berthon et al., 2021; ?). Specifically, RCN means that each label is flipped
independently with a constant probability, CCN assumes that the flip probability (noise rates) are
the same for the instance with the same clean labels. IDN is the most general case, where the flip
probability depends on its instance."

anchor points assumption (Xia et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2020). Subsequently, the
estimated transition matrix can be adopted to correct the loss function via forward correction (Patrini
et al., 2017), backward correction (Patrini et al., 2017) and reweight (Xia et al., 2019; Liu & Tao,
2015)."
END,0.9974293059125964,"Loss Correction via Sample Selection
Due to the experiments observation– the neural network
learns clean instances first (Arpit et al., 2017) and memorizes the instances gradually, there are lots
of methods attempting to identify mislabeled training examples and then filter them out (Brodley &
Friedl, 1999; Jiang et al., 2018; Han et al., 2018b; Yu et al., 2019; Angelova et al., 2005; Huang et al.,
2019; Li et al., 2019). The core idea is to select the “small loss"" samples as clean one."
