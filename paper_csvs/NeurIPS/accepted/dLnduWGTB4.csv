ABSTRACT,0.0029585798816568047,"An important challenge in machine translation is to generate high-quality and
diverse translations. Prior work has shown that the estimated likelihood from the
MT model correlates poorly with translation quality. In contrast, quality evaluation
metrics (such as COMET or BLEURT) exhibit high correlations with human
judgments, which has motivated their use as rerankers (such as quality-aware and
minimum Bayes risk decoding). However, relying on a single translation with high
estimated quality increases the chances of “gaming the metric”. In this paper, we
address the problem of sampling a set of high-quality and diverse translations. We
provide a simple and effective way to avoid over-reliance on noisy quality estimates
by using them as the energy function of a Gibbs distribution. Instead of looking for
a mode in the distribution, we generate multiple samples from high-density areas
through the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a simple Markov chain Monte Carlo
approach. The results show that our proposed method leads to high-quality and
diverse outputs across multiple language pairs (ENGLISH↔{GERMAN, RUSSIAN})
with two strong decoder-only LLMs (ALMA-7B, TOWER-7B)."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.008875739644970414,"Machine translation (MT) is becoming increasingly more accurate and powerful, as it benefits from
the many capabilities and acquired knowledge of large language models (LLMs) (Freitag et al.,
2023b; Hendy et al., 2023). However, for many domains and languages the quality of translation is
still not satisfactory—for example, hallucinations or critical errors are a serious issue when translating
high-risk content, as in medical and legal domains (Khoong et al., 2019; Taira et al., 2021; Shen
et al., 2023; Guerreiro et al., 2023b; Sanz-Valdivieso and López-Arroyo, 2023; Grimm et al., 2024).
Developing procedures for sampling higher-quality translations is therefore in high demand."
INTRODUCTION,0.011834319526627219,"It is known that the output quality of the translations generated by maximizing the model likelihood
is limited because of the inadequacy of the mode—models tend to produce distributions over outputs
that are highly peaked, favoring a single hypothesis (Eikema and Aziz, 2020; Peters and Martins,
2021; Eikema, 2024); and improving search often makes things worse (Koehn and Knowles, 2017;
Stahlberg and Byrne, 2019). In general, maximizing model likelihood tends to overlook hypotheses
that could be equally valid and more appropriate in certain contexts. To address this limitation, a
string of work has been initiated towards “quality-aware decoding”, which leverages powerful quality
estimation (QE) and evaluation metrics, such as COMET (Rei et al., 2022) or BLEURT (Yan et al.,
2023), to explore and rerank a broader range of candidate hypotheses generated via sampling from
the model’s distribution, selecting the best-1 (Freitag et al., 2022a; Fernandes et al., 2022b; Farinhas
et al., 2023) or the best-k (Jinnai et al., 2024; Singhal et al., 2023) according to these learned metrics."

INTRODUCTION,0.01775147928994083,"Figure 1: QUEST samples an index from the current translation (yt), removes all elements to the
right of the index, generates a new continuation, and then uses the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion to decide whether to accept or reject the resulting new translation. The process continues for
a fixed number of T iterations."
INTRODUCTION,0.020710059171597635,"Despite the benefits, reranking-based methods have their own drawbacks. There is a risk of these
approaches overfitting to the metrics used, potentially leading to illusory gains in quality, as the
translations obtained via optimizing these metrics may not always be preferred by humans when
compared to other alternatives (Fernandes et al., 2022b). Secondly, their effectiveness is limited by
the quality of the initial candidate set. For instance, Vernikos and Popescu-Belis (2024) show that
many high-quality translations, generated by combining translation hypotheses, are less likely to be
sampled from the model’s distribution even with a very large pool size."
INTRODUCTION,0.023668639053254437,"One potential way to remedy these issues, which we explore in this paper, is to use these automatic
metric proxies as the energy function of a Gibbs distribution. However, sampling hypotheses
from this distribution presents a difficult challenge: unlike likelihood-based sampling, “quality-based
sampling” from a Gibbs distribution cannot be performed autoregressively, and it is intractable to
enumerate and score all possible hypotheses. We address this challenge by proposing a simple
and effective Markov chain Monte Carlo approach (MCMC) method, combining the Metropolis-
Hastings algorithm with a suitable proposal distribution. Our method, Quality-Aware Metropolis-
Hastings (QUEST) Sampling, uses a novel proposal distribution that is compatible with sentence-
level evaluation metrics, common in text generation tasks like MT (Figure 1). We further note that
while we focus on MT, where automatic QE metrics are more developed and robust, our proposed
method is general and can be applied to other natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Furthermore,
as our method is agnostic to the specific quality metric used in the Gibbs distribution, it can directly
benefit from any future improvements in the metrics."
INTRODUCTION,0.026627218934911243,"We show that QUEST sampling results in high-quality and diverse samples on multiple test beds
(WMT23 ENGLISH ↔{GERMAN, RUSSIAN}) and with multiple decoder-only LLMs (TOWER-7B,
ALMA-7B). Our method generates many novel hypotheses from the high-density regions unlikely
to be generated via ancestral sampling. Furthermore, with increasing chain size, average quality as
measured by automatic metrics continues to improve, unlike ancestral sampling, where the candidate
set quality remains unchanged even with a larger pool size.2"

2022a; Eikema, 2024). Instead of solely relying on the likelihood, these works advocate using an
automatic translation quality metric as a utility function for minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding or
reranking based on QE metrics. This shift not only improves the selection of translations but also
facilitates the exploration of the underlying distribution learned by the models. However, it is crucial
to acknowledge that the overall translation quality is still contingent on the quality of the candidate
pool. We next discuss common automatic metrics used for assessing translation quality."

Automatic Metrics for Machine Translation"
AUTOMATIC METRICS FOR MACHINE TRANSLATION,0.06804733727810651,"Automatic quality assessment of machine-generated translations has received considerable attention
recently, resulting in metrics that attain high correlations with human judgment of translation quality
(Freitag et al., 2022b, 2023b). These automatic metrics are meant to assess the quality of a translation
across multiple dimensions (e.g. fluency, adequacy) and can provide reliable feedback when human
judgments are unavailable. Among these metrics, neural learned metrics that are trained on human
translation quality assessment scores or error span annotations have gained significant traction (Rei
et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2023; Guerreiro et al., 2023a; Perrella et al., 2022)."
AUTOMATIC METRICS FOR MACHINE TRANSLATION,0.07100591715976332,"For aligning automatically generated translations with human quality preferences, many works have
proposed to use automatic metrics as an alternative to human feedback during MT training (Shen
et al., 2016; Wieting et al., 2019; He et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024b) or decoding Shen et al. (2004);
Fernandes et al. (2022b); Freitag et al. (2022a, 2023a). Freitag et al. (2022a) show the efficacy of using
reference-based neural metrics as utility functions for MBR decoding over lexical alternatives. Further,
Fernandes et al. (2022a) use QE metrics like COMET-QE to select 1-best or N-best translations from
a pool of candidate hypotheses. Their analysis shows that while these automatic metrics can be useful,
they might not always reflect human preferences accurately. Additionally, extra care has to be taken
when optimizing systems for these metrics, as the improvements might be attributable to overfitting
or “gaming the metric”, rather than being genuine improvements in translation quality. Nevertheless,
these metrics encode useful information about the quality of translations and can still be useful to
obtain high-quality translations."

the computational cost of QUEST is higher than ancestral sampling, as the hypotheses are generated

MAIN FINDINGS,0.3224852071005917,"QUEST results in better translation quality-diversity trade-offs. Across language directions and
models, the samples generated by QUEST tend to have better or similar quality than ancestral
sampling as measured by XCOMET-XL.4 As QUEST does not directly use the reference-based metric,
XCOMET-XL, we reduce the chance of overfitting to the metric and thus the gains represent the ability
of QUEST to improve translation quality more realistically. We also report Comet-22 vs diversity
results in the Appendix Figure 9: the trends remain the same. The benefits of the proposed approach
are more noticeable when translating from English (EN →{DE, RU}). Specifically, for EN ↔RU,
our model improves XCOMET-XL by up to 2 points for both language models, showing the efficacy
of QUEST over ancestral sampling."

MAIN FINDINGS,0.34023668639053256,"Although ancestral exhibits better quality than QUEST for DE-EN, further analysis suggests that this
discrepancy may stem from the constraints of the QE metric used to model the translation preferences.
Notably, QUEST demonstrates significantly higher COMETKIWI-XL scores across the board (see
Appendix Figure 7), suggesting that better and more robust QE models can result in improved transla-
tion quality.5 Furthermore, WMT23 DE-EN includes short passages that might require additional
steps to reach the high-density regions. Based on a length analysis (See Appendix C.2), we observe
that the quality of QUEST lags behind ancestral sampling, specifically for longer sentences. We leave
the exploration of finding optimal steps for convergence and adapting the proposal distribution for
document-level MT to future work."

We compute the set overlap for QUEST and
ancestral samples (T = 128) with an independent draw of 512 ancestral samples to investigate
whether our approach results in hypotheses from unexplored regions (Fig. 3a). Compared to ancestral,
QUEST results in hypotheses that are not found in the larger pool (4×) of ancestral samples as
illustrated by a higher mass at the overlap value of 0. This demonstrates that QUEST effectively gets
to regions of the output manifold that would be less likely sampled by the LM and still attain, on
average, better quality and diversity."
ABLATION ANALYSIS,0.3520710059171598,"Average reward improves over decoding steps.
Figure 3b shows the average reward with in-
creasing decoding steps and the sample size for QUEST and ancestral respectively. As ancestral
results in independent samples, the mean reward estimate remains unchanged for different sample
sizes. However, for QUEST, hypotheses are gradually sampled in the direction of higher-quality
regions, closer to the target density, resulting in increased average reward with more steps. We can
also observe that the standard deviation of the reward over all samples decreases with the increasing
number of steps, suggesting that the model eventually reaches a better target distribution."
ABLATION ANALYSIS,0.35502958579881655,"5Kocmi et al. (2024) report that a difference of 2.7 COMETKIWI-XL on average is statistically significant

ABLATION ANALYSIS,0.35798816568047337,"High β value results in higher acceptance rates.
Figure 3c shows the distribution of accepted
samples when varying β, considering all (blue) versus unique (red) accepted samples. As expected,
on average, the number of accepted samples is smaller than the number of steps T depending upon
the rejection rate—low β values lead to higher rejection rates. Furthermore, within the accepted
samples, we also observe many repeats. This can be attributed to the observation that the language
model has a low entropy distribution for continuations when the sample indices lie at the end of
sentences. Moreover, for probable sentences, only a few have a high reward, which could result in the
Markov chain getting stuck in a particular state. Increasing the temperature of the LM or adjusting
the index distribution to have less density in the last few tokens could potentially reduce the number
of repeats. We leave this exploration to future work."
ABLATION ANALYSIS,0.3609467455621302,"Our sentence-level proposal generates better candidates.
For a random example sampled from
the WMT23 dataset, we generate 25k hypotheses using three proposal distributions: a) token-level
modification with uniform probability b) token-level modification with full posterior presented in
Eq. 8, and c) our sentence-level proposal (Eq. 10) and calculate the reward differences between the
original (y) and the generated hypothesis (y′): r(y′, x) −r(y, x). Figure 3d shows its distribution:
for proposals (a) and (b), the reward for the generated hypotheses is almost always lower than the
initial translation. On the other hand, our proposal results in assigning half of the probability mass to
hypotheses that improve over y, leading to faster convergence over token-level alternatives."

Related Work"
RELATED WORK,0.3668639053254438,"Sampling from Intractable Gibbs distributions.
Several methods have been proposed to sample
approximately from Gibbs distributions in text generation using autoregressive and masked-language
models. Prior works (Miao et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020) use MH with a proposal distribution that
makes token-level modifications for constrained generation tasks. Since masked language models
(MLM) do not have a straightforward mechanism for sampling text, MCMC has been widely explored
using variations of Gibbs sampling (Berglund et al., 2015; Su et al., 2018; Wang and Cho, 2019;
Yamakoshi et al., 2022). However, Goyal et al. (2022) shows that the masked conditional distributions
from MLMs result in invalid Gibbs samplers and, therefore, proposes to use MH on the masked
conditionals, resulting in higher-quality text. Mireshghallah et al. (2022); Forristal et al. (2023) build
on this work and use MLMs for sampling from Gibbs distributions. Some works (Kumar et al., 2022;
Qin et al., 2022; Amini et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023) also adapt the Hamiltonian MCMC algorithms
originally designed for high-dimensional continuous distributions for the discrete scenario (Duane
et al., 1987; Neal, 2011). Furthermore, Hu et al. (2024) apply GFlowNets (Bengio et al., 2021)
to fine-tune language models for solving posterior inference problems, which can be considered
as sampling in proportion to an intractable Gibbs distribution. In our work, we instead aim to use
MCMC for MT to sample translations in proportion to a sentence-level evaluation metric."
RELATED WORK,0.3698224852071006,"Diverse Decoding for Machine Translation.
Variants of beam search (Cho, 2016; Vijayakumar
et al., 2017; Kulikov et al., 2019; Tam, 2020) have been proposed to produce a diverse set of
translations using diversity-promoting objectives. However, the increased computation cost with the
model size and beam width makes it infeasible and impractical to use with LLMs and it fails to yield
consistent improvement over ancestral with an increase in beam width (Stahlberg and Byrne, 2019;
Eikema and Aziz, 2020; Pang et al., 2024). Quality-aware decoding approaches on the other hand
are almost always used to generate a single best hypothesis. Concurrently, Jinnai et al. (2024) add
diversity promoting objective to MBR decoding to generate a set of high-quality diverse candidates.
However, their approach only allows for the selection of hypotheses from a predefined set. We further
note that we do not directly promote diversity—rather, diverse translations are a side product of
efficiently exploring multiple high-quality regions from the model’s distribution."

LIMITATIONS AND BROAD IMPACT,0.3816568047337278,"8
Limitations and Broad Impact"
LIMITATIONS AND BROAD IMPACT,0.38461538461538464,"QUEST requires generating many samples to reach high-density regions sequentially from an LLM
for each input prompt, which can be computationally expensive for time-critical applications. Addi-
tionally, the required number of steps may vary depending on the input and the quality of the initial
hypothesis. Furthermore, our proposal distribution only modifies the sentence suffix, which becomes
restrictive once the chain reaches a high-quality region. As at this point, only minor changes to the
hypothesis are accepted, slowing the mixing process. Addressing these limitations and extending this
approach to other NLP tasks are avenues for future work."
LIMITATIONS AND BROAD IMPACT,0.3875739644970414,"Furthermore, we leverage recent advances in QE methods for MT and integrate them directly
in the generation process of LLMs, which can potentially reduce the errors generated by these
systems. However, despite the high correlations of evaluation metrics with human judgments, they
are sometimes hard to interpret and occasionally fail to detect simple mistakes such as incorrect
translations of numbers or entities (Amrhein and Sennrich, 2022). In such cases, sampling from
the Gibbs distributions induced by these metrics might increase the chances of sampling those
erroneous translations. We believe these risks will be mitigated as better metrics are constantly being
developed—our method, being agnostic to the specific quality metric, will directly benefit from it. In
addition, since QUEST supports any Gibbs distribution, it can also incorporate multiple QE models or
additional checks which can rule out problematic samples by assigning them a very low QE score."

our sampling strategy, QUEST, results in the best approximation of the ground truth distribution.

decoding via MCMC as shown in Figure 5a. One possible factor could be the uniform index-
selection exploration strategy where the proposal might require more steps as the sentence length
increases. Another factor could be the limitations of the reward function itself for selecting high-
quality translations for longer sequences. As these quality estimation metrics have not been trained
on longer sequences, due to a distribution shift, they might not be representative of true quality for
these output lengths. We believe the latter option could be the more significant factor as the reward
optimized still improves regardless of the sentence length (see Figure 7)."

values tighten acceptance criteria, favoring states with higher rewards and a greater likelihood of

the end of the sentence. Altering the beginning necessitates sampling small indices values, risking a
complete sentence change. This plot highlights the current limitations of our proposal, especially the

CLAIMS,0.7810650887573964,"Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present the main contributions and results in the last two paragraphs of the
appendix which are supported by experiments detailed in Section 4 and findings presented
in Section 5.2.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.7840236686390533,"• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.7869822485207101,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present some of the limitations of our work in the ablation analysis
presented in Section 5.2, additionally, we list other limitations in Section 8.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.7899408284023669,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8165680473372781,Justification: We provide all necessary details to reproduce the experiments in Section 4.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8195266272189349,Guidelines:
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8224852071005917,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results."

OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.8284023668639053,"Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We use publicly available models and datasets in our experiments. We release
the code to replicate our experiments at https://www.questdecoding.com/.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.8313609467455622,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details"

7. Experiment Statistical Significance"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.8402366863905325,"Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We show all our results aggregated over a sample size of 500-2000 source
sentences across multiple language pairs and models. Furthermore, we report statistical
significance for results using the optimized QE metric in Section 5 and Appendix C.5.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.8431952662721893,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper."
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.8461538461538461,"• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text."

BROADER IMPACTS,0.9023668639053254,"• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."

SAFEGUARDS,0.9112426035502958,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.9142011834319527,"Justification: Our work poses no such risks. We utilize existing models and resources to
improve translation quality."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9171597633136095,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9201183431952663,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
