ABSTRACT,0.0,Abstract
ABSTRACT,0.0027100271002710027,"Recent work suggests that large language models may implicitly learn world models.
How should we assess this possibility? We formalize this question for the case
where the underlying reality is governed by a deterministic finite automaton. This
includes problems as diverse as simple logical reasoning, geographic navigation,
game-playing, and chemistry. We propose new evaluation metrics for world model
recovery inspired by the classic Myhill-Nerode theorem from language theory. We
illustrate their utility in three domains: game playing, logic puzzles, and navigation.
In all domains, the generative models we consider do well on existing diagnostics
for assessing world models, but our evaluation metrics reveal their world models
to be far less coherent than they appear. Such incoherence creates fragility: using
a generative model to solve related but subtly different tasks can lead to failures.
Building generative models that meaningfully capture the underlying logic of the
domains they model would be immensely valuable; our results suggest new ways
to assess how close a given model is to that goal."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.008130081300813009,"Large language models (LLMs) appear to have capacities that far exceed the next-token prediction
task they were trained to perform [17, 39, 35]. Recent work suggests a reason: they are implicitly
recovering high-fidelity representations of the underlying domains they are trained on [1, 20]."
INTRODUCTION,0.01084010840108401,"An algorithm that recovers a “world model” from sequence data would be extremely valuable. As
an example, consider how one might build a navigation tool today: meticulously map each street and
intersection, and then use a search algorithm to provide directions. The success of language models
suggests an alternative approach: collect turn-by-turn sequences from trips in a city (e.g. “East
North...”) and then train a sequence model on them. If the sequence model successfully recovers
the world model, we would obtain a map of the city without ever mapping it and a routing algorithm
simply by predicting the next turn. This example is not far-fetched: it is the reason language models
are used in scientific domains such as protein generation, genetics and chemistry [7, 21, 3, 14, 6]."
INTRODUCTION,0.013550135501355014,"All of this relies on the presumption that the sequence model has recovered the true world model;
but how can we test whether it actually has? Answering this question requires first defining what
we mean by the true world model. Toshniwal et al. [36] and Li et al. [20] proposed a concrete and
influential approach: study whether sequence models trained on board game transcripts (e.g. chess
and Othello) recover the underlying game rules. Inspired by this approach, we consider the case where
the underlying world can be summarized by a finite collection of states and rules governing transitions
between the states; this includes many domains such as logic [19], location tracking [28, 9], games
[36, 20], and several of the scientific applications described above. As a result, the “world” in these
domains can be modeled as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA)."
INTRODUCTION,0.016260162601626018,"We show the difficulty in evaluating implicit world models. Consider an existing approach: for a
given sequence, compare the next tokens outputted by the generative model to the set of valid next
tokens for the state implied by that sequence [36, 20]. Though intuitive, this approach can fail to
diagnose severe problems, and we illustrate this concretely. The classic Myhill-Nerode theorem
[26, 27] provides intuition: every pair of distinct states can be distinguished by some sequence
(admitted by one state but not the other). Unless those minimal distinguishing sequences are of length
one, looking at the next single token outputted will not reliably assess whether the generative model
has an accurate model of the underlying state."
INTRODUCTION,0.018970189701897018,"The logic of Myhill-Nerode suggests two metrics for measuring whether a generative model effectively
captures underlying states and transitions. The first metric summarizes sequence compression: under
the DFA, sequences that lead to the same state must have the same continuations; so one can test
whether the generative model has similar sequences of outputs when started on these two sequences.
The second metric summarizes sequence distinction: under the DFA, two sequences that lead to
distinct states should have distinct continuations; so one can test whether the generative model matches
these distinct outputs when started at these two sequences. We formally define these metrics and
provide model-agnostic procedures for calculating them when given query access to the true DFA."
INTRODUCTION,0.02168021680216802,"To illustrate these ideas, we first take the stylized mapping example literally. We construct a turn-by-
turn sequence dataset of taxi rides in New York City. We then assess to what extent transformers
successfully recover the true street map of Manhattan. By the usual metrics, the transformers do
very well: their predicted next-direction is a valid turn nearly 100% of the time and their state
representations even appear to encode the current location of the ride. Our evaluation methods
reveal they are very far from recovering the true street map of New York City. As a visualization,
we use graph reconstruction techniques to recover each model’s implicit street map of New York
City. The resulting map bears little resemblance to the actual streets of Manhattan, containing streets
with impossible physical orientations and flyovers above other streets (see Figure 3). Because these
transformers fail to recover the true street map of New York City, they are fragile for downstream
tasks. While they sometimes have amazing route planning abilities, their performance breaks down
when detours are introduced."
INTRODUCTION,0.024390243902439025,"These results are not unique to maps and navigation. For both Othello and logic puzzles, we use our
evaluation metrics to show language models can perform remarkably well on some tasks despite
being far from recovering the true world model. These results demonstrate the importance of using
theoretically-grounded evaluation metrics if our goal is to build language models that capture accurate
world models of the domains they are trained in. We release our benchmark dataset of taxi rides in
New York City along with software implementing our evaluation metrics.1"
INTRODUCTION,0.02710027100271003,"Related work. Our paper builds on influential work studying whether generative models recover a
world model in the context of games. Toshniwal et al. [36] and Li et al. [20] pioneered the study of games
as a testbed for world model evaluation, studying tests for chess and Othello, respectively, which were
further studied by Hazineh et al. [10] and Kuo et al. [18]. Our evaluation metrics apply to these games
because they are DFAs. A common method for assessing whether a trained model has recovered a world
model uses probes that assess whether a neural network’s representation can recover some real-world
state [11, 19, 1, 16, 20]. By contrast, our evaluation metrics are model-agnostic: they’re based only on
sequences. While the results from our evaluation metrics sometimes align with those used in existing
work, they also reveal incoherence in world models that are not captured by existing diagnostics."
INTRODUCTION,0.02981029810298103,"We study whether a language model trained on sequences of directions recovers the true underlying map.
This question relates to other state tracking and navigation problems studied in the language modeling lit-
erature [31, 32]. For example, Patel & Pavlick [28] show that larger LLMs ground spatial concepts like
cardinal directions to locations in a grid world and generalize to various grid layouts. Relatedly, Schu-
mann & Riezler [30] demonstrate that transformer-based models can generate navigation instructions
in language from underlying graphs. Additionally, Guan et al. [9] use LLMs to perform planning tasks
from natural language descriptions. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform some of these tasks well
(such as finding shortest paths between two points on a map) without having a coherent world model."
INTRODUCTION,0.032520325203252036,"Additionally, our evaluation metrics compare the language accepted by a sequence model to that
of an underlying DFA. Existing work studies whether transformers and other sequence models are
theoretically capable of recognizing languages in different complexity classes [34, 4, 22, 23, 24]."

INTRODUCTION,0.037940379403794036,"Most relevant to our work, Liu et al. [22] show that low-depth transformers can theoretically represent
any finite state automata, and show that transformers trained explicitly to predict their labeled states
are capable of doing so. In contrast, our paper doesn’t aim to study whether models are theoretically
capable of recovering underlying automata or whether they can do so when given state labels. Instead,
we provide metrics for assessing how closely a given model recovers the underlying DFA."

take turns dropping a disk in a column, and they can choose any column that contains less than 𝑛disks.
When a disk is dropped in a column, it occupies the bottom-most position that isn’t occupied by another
disk, and it remains in that position for the full game. The game continues until the entire board is
filled, for 7𝑛moves, regardless of whether a player has achieved four in a row. Games are represented
as sequences of moves, where each sequence has 7𝑛tokens and each token is an integer between 1 and
7 indicating the column the disk is placed in. Here, Σ = {1, . . . , 7} denotes the columns and the state
corresponds to the count in each column. A column is a valid move if that column is not already filled."

about the board. However, for any board where there are no columns filled, this model provides a valid
next move (e.g., the right panel of Figure 1), and so it will be a near-perfect next-token predictor when
𝑛is large. For example, when 𝑛= 1000, it predicts a valid next move for more than 99% of all states.

THE MYHILL-NERODE INTERIOR AND BOUNDARY,0.1111111111111111,"Cumulative Connect-4 points to a general fragility in next-token prediction as an evaluation metric
that can be understood in the context of the Myhill-Nerode theorem [26, 27], a classic result from
language theory. The Myhill-Nerode theorem states that the sets of sequences accepted by a minimal
DFA starting at two distinct states are distinct (see Appendix C for a full statement). More formally,
for states 𝑞1 ≠𝑞2, we have 𝐿𝑊(𝑞1) ≠𝐿𝑊(𝑞2). However, while distinct, the two sets may exhibit a
great deal of overlap. Cumulative Connect-4 exhibits this behavior; any board for which there are less

Evaluating world models"
EVALUATING WORLD MODELS,0.24119241192411925,"To assess their capabilities, we first assess whether the trained models can recover the shortest paths
between unseen (origin, destination) pairs. We prompt each model with (origin, destination) pairs
from the test set and use greedy decoding to generate a set of directions. All models consistently
generate valid traversals — between 96% and 99%. Impressively, 97% of the sequences generated
by the shortest paths model are the true shortest path, and 94% of the sequences generated by the
model trained on noisy shortest paths find a shortest path for one of the noisy graphs used to generate
data. Figure 5 provides an example of a shortest path traversal."
EVALUATING WORLD MODELS,0.24390243902439024,"To assess whether these capabilities correspond to coherent implicit world models, we first consider
two existing diagnostics [36, 20]. The next-token test assesses whether a model, when conditioned
on each subsequence in the test set, predicts a legal turn for its top-1 predicted next-token. In our
example, a directional move is legal if a street in the direction exists at the current intersection.
Predicting the end token is only legal if the traversal implied by the sequence is at the listed destination.
Meanwhile, the current-state probe trains a probe [11] from a transformer’s representation to predict
the current intersection implied by the directions so far. We train a linear probe on a transformer’s
last layer representation."
EVALUATING WORLD MODELS,0.24661246612466126,"To implement the sequence compression metric, we randomly sample states (i.e., [intersection,
destination] pairs) and two distinct traversals (i.e. prefixes) that arrive at each state. We then assess
whether a model correctly admits the same suffixes for each prefix. We average over pairs of prefixes
to report a score for each state and average over states to report a final score. To implement the
sequence distinction metrics, we sample pairs of distinct states and traversals (i.e. prefixes) that
arrive at each state, comparing the model’s approximate Myhill-Nerode boundary to the true one.
We average over pairs of prefixes to report a score for each pair of states, and average over 1000
randomly sampled state pairs to report a final scores. Both metrics depend on a threshold parameter
𝜖: a prefix is only sampled or accepted if the model’s assigned probability for each token is above 𝜖.
Here, we consider 𝜖= 0.01 for all models and metrics. We describe implementation details, provide
parameter ablations, and consider other acceptance rules (e.g. top-p and top-k) in Appendix E."

transformers perform poorly on sequence compression, frequently failing to recognize that two

on random walks, which sees many distinct types of traversals during training, fails to compress
prefixes for half the states. For the sequence distinction metrics, the transformers trained on shortest
paths or noisy shortest paths perform poorly. In contrast, the transformer trained on random walks
performs well on the sequence distinction metric. Both metrics are therefore valuable for evaluating
world models; a model can perform well on one metric and poorly on the other. Here, a model that"

metrics reveal underlying incoherence. In the maps setting, the state structure of the true world model
is easy to interpret and visualize: it is defined by the map itself. We attempt to “reconstruct” the map
implied by sequences sampled from each generative model."
RECONSTRUCTING IMPLICIT MAPS,0.27100271002710025,"Reconstruction is an open-ended problem: the generative model produces directions between an origin
and destination that do not necessarily correspond to a fixed graph over the intersections in Manhattan.
To narrow the scope, our goal is to produce a visually interpretable reconstructed map. To that end, we
fix the reconstructed graph to have the same set of vertices as the true world model, corresponding to
intersections in Manhattan, and ensure that the reconstruction algorithm returns a map consistent with
the true model whenever it is run on valid sequences. Further, (a) we enforce each node has at most one
outgoing edge of any direction, (b) we limit the maximum degree of each node, and (c) we limit the
Euclidean distance spanned by any edge. Altogether, our reconstruction algorithm gives the generative
model the benefit of the doubt, attempting to reconstruct edges belonging to the true map until forced
to do otherwise in order to map a generated sequence. The algorithm is detailed in Appendix B."

destination) pairs and then sampling the model’s traversal for each pair (Appendix G shows similar
results for when the distribution of origin/destination pairs follows the sampling distribution used
to train each model). On the left is the reconstructed map on only sequences which are valid under
the true world model. On the right is the reconstructed map using the transformer’s sequences.
The transformer’s underlying world model is incoherent; it recovers streets whose orientations are
physically impossible (e.g. labeled NW but facing east) and require flyovers above other streets."

the probability of an error for the random walks transformer, we randomly re-label an edge in a sequence
consistent with the world model. The middle panel of Figure 3 shows the reconstructed graph. It is much
closer to the true world model than the transformer (which makes errors at the same rate). While these
results are for random walks and one setting of graph reconstruction, Appendix G shows maps for the
other models and different reconstruction settings. All settings recover incoherent underlying maps."

Implication of failing to recover the world model: detour fragility"
RECONSTRUCTING IMPLICIT MAPS,0.2926829268292683,"Does it matter that the transformer has an incoherent world model? After all, it does very well at the
practical task of finding shortest paths. Here we look at a slightly adjacent task and consider a driver
facing detours while driving; how well does the model re-route?"
RECONSTRUCTING IMPLICIT MAPS,0.2953929539295393,"Concretely, we feed each transformer an (origin, destination) pair from the test set and greedily
decode a traversal. But with probability 𝑝for each token, we add one of two kinds of detours: for
“random detours”, the model’s proposed token is replaced with a randomly chosen (true) valid token;
for “adversarial detours”, it is replaced with the model’s lowest ranked valid token. We always
ensure a valid path to the destination exists (shorter than length 100) after each detour. Table 2
shows the fraction of valid traversals produced. While all models perform well initially, detours
erode performance, illustrating how faulty world models can prove problematic. Notably, the
transformer trained on random walks is more robust to detours than models trained on (noisy) shortest
paths, mirroring its advantage on our proposed evaluation metrics. The similarity between model
performance on these evaluation metrics and detour robustness illustrates the effectiveness of our
proposed metrics for assessing world model recovery."

board game that consists of players placing tokens on an 8x8 board. They train transformers on game
transcripts to predict the next move of each game. They show these models perform well on both the
next-token test and current-state probe considered in Section 2.4. Since the true Othello game can be rep-
resented as a DFA, we can apply our world model evaluation metrics. The sequence compression metric
assesses whether openings that lead to the same board position have the same predicted next moves,
while the sequence distinction metrics assess whether the model can differentiate two distinct boards."
RECONSTRUCTING IMPLICIT MAPS,0.3062330623306233,"We apply our metrics to the two Othello sequence models considered by Li et al. [20]: one trained on

Appendix D reports the metrics in both settings. The model trained on real games performs poorly on
both compression and distinction metrics, failing to group together most pairs of game openings that
lead to the same board. In contrast, the model trained on synthetic games performs well on both metrics.
This discernment is not captured by the existing metrics, which show both models performing similarly.
We validate this discernment by performing a “detours” exercise for Othello in Table 4 in Appendix D;
while the model trained on synthetic data produces near-perfect games regardless of detours, the model
trained on championship data fails immediately. Similar to the navigation setting, we again find that

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.34146341463414637,"In order to build high-fidelity algorithms that meaningfully capture the logic of the problems they
model, we need ways to measure how close we are to that goal. This paper suggests theoretically
grounded metrics for assessing the world models implicit inside generative models. Applications to
maps, games, and logic puzzles suggest these metrics are both feasible to implement and insightful.
Our results show that generative models can perform impressive tasks with incoherent world models
(e.g. provide directions for taxi rides). But this incoherence makes them fragile for other tasks (e.g.
providing directions when there are detours). This incoherence is also problematic when we hope to
use a generative model to learn something latent about the world in scientific domains."
CONCLUSION,0.34417344173441733,"Our primary limitation is the focus on DFAs. While it is suitable for many applications like games, logic,
and state tracking, extending it would be quite valuable, e.g. to situations where the underlying world
model is more complicated than a DFA or is unknown. We suspect that the core ideas related to sequence
compression and sequence distinction generalize to these richer settings, but leave that to future work."

of size 𝑘by only sampling 𝑘-length suffixes to approximate a model’s Myhill-Nerode boundary. For

boundary based on 𝑘-length suffixes. The results in Figure 6 show the importance of considering
larger boundaries as opposed to smaller ones (e.g. single next-tokens); for example, while the model

evaluating a transformer on exponentially many outputs. However, we don’t actually need to compute
the full boundary; the precision is 0 any time there’s one sequence accepted by one prefix and not the
other. So we approximate precision by Monte-Carlo sampling. We sample 𝑀complete sequences
from the model conditioned 𝑠1, insuring that each token has higher than 𝜖probability. We then check
if each token in the sequence has higher than 𝜖probability when the model is conditioned on 𝑠2. If

set of statements consistent with 𝑞that don’t narrow down the state space until the state implied by
the statements is exactly that of 𝑞. The compression metric is failed for each state for which we can
find a suffix that is accepted by the model prompted with one sequence but not the other. We sample
5 different possible continuation statements, half the time from the set of valid statements, half the
time uniformly at random. We note that due to the nature of the compression metric, our reported
metric is an overestimate of true capability. So the fact that no model performs above 0.35 with only
5 samples suggests heavy compression failure. We sample 100 states. See Figure 8 for an example of

in Manhattan, resulting in 3,358,737 sequences. We use the OSMnx library [5] to represent New

terms of latitude/longitude. The graph consists of 4,580 nodes, 9,846 edges, and each node has a

2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.8455284552845529,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper discusses limitations in the conclusion.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8482384823848238,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address
problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important
role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will
be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8617886178861789,4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8644986449864499,"Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?"
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8672086720867209,Answer: [Yes]
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8699186991869918,"Justification: We describe implementation details and dataset construction details in depth

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8726287262872628,Guidelines:
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8753387533875339,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well
by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether
the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all
submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend
on the nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the
dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors
are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the
case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some
way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have
some path to reproducing or verifying the results."

OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.8834688346883469,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run
to reproduce the results.
See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines
(https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

Justification: The paper reports standard errors for experimental results.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.8943089430894309,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the
main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.8970189701897019,"• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of
the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text."

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations

groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations."
BROADER IMPACTS,0.948509485094851,"• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."

SAFEGUARDS,0.959349593495935,Justification: The paper does not release any data or models that pose a high risk for misuse.
SAFEGUARDS,0.962059620596206,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.964769647696477,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
