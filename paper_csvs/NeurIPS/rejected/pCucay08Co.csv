The data points represent the sample averages of the cost variation range ∆H,ρ via varying a single-
qubit unitary over the spectral width w(H) as a function of the number of qubits on semi-log plots.
Panel (a) and (b) correspond to the VQE with the 1-dimensional Heisenberg model and the quantum
autoencoder with one qubit discarded, respectively, where the error bars represent the standard
deviations over samples. Panel (c) corresponds to the quantum state learning with the cost function
being the fidelity with the zero state. Different legends stand for V1, V2 or both being approximate

three tasks where the scaling exponents show a good coincidence with the experimental results."
