ABSTRACT,0.0028011204481792717,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0056022408963585435,"We argue that a form of the valuable information provided by the auxiliary informa-
tion is its implied data clustering information. For instance, considering hashtags
as auxiliary information, we can hypothesize that an Instagram image will be
semantically more similar with the same hashtags. With this intuition, we present a
two-stage weakly-supervised contrastive learning approach. The ﬁrst stage is to
cluster data according to its auxiliary information. The second stage is to learn
similar representations within the same cluster and dissimilar representations for
data from different clusters. Our empirical experiments suggest the following three
contributions. First, compared to conventional self-supervised representations, the
auxiliary-information-infused representations bring the performance closer to the
supervised representations, which use direct downstream labels as supervision
signals. Second, our approach performs the best in most cases, when comparing
our approach with other baseline representation learning methods that also leverage
auxiliary data information. Third, we show that our approach also works well with
unsupervised constructed clusters (e.g., no auxiliary information), resulting in a
strong unsupervised representation learning approach."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.011204481792717087,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) designs learning objectives that use data’s self-information but not
labels. As a result, SSL empowers us to leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to learn good
representations, and its applications span computer vision (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020), natural
language processing (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018) and speech processing (Schneider et al.,
2019; Baevski et al., 2020). More than leveraging only data’s self-information, this paper is interested
in a weakly-supervised setting by assuming access to additional sources as auxiliary information for
data, such as the hashtags as auxiliary attributes information for Instagram images. The auxiliary
information can provide valuable but often noisy information. Hence, it raises a research challenge of
how we can effectively leveraging useful information from auxiliary information."
INTRODUCTION,0.014005602240896359,"We argue that a form of the valuable information provided by the auxiliary information is its implied
data clustering information. For example, we can expect an Instagram image to be semantically
more similar to the image with the same hashtags than those with different hashtags. Hence, our ﬁrst
step is constructing auxiliary-information-determined clusters. Speciﬁcally, we build data clusters
such that the data from the same cluster have similar auxiliary information, such as having the
same data auxiliary attributes. Then, our second step is to minimize the intra-cluster difference of
the representations. Particularly, we present a contrastive approach - the clustering InfoNCE (Cl-
InfoNCE) objective to learn similar representations for augmented variants of data within the same
cluster and dissimilar representations for data from different clusters. To conclude, the presented two-
stage approach leverages the structural information from the auxiliary information, then integrating
the structural information into a contrastive representation learning process. See Figure 1 for an
overview of our approach."

higher mutual information between the labels and the auxiliary-information-determined clusters and
ii) lower conditional entropy of the clusters given the labels. Second, Cl-InfoNCE generalizes recent
contrastive learning objectives by changing the way to construct the clusters. In particular, when each
cluster contains only one data point, Cl-InfoNCE becomes a conventional self-supervised contrastive
objective (e.g., the InfoNCE objective (Oord et al., 2018)). When the clusters are built using directly
the labels, Cl-InfoNCE becomes a supervised contrastive objective (e.g., the objective considered
by Khosla et al. (2020)). These generalizations imply that our approach (auxiliary-information-
determined clusters + Cl-InfoNCE) interpolates between conventional self-supervised and supervised
representation learning."
INTRODUCTION,0.03081232492997199,"We conduct experiments on learning visual representations using UT-zappos50K (Yu & Grauman,
2014), CUB-200-2011 (Wah et al., 2011), Wider Attribute (Li et al., 2016) and ImageNet-100 (Rus-
sakovsky et al., 2015) datasets. For the ﬁrst set of experiments, we shall see how much improvement
can the auxiliary information bring to us. We consider the derivative auxiliary information, which
means the auxiliary information comes from the datasets: the discrete attributes from UT-zappos50K,
CUB-200-2011, and Wider Attribute. We show that the auxiliary-information-infused weakly-
supervised representations, compared to conventional self-supervised representation, have a much
better performance on downstream tasks. We consider two baselines that also leverage auxiliary
information: i) predicting the auxiliary-information-induced clusters with cross-entropy loss and ii)
adopting the contrastive multi-view coding (CMC) (Tian et al., 2020) method when treating auxiliary
information as another view of data. Our approach consistently outperforms the cross-entropy method
and performs better than the CMC method in most cases. For the second set of experiments, we
focus on the analysis of Cl-InfoNCE to study how well it works with unsupervised constructed
clusters (K-means clusters). We ﬁnd it achieves better performance comparing to the clustering-based
self-supervised learning approaches, such as the Prototypical Contrastive Learning (PCL) (Li et al.,
2020) method. The result suggests that the K-means method + Cl-InfoNCE can be a strong baseline
for the conventional self-supervised learning setting."

objective (Oord et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020), Wasserstein Predictive Coding (Ozair

contrastive approaches aim to learn representations that are invariant to data augmentations."
RELATED WORK,0.047619047619047616,"There is another line of work combining clustering and contrastive approaches, such as HUBERT (Hsu
et al., 2020), Prototypical Contrastive Learning (Li et al., 2020) and Wav2Vec (Schneider et al., 2019;
Baevski et al., 2020). They ﬁrst construct (unsupervised) clusters from the data. Then, they perform a
contrastive approach to learn similar representations for the data within the same cluster. Our approach
relates to these work with two differences: 1) we construct the clusters from the auxiliary information;
and 2) we present Cl-InfoNCE as a new contrastive approach and characterize the goodness for
the resulting representations. Recent works like IDFD (Tao et al., 2021) aim to achieve better
unsupervised clustering by using contrastive learning representations. However, Tao et al. (2021)
differs from our work in that they don’t directly incorporate auxiliary information into contrastive
objectives."
RELATED WORK,0.05042016806722689,"Weakly-supervised Learning with Auxiliary Information.
Our study relates to work on predic-
tion using auxiliary information, by treating the auxiliary information as weak labels (Sun et al.,
2017; Mahajan et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2019). The weak labels
can be hashtags of Instagram images (Mahajan et al., 2018), metadata such as identity and nationality
of a person (Wen et al., 2018) or corresponding textual descriptions for images (Radford et al.,
2021). Compared to normal labels, the weak labels are noisy but require much less human annotation
work. Surprisingly, it has been shown that the network learned with weakly supervised pre-training
tasks can generalize well to various downstream tasks, including object detection and segmentation,
cross-modality matching, and action recognition (Mahajan et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2021). The
main difference between these works and ours is that our approach does not consider a prediction
objective but a contrastive learning objective (i.e., the Cl-InfoNCE objective). An independent and
concurrent work (Zheng et al., 2021) also incorporates weak labels into the contrastive learning
objective. However, our method differs from Zheng et al. (2021) by the the way we construct the
weak labels. We perform clustering on the annotative attributes or unsupervised k-means to obtain
weak labels whereas they employ connected components labeling process. Task-wise, (Zheng et al.,
2021) focuses on unsupervised (no access to data labels) and semi-supervised (access to a few data
labels) representation learning, and ours focuses on weakly-supervised (access to side information
such as data attributes) and unsupervised representation learning. For the common unsupervised
representation learning part, we include a comparison with their method in the Appendix."

learns representations that can capture the joint information between the data and the accompanying
auxiliary information. The main difference between CMC and our approach is that CMC leverages
auxiliary information directly and Cl-InfoNCE leverages it indirectly (i.e., our approach pre-processes
auxiliary information by clustering it)."

CLUSTER CONSTRUCTION FOR DISCRETE ATTRIBUTES,0.07282913165266107,"We consider discrete attributes as the auxiliary information. An example of such auxiliary information
is binary indicators of attributes, such as “short/long hair”, “with/without sunglasses” or “short/long
sleeves”, for human photos. We construct the clusters such that data within each cluster will have the
same values for a set of attributes. In our running example, selecting hair and sunglasses as the set of
attributes, the human photos with “long hair” and “with sunglasses” will form a cluster. Then, how
we determine the set of attributes? First, we rank each attribute according to its entropy in the dataset.
Note that if an attribute has high entropy, it means this attribute is distributed diversely. Then, we
select the attributes with top-k highest entropy, where k is a hyper-parameter. The reason for this
selection process is to make sure the selected attributes are informative. See Figure 2 for illustration."

CLUSTER CONSTRUCTION FOR DISCRETE ATTRIBUTES,0.0784313725490196,"This section presents how we integrate the clustering information of data into the representation
learning process. Recently, the contrastive approaches (Chen et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2020) have
attracted lots of attention for self-supervised and supervised representation learning. The goal is
to learn similar representations for correlated data and dissimilar representations for uncorrelated
data. To be more speciﬁc, the self-supervised setting (e.g., the InfoNCE objective (Oord et al., 2018))
regards different views of the same data as correlated and distinct data as uncorrelated; the supervised
setting (e.g., the supervised contrastive objective (Khosla et al., 2020)) regards the data with the same
downstream label as correlated and the data with distinct labels as uncorrelated. Inspired by these
methods, when performing weakly-supervised representation learning, we present to learn similar
representations for data within the same cluster assignment, and vice versa. To this end, we extend
from the self-supervised InfoNCE objective and introduce the clustering InfoNCE (Cl-InfoNCE)
objective that takes the data clustering information into account. With the alphabets X and Y denoting

In Theorem 3.2, we show that maximizing Cl-

to characterize how good is the learned representations by maximizing Cl-InfoNCE or to perform
cross validation, we can instead study the relations between Z and the downstream labels (denoting
by T). In particular, we can use information-theoretical metrics such as the mutual information
I(Z; T) and the conditional entropy H(Z|T) to characterize the goodness of the learned representa-
tions. I(Z; T) measures how relevant the clusters and the labels, and H(Z|T) measures how much
redundant information in the clusters that are irrelevant to the labels. For instance, we can expect
good downstream performance for our auxiliary-information-infused representations when having
high mutual information and low conditional entropy between the auxiliary-information-determined
clusters and the labels. It is worth noting that, when Z and T are both discrete variables, computing
I(Z; T) and H(Z|T) would be much easier than computing I(X; T) and H(X|T)."

for data that are from the same downstream labels and vice versa. In our paper, the clusters Z

this purpose, we select the data discrete attributes as the auxiliary information, construct the clusters
(Z) using the discrete attributes (see Section 3.1 and Figure 2), and then adopt attributes-determined
clusters for Cl-InfoNCE. Recall our construction of data-attributes-determined clusters: we select
the attributes with top-k highest entropy and then construct the clusters such that the data within a
cluster will have the same values over the selected attributes. k is the hyper-parameter. Note that our
method considers a weakly supervised setting since the data attributes can be seen as the data’s weak
supervision."
METHODOLOGY,0.1792717086834734,"We dissect the experiments into three parts. First, we like to study the effect of the hyper-parameter k
and select its optimal value. Note that different choices of k result in different constructed clusters
Z. Our study is based on the information-theoretical metrics (i.e., I(Z; T) and H(Z|T) between the
constructed clusters (Z) and the labels (T)) and their relations with the downstream performance of
the learned representations. Second, we perform comparisons between different levels of supervision.
In particular, we include the comparisons with the supervised (Z = downstream labels T) and the
conventional self-supervised (Z = instance ID) setting for our method. We show in Section 3.2,
the supervised setting is equivalent to the Supervised Contrastive Learning objective (Khosla et al.,
2020) and the conventional self-supervised setting is equivalent to SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020).
Third, we include baselines that leverage the auxiliary information: i) learning to predict the clusters
assignments using cross-entropy loss and ii) treating auxiliary information as another view of data
when using the contrastive multi-view coding (CMC) (Tian et al., 2020)."

METHODOLOGY,0.21008403361344538,"Part I - Effect of the hyper-parameter k.
To better understand the effect of the hyper-parameter
k for constructing the attributes-determined clusters, we study the information-theoretical metrics
between Z and T and report in Figure 4. Note that, to ensure the same scales for I(Z; T) and H(Z|T)

METHODOLOGY,0.21568627450980393,"As k increases, the mutual information I(Z; T) increases but the conditional entropy H(Z|T) also
increases. Hence, although considering more attributes leads to the clusters that are more correlated
to the downstream labels, the clusters may also contain more downstream-irrelevant information.
This is in accord with our second observation that, as k increases, the downstream performance ﬁrst
increases then decreases. Therefore, we only need a partial set of the most informative attributes
(those with high entropy) to determine the clusters. Next, we observe that the best performing clusters
happen at the intersection between I(Z; T) and negative H(Z|T). This observation helps us study
the trade-off between I(Z; T) and H(Z|T) and suggests an empirical way to select the optimal k that
achieves the best performance. It is worth noting that the above process of determining the optimal k
does not require directly evaluating the learned representations."
METHODOLOGY,0.2184873949579832,"Part II - Interpolation between Different Supervision Levels.
In Section 3.2, we discussed that,
by altering the designs of the clusters, our presented approach specializes to the conventional self-
supervised contrastive method - SimCLR (Oord et al., 2018) and the supervised contrastive method -
SupCon (Khosla et al., 2020). In particular, our approach specializes to SimCLR when considering
augmented variants of each instance as a cluster and specializes to SupCon when considering instances
with the same downstream label as a cluster. Hence, we can interpolate different supervision levels of
our approach and study how auxiliary information of data can help improve representation learning."

METHODOLOGY,0.24089635854341737,"We present the results in Table 1 with different cluster constructions along with Cl-InfoNCE. We use
the top-1 accuracy on Wider Attribute for discussions. We ﬁnd the performance grows from low to
high when having the clusters as instance ID (40.2), attributes-determined clusters (45.5) to labels
(49.9). This result suggests that CL-InfoNCE can better bridge the gap with the supervised learned
representations by using auxiliary information."
METHODOLOGY,0.24369747899159663,"Part III - Comparisons with Baselines that Leverage Auxiliary Information.
In the last part,
we see that Cl-InfoNCE can leverage auxiliary information to achieve a closer performance to
supervised representations than self-supervised representations. Nonetheless, two questions still
remain: 1) is there another way to leverage auxiliary information other than our method (attributes-
determined clusters + Cl-InfoNCE), and 2) is the weakly-supervised methods (that leverages auxiliary
information) always better than self-supervised methods? To answer these two questions, in Table 2,
we include the comparisons among weakly-supervised representation learning baselines that leverage
auxiliary information (Attributes-determined clusters + cross-entropy loss and Contrastive Multi-view
Coding (CMC) (Tian et al., 2020) when treating auxiliary information as another view of data) and
self-supervised baselines (SimCLR (Oord et al., 2018) and MoCo (He et al., 2020))."
METHODOLOGY,0.24649859943977592,"First, we ﬁnd that using auxiliary information does not always guarantee better performance than not
using it. For instance, for top-1 acc. on Wider Attribute dataset, predicting the attributes-determined
clusters using the cross-entropy loss (39.4) or treating auxiliary information as another view of data
then using CMC (34.1) perform worse than the SimCLR method (40.2), which does not utilize the
auxiliary information. The result suggests that, although auxiliary information can provide useful
information, how we can effectively leverage the auxiliary information is even more crucial."
METHODOLOGY,0.24929971988795518,"Second, we observe that our method constantly outperforms the baseline - Attributes-Determined
Clusters + Cross-Entropy loss. For instance, on ZT-Zappos50K, our method achieves 84.6 top-1
accuracy while the baseline achieves 82.7 top-1 accuracy. Note that both our method and the baseline
consider constructing clusters according to auxiliary information. The difference is that our method
adopts the contrastive approach - Cl-InfoNCE, and the baseline considers to adopt cross-entropy
loss on an additional classiﬁer between the representations and the clusters. Our observation is in
accordance with the observation from a prior work (Khosla et al., 2020). It shows that, compared to
the cross-entropy loss, the contrastive objective (e.g., our presented Cl-InfoNCE) is more robust to
natural corruptions of data, stable to hyper-parameters and optimizers settings, and enjoying better
performance."
METHODOLOGY,0.25210084033613445,"Last, we compare our method with the CMC method. We see that although our method performs
better on UT-zappos50K (84.6 over 83.7) and Wider Attributes (45.5 over 34.1) dataset, CMC
achieves signiﬁcantly better results on CUB-200-2011 (32.7 over 20.6) dataset. To explain such
differences, we recall that 1) the CMC method leverages the auxiliary information directly, while
our method leverages the auxiliary information indirectly (we use the structural information implied
from the auxiliary information); and 2) the auxiliary information used in UT-zappos50K and Wider
Attributes contains relatively little information (i.e., consisting of less than 20 discrete attributes), and
the auxiliary information used in CUB-200-2011 contains much more information (i.e., consisting
of 312 discrete attributes). We argue that since CMC leverages the auxiliary information directly, it
shall perform better with more informative auxiliary information. On the other hand, Cl-InfoNCE
performs better with less informative auxiliary information."

EXPERIMENT II: K-MEANS CLUSTERS + CL-INFONCE"
METHODOLOGY,0.2773109243697479,"So far, we see how we can combine auxiliary-information-determined clusters and Cl-InfoNCE
to learn good weakly-supervised representations. Now, we would like to show that Cl-InfoNCE
can also learn good self-supervised representations without auxiliary information. To this end, we
construct unsupervised clusters (e.g., k-means clusters on top of the learned representations) for
Cl-InfoNCE. Similar to the EM algorithm, we iteratively perform the k-means clustering to determine
the clusters for the representations, and then we adopt Cl-InfoNCE to leverage the k-means clusters
to update the representations. We select thet Prototypical Contrastive Learning (PCL) (Li et al., 2020)
as the baseline of the clustering-based self-supervised approach. In particular, PCL performs data
log-likelihood maximization by assuming data are generated from isotropic Gaussians. It considers
the MLE objective, where the author makes a connection with contrastive approaches (Chen et al.,
2020; He et al., 2020). The clusters in PCL are determined via MAP estimation. For the sake
of the completeness of the experiments, we also include the non-clustering-based self-supervised
approaches, including SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) and MoCo (He et al., 2020). Note that this set
of experiments considers the conventional self-supervised setting, in which we can leverage the
information neither from labels nor from auxiliary information."
METHODOLOGY,0.2801120448179272,"Results.
We ﬁrst look at the left table in Figure 5. We observe that, except for ImageNet-100, there
is no obvious performance difference between the non-clustering-based (i.e., SimCLR and MoCo) and
the clustering-based baseline (i.e., PCL). Since ImageNet-100 is a more complex dataset comparing to
the other three datasets, we argue that, when performing self-supervised learning, discovering latent
structures in data (via unsupervised clustering) may best beneﬁt larger-sized datasets. Additionally,
among all the approaches, our method reaches the best performance. The result suggests our method
can be as competitive as other conventional self-supervised approaches."
METHODOLOGY,0.28291316526610644,"Next, we look at the right plot in Figure 5. We study the mutual information I(Z; T) and the
conditional entropy H(Z|T) between the unsupervised constructed clusters Z and the downstream
labels T. We select our method and PCL, providing the plot of the two information-theoretical
metrics versus the training epoch. We ﬁnd that, as the number of training epochs increases, both
methods can construct unsupervised clusters that are more relevant (higher I(Z; T)) and contain less
redundant information (lower H(Z|T)) about the downstream label. This result suggests that the
clustering-based self-supervised approaches are discovering the latent structures that are more useful
for the downstream tasks. It is worth noting that our method consistently has higher I(Z; T) and
lower H(Z|T) comparing to PCL."

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSIONS"
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSIONS,0.28851540616246496,"In this paper, we introduce the clustering InfoNCE (Cl-InfoNCE) objective that leverages the implied
data clustering information from auxiliary information or data itself for learning weakly-supervised
representations. Our method effectively brings the performance closer to the supervised learned rep-
resentations compared to the conventional self-supervised learning approaches, therefore improving
pretraining quality when limited information is at hand. In terms of limitation, our approach requires
clustering based on auxiliary information or data itself. This process sometimes could pose additional
computational cost. In addition, clustering on auxiliary information or data will also lose precision.
Tackling these problems would be our further research direction."

REFERENCES,0.4173669467787115,"We would like to point out that a concurrent work Zheng et al. (2021) presented a similar idea on
weakly-supervised contrastive learning in ICCV 2021. We would like to point out the reason it is a
concurrent work with ours. Zheng et al. (2021) is made publicly available on 10/05/2021, which is

The zero time overlap suggests that our two works are independent and concurrent."
REFERENCES,0.42016806722689076,"Similarity and Difference
We acknowledge that the two works share the similar idea of utilizing
weak labels of data in contrastive learning. Zheng et al. (2021) motivates by preventing class collision
during instance-wise contrastive learning (random data that belongs to the same category will possibly
get falsely pushed away in instance-wise contrastive learning), and ours motivates by exploring the
structural information of data within contrastive learning, followed by providing information-theoretic
analysis to explain how different structural information can affect the learned representations. Task-
wise Zheng et al. (2021) focuses on unsupervised (no access to data labels) and semi-supervised
(access to a few data labels) representation learning, and ours focuses on weakly supervised (access to
side information such as data attributes) and unsupervised representation learning. For the common
unsupervised representation learning part, Zheng et al. (2021) presents to generate weak labels using
connected components labeling process, and ours generates weak labels using K-means clustering."
REFERENCES,0.42296918767507,"Empirical Results
We observed that the performance on ImageNet-100 reported in [1] looks better
than ours (79.77 Zheng et al. (2021) v.s. ours 77.9 Figure 5). However, the experimental settings differ
a lot. First, the datasets are different despite the same name: Zheng et al. (2021) considers ImageNet-
100 by selecting the ﬁrst 100 class of the ILSVRC 2012 challenge, and we select a different set of 100
classes (details shown in the Appendix E). Second, the batch size is different: Zheng et al. (2021)
considers 2048 , and ours considers 128. Third, the projection heads in architecture are different:
Zheng et al. (2021) uses 2 projection heads (each with 4096 hidden units) with two objectives, one is
for InfoNCE and the other is for the proposed Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning loss; whereas
ours uses one projection head with 2048 hidden units for Cl-InfoNCE objective only. Although our
main experiments have demonstrated that Cl-InfoNCE alone can achieve competitive performance,
we acknowledge that adding InfoNCE objective with an additional linear projection head would
further improve the learned representation."

resnet50, same batch size of 384, same training epochs of 200, same projection head (2048-2048-128),
the same optimizer and linear evaluation protocols, etc. Our Kmeans cluster number K is chosen to be

EXPERIMENTS: COMPARISON WITH IDFD (TAO ET AL., 2021)"
REFERENCES,0.4481792717086835,"IDFD (Tao et al., 2021) presents to learn representations that are clustering friendly (from a spectral
clustering viewpoint) during the instance discrimination (ID) contrastive learning process. Although
it includes both ideas of clustering and contrastive learning, IDFD (Tao et al., 2021) differs from our
paper fundementally because they does not utilize the constructed clusters as weak labels to train
contrastive objective. However, IDFD (Tao et al., 2021) can still be considered as a self-supervised
representation learning method, hence we perform experiments to compare our unsupervised setting
(Cl-InfoNCE + Kmeans method) with their proposed IDFD on CIFAR10 Dataset (Krizhevsky et al.,
2009). To provide a fair comparison with IDFD (Tao et al., 2021), we stick to the training paradigm
of IDFD where they replaces Resnet-50 with Resnet-18. The batch size of 128 is used following
their report. Since IDFD (Tao et al., 2021) was focusing on clustering quality and didn’t report the
linear evaluation protocol, we use the released code of IDFD (Tao et al., 2021) to re-train the model
meanwhile using both the cluster accuracy and the linear evaluation protocal as evaluation metrics.
We train both methods for 1000 epochs for a fair comparison. The results are presented in Table 4."

node in the level l in the data’s WordNet tree hierarchy. l is the hyper-parameter2."
EPOCHS,0.49019607843137253,"Results.
Figure 6 presents our results. First, we look at the leftmost plot, and we have several
similar observations when having the data attributes as the auxiliary information. One of them is that
our approach consistently outperforms the auxiliary-information-determined clusters + cross-entropy
loss. Another of them is that the weakly supervised representations better close the gap with the
supervised representations. Second, as discussed in prior subsection, the WordNet data hierarchy
clusters can be regarded as the coarse labels of the data. Hence, when increasing the hierarchy
level l, we can observe the performance improvement (see the leftmost plot) and the increasing
mutual information I(Z; T) (see the middle plot) between the clusters Z and the labels T. Note that
H(Z|T) remains zero (see the rightmost plot) since the coarse labels (the intermediate nodes) can be
determined by the downstream labels (the leaf nodes) under the tree hierarchy structure. Third, we
discuss the conventional self-supervised setting with the special case when Z = instanced ID. Z as
the instance ID has the highest I(Z; T) (see the middle plot) but also the highest H(Z|T) (see the
rightmost plot). And we observe that the conventional self-supervised representations perform the
worse (see the leftmost plot). We conclude that, when using clustering-based representation learning
approaches, we shall not rely purely on the mutual information between the data clusters and the
downstream labels to determine the goodness of the learned representations. We shall also take the
redundant information in the clusters into account."

I(Z; T) and H(Z|T) with T being the downstream labels. There are 86 conﬁgurations of Z in total.
Note that the conﬁguration process has no access to data’s auxiliary information and among the
86 conﬁgurations we consider the special cases for the supervised

Z = T

and the unsupervised
setting

Z = instance ID

. In speciﬁc, when Z = T, I(Z; T) reaches its maximum at H(T) and
H(Z|T) reaches its minimum at 0; when Z = instance ID, both I(Z; T)

reaches their maximum. The code for generating these 86 conﬁgurations can
