ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0051813471502590676,"We argue that representations induced by self-supervised learning (SSL) methods
should both be expressive and learnable. To measure expressiveness, we propose
to use the Intrinsic Dimension (ID) of the dataset in representation space. Inspired
by the human study of Laina et al. (2020), we introduce Cluster Learnability (CL),
deﬁned in terms of the learning speed of a KNN classiﬁer trained to predict K-
means cluster labels for held-out representations. By collecting 30 state-of-art
checkpoints, both supervised and self-supervised, using different architectures, we
show that ID and CL can be combined to predict downstream classiﬁcation per-
formance better than the existing techniques based on contrastive losses or pretext
tasks, while having no requirements on data augmentation, model architecture or
human labels. To further demonstrate the utility of our framework, we propose
modifying DeepCluster (Caron et al., 2018) to improve the learnability of the rep-
resentations. Using our modiﬁcation, we are able to outperform DeepCluster on
both STL10 and ImageNet benchmarks. The performance of intermediate check-
points can also be well predicted under our framework, suggesting the possibility
of developing new SSL algorithms without labels."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.015544041450777202,"We consider the unsupervised learning scenario, which aims at learning distributed representa-
tions for complex natural data without human annotations. Despite great recent progress in self-
supervised learning (Chen et al., 2020a; Caron et al., 2021; Grill et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2020;
2018; He et al., 2020; Chen and He, 2021), the problem of properly evaluating the quality of the
learned representations has not been fully explored. We approach this question by drawing an anal-
ogy with the evolution of human language. Recent literature (Swarup and Gasser, 2008; Smith et al.,
2013) suggests that linguistic structure arises as a trade-off between expressiveness and learnability.
On one hand, expressiveness is the ability to discriminate objects and concepts of the world. On
the other hand, Kirby et al. (2014) states that language evolution undergoes an iterated learning pro-
cess, where each individual acquires language by observing a limited amount of language outputs
of others (Chomsky, 1980). This process induces a form of compression, which makes the language
simpler and more learnable for the next generation. Linguistic structure, e.g., compositionality,
emerges between these opposing forces."
INTRODUCTION,0.02072538860103627,"A similar guiding principle can be applied when learning representations of natural data. Many ex-
isting methods in self-supervised learning can be considered as attempts to increase expressiveness
of the representations, i.e., by maximizing or controlling the mutual information between inputs
and representations, either through reconstruction (Vincent et al., 2008; Higgins et al., 2017) or con-
trastive learning (Oord et al., 2018; Bachman et al., 2019b). We argue that in addition to maximizing
expressiveness, a good representation should also be learnable, e.g. support generalization from few
examples (Laina et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.025906735751295335,"In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for self-supervised learning relying on expres-
siveness and learnability. Compared with previous work (e.g., Wang and Isola, 2020), our framework
is independent of (i) the availability of downstream task labels or predeﬁned data augmentation tech-
niques, and (ii) architecture choices and dimensionality of the latent representations, which makes it
applicable to all previous SSL methods. We propose to measure expressiveness in terms estimators
of the intrinsic dimension (ID) of the data representations (Ansuini et al., 2019). Taking inspiration"

INTRODUCTION,0.03626943005181347,"from Laina et al. (2020), we quantify learnability in terms of the learning speed (in terms of number
of examples) of a KNN learner trained to predict the K-Means cluster labels for held out represen-
tations. We dub this method Cluster Learnability (CL). We show that high ID and CL correlate with
high downstream performance for 30 different pretrained checkpoints across different architectures."
INTRODUCTION,0.04145077720207254,"To further demonstrate the usefulness of our framework, we present a case-study in which we im-
prove upon DeepCluster (Caron et al., 2018), which is a self-supervised learning method that iterates
between clustering the representations and ﬁtting the cluster labels. Inspired by our CL measure, we
reﬁne the cluster labels by executing KNN at the end of each K-means clustering round. The result-
ing method, KNN-DeepCluster, is able to outperform DeepCluster in both ImageNet and STL10.
When visualizing the training trajectories on the CL-ID plane, we ﬁnd that our method indeed im-
proves learnability at convergence. The correlation between performance and learnability holds also
for checkpoints obtained during training, which suggests the possibility of using our framework to
guide the development of new SSL algorithm, without labels at hand."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.07253886010362694,"Representation Evaluation
Several recent works address the question of representation evalua-
tion in self-supervised learning. Whitney et al. (2021) propose to use the learning dynamic of the
downstream classiﬁers to measure the representation complexity, however the method depends on
extra human labels. Wang and Isola (2020) decompose the contrastive loss into an alignment loss
and a uniformity loss, which can be used to analyze the representation. However, their method
requires access to the projection head output, limiting their applicability to general architecture.
Pretext tasks like jigsaw, rotation prediction are shown to be well correlated with the supervised
evaluation (Reed et al., 2021; Deng and Zheng, 2021) or architecture search (Liu et al., 2020). How-
ever, as is shown in our experiments, they only provide limited predictive power when applying to
a large pretrained family of checkpoints including both supervised and self-supervised models. In
addition, these methods depends on predeﬁned data augmentation, which might be task speciﬁc."
RELATED WORK,0.07772020725388601,"Manifold Intrinsic Dimension
Intrinsic dimension can be thought of as the smallest number of
variable needed to approximate the representation manifold. Note that it is different from the intrin-
sic dimension of loss landscape (Li et al., 2018), which measures minimum dimension of parameter
space needed to optimize. We build upon extensive work on estimating intrinsic dimension. Apply-
ing local neighborhood information to estimate the intrinsic dimension is not a new idea, and it is
shown to be more superior to the global eigenvalue approach (Pettis et al., 1979b). Ansuini et al.
(2019) apply the TwoNN estimator (Facco et al., 2017) to the non-linear representation manifold of
modern deep neural nets. They ﬁnd that the intrinsic dimension is inversely correlated to the classi-
ﬁcation accuracy, and that the deep layers have smaller intrinsic dimensions. Their work is further
extended to conﬁrm that natural images lies in a low-dimension manifold (Pope et al., 2021), and
lower ID datasets leads to better generalization. Our work presents a more nuanced view about ID.
It suggests that in order to learning representation from scratch, a least amount of ID is needed to
convey the information from the dataset, e.g., a constant-value representation has an ID of 0, but no
capacity to generalize at all. More discussion can be found in Section 5."
RELATED WORK,0.08290155440414508,"Learnability, Ease-of-Transmission and Compression
Learnability has been argued to be a hall-
mark of the human language in order to be effortlessly transmitted through generations (Kirby et al.,
2014; Rafferty et al., 2011; Beckner et al., 2017; Zhou and Yurovsky, 2021; Kampen, 2004), and"

RELATED WORK,0.09326424870466321,"it is also true for visual concepts like color (Xu et al., 2010), categories (Grifﬁths et al., 2006),
shapes (Portelance et al., 2021) etc. In deep learning, it has been explored in the context of emergent
communication (Ren et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2019; Li and Bowling, 2019), language drift (Lu et al.,
2020), and neural module networks (Vani et al., 2021), but it is less explored for vision representa-
tion learning, except for a human study on just two SSL methods Laina et al. (2020). Learnability
has a tight connection to compression (Chaitin, 2007) and prequential codelength (Dawid, 1984),
which quantiﬁes the compression levels with the online learning error. Existing works (Blier and
Ollivier, 2018) has use it to support the generalization ability of the learner (e.g., deep neural nets)
on the dataset (e.g., labeled images). However, we use it to quantify the learnability of the repre-
sentation, in the sense that if the emerged Kmeans clustering is more learnable, then the same KNN
learner could achieve a lower compression bound via prequential coding."

expressive, we expect it to be able to represent images coming from more ﬁne-grained categories,
which could have multiple disentangled features such as color, shape, positions in space, etc. If these
disentangled features correspond to different directions in some non-linear manifold, ID should yield
a good surrogate for the expressiveness of the representation."

estimator (TwoNN) is shown to be reliable with respect to representation dimensions and scalable to
real-world datasets with deep neural networks (Ansuini et al., 2019). Assuming the data density is
approximately constant around data points up to the distance of their neighbors, this method exploits
the simple relationship between the distribution of the ratio of ﬁrst and second nearest neighbor
distances and the intrinsic dimension."

ROBUSTNESS ANALYSIS,0.43005181347150256,"In our experiments, we set the number of neighbors to be 3 in our KNNDeepCluster for both datasets,
and we ﬁnd that this does not affect our results much. We perform experiments on both STL-
10 and ImageNet. Our results are shown in Table 1. There are consistent gains on both STL10
and ImageNet, but the gain on ImageNet is smaller, and only appears with a weaker downstream
classiﬁer such as a KNN or with less training data."

10 (second row) for 400 epochs. Left: ID vs CL. Middle: Top-1 accuracy vs. ID. Right: Top-1
accuracy vs. Linear CL-ID predictor (from Section 4.3). Our proposed modiﬁcation makes the
representation more learnable at convergence without a signiﬁcant compromise of ID, leading to a
better solution. There is still a positive correlation between predictors obtained in Section 4.2 and
the performance, especially after models are warmed up (after epoch 8 in ImageNet and epoch 49 in
STL-10)."
ANALYSIS WITH THE CL-ID FRAMEWORK,0.44559585492227977,"We visualize the training trajectories in Figure 4. We observe that the training trajectories for both
methods follow similar general patterns across datasets: in the initial stage, the models tend to

ID hits the plateau and starts decreasing while CL keeps increasing. Despite the slight difference in
the ﬁnal stage between two datasets, we ﬁnd that KNN-DeepCluster converges to a solution that has
a higher CL in comparison to DeepCluster, without a signiﬁcant drop in ID."
ANALYSIS WITH THE CL-ID FRAMEWORK,0.46113989637305697,"We also ﬁnd that the relative Top-1 classiﬁcation performance of the intermediate checkpoints can
still be well predicted by our linear CL-ID predictor from Section 4.3, especially after the models
are property warmed up. The lack of correlation in the early stage checkpoints could be caused by
the fact that our linear CL-ID predictor is learnt from the collected 30 checkpoints, which are all
about late stage (with Top1 Acc greater than 50%)."
ANALYSIS WITH THE CL-ID FRAMEWORK,0.46632124352331605,"Previous work (e.g., Ansuini et al., 2019) claims that ID is inversely correlated to the Top-1 accuracy,
seemingly countering our expressiveness argument. Our ﬁndings are more nuanced. For ImageNet,
at least for the early and middle stages, the ID is increased (before epoch 119) so that, intuitively,
the model could explore as much as possible to encode the information from dataset. Then in the
later stage, a form of compression occurs while CL increases for better generalization – presumably
this stage is the regime of analysis done in Ansuini et al. (2019)."

CONCLUSION & DISCUSSION"
CONCLUSION & DISCUSSION,0.47668393782383417,"Inspired by an analogy with language emergencewe propose to analyze self-supervised representa-
tion learning through the lens of expressiveness and learnability. We propose to estimate expressive-
ness with TwoNN intrinsic dimension (ID), and learnability with the acquisition speed of a KNN
learner on the K-means clustering of the representation. Our large-scale evaluation with 30 check-
points supports our claim. Our method better predicts the top-1 accuracy than other evaluation
frameworks, while making less assumptions on data distributions, training algorithms or underlying
architectures. According to our method, we modify DeepCluster and our version outperforms it by
achieving better cluster learnability on both ImageNet and STL-10. Visualizations show that our
framework could predict the performance of the unseen intermediate checkpoints."
CONCLUSION & DISCUSSION,0.48186528497409326,"We believe our work is a solid step towards understanding the current SSL algorithms and opens up
interesting research directions. Future works could further explore the expressiveness-learnability in
a more theoretical context, extend this framework to other ﬁeld like pretrained language models, as
well as devise new SSL algorithms that directly maximize intrinsic dimension or cluster learnability."

With our new view on representation quality by expressiveness-

out to increase the expressiveness. Meanwhile, it aims to make the output vectors among positive
examples to be similar by which a higher value of learnability is ensured, since ideally the another
learner only need to see one example to generalize to other positive examples. As a result, the
degree of learnability here can be controlled by the deﬁnition of positive examples. A more diverse
selection of the positive examples should make the F leaning toward the learnability side, since each
example could represent a larger fraction of the inputs. It is well acknowledged in the self-supervised
community that a diverse data augmentation is an essential part of the contrastive learning, and under
this framework, it is a source of the learnability pressure."

Perhaps our expressiveness-learnability framework is more obvious
in the clustering-based algorithm like DeepCluster (Caron et al., 2018) and SwAV (Caron et al.,
2020). In these algorithms, you learn not only F but also a bank of cluster centroids C as well as
assignments ˜y = CT F(x). As a result, we can also view these algorithms as ﬁnding ˜y = G(x),
where G is composed of F and C."
REFERENCES,0.8393782383419689,"In these methods, the expressiveness is achieved by using a large number of clusters as well as some
uniformity constraint, and this can ensure each data has a distinctive cluster assignment. SwAV
achieves it with the SinkHorn iterations, while the DeepCluster, at least in the early version, would
balance the sampling ratio of images to make the cluster uniform as well as resolving the empty
cluster issues."
REFERENCES,0.844559585492228,"The learnability requirements are implicitly enforced as well. Since the space of ˜y is usually less
than x, there are usually multiple data being assigned to the same cluster. This already ensure that
a new learner should able to see a few examples to generalize within the cluster. In addition, these
algorithms also leverage the data augmentation, so that G(x) and G(x+) should have the same ˜y,

labels ˜yi from images xi. We also use ResNet18 as our student, train for 5 epochs, and report the
validation metrics as the learnability."
REFERENCES,0.9119170984455959,"The qualitative results can be found in Figure 5. We ﬁnd all these attempts does not produce any
meaningful signal. There many problems. Firstly estimating MI usng MINE is known to be sensi-
tive to many things like learning rate and architecture of MINE network (Tschannen et al., 2020).
Secondly the loss of directly mapping to the continuous vectors zi is heavily effected by dimension-
ality of the space. Thirdly, there is a architecture bias when we use ResNet18 as the students. ViT
checkpoints in general performs poorer since it is too different from the ResNets. As a result, our
proposed method CL and ID do not have these problem, mainly because we avoid training another
neural network from scratch."

labels with KNN predictions on STL10 with 512 clusters. Left: After Kmeans, each cluster has
unequal size, and the larger cluster are also well separated (low DB index). Middle and Right:
The originally well separated clusters gain size while the opposite ones lose size after KNN re-
assignment. The smallest DB index clusters are least effected by the re-assignment."
DEEPCLUSTER,0.9740932642487047,"We ﬁnd that after the initial K-means clustering there is an uneven distribution of cluster size, and
larger clusters have lower Davies–Bouldin index (DB Index)are more separable from the smaller
cluster. We ﬁnd the reassignment with KNN prediction would punish the smaller clusters with
larger DB index, and their cluster members are absorbed into large clusters. As a result, in the
next epoch, the network pays more attention on ﬁtting labels coming from large and well-separable
clusters"
