ABSTRACT,0.0,Abstract
ABSTRACT,0.0018315018315018315,"In this paper, Spectral Bridges, a novel clustering algorithm, is introduced. This algorithm
builds upon the traditional k-means and spectral clustering frameworks by subdividing data
into small Voronoï regions, which are subsequently merged according to a connectivity measure.
Drawing inspiration from Support Vector Machine’s margin concept, a non-parametric clustering
approach is proposed, building an affinity margin between each pair of Voronoï regions. This
approach is characterized by minimal hyperparameters and delineation of intricate, non-convex
cluster structures.
The numerical experiments underscore Spectral Bridges as a fast, robust, and versatile tool
for sophisticated clustering tasks spanning diverse domains. Its efficacy extends to large-scale
scenarios encompassing both real-world and synthetic datasets.
The Spectral Bridge algorithm is implemented both in Python (https://pypi.org/project/spect
ral-bridges) and R https://github.com/cambroise/spectral-bridges-Rpackage)."
