ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0014367816091954023,"Similarity-based clustering methods separate data into clusters according to the
pairwise similarity between the data, and the pairwise similarity is crucial for their
performance. In this paper, we propose Clustering by Discriminative Similarity
(CDS), a novel method which learns discriminative similarity for data clustering.
CDS learns an unsupervised similarity-based classifier from each data partition,
and searches for the optimal partition of the data by minimizing the generalization
error of the learnt classifiers associated with the data partitions. By generaliza-
tion analysis via Rademacher complexity, the generalization error bound for the
unsupervised similarity-based classifier is expressed as the sum of discriminative
similarity between the data from different classes. It is proved that the derived dis-
criminative similarity can also be induced by the integrated squared error bound
for kernel density classification. In order to evaluate the performance of the pro-
posed discriminative similarity, we propose a new clustering method using a ker-
nel as the similarity function, CDS via unsupervised kernel classification (CDSK),
with its effectiveness demonstrated by experimental results."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.004310344827586207,"Similarity-based clustering methods segment the data based on the similarity measure between the
data points, such as spectral clustering (Ng et al., 2001), pairwise clustering method (Shental et al.,
2003), K-means (Hartigan & Wong, 1979), and kernel K-means (Sch¨olkopf et al., 1998). The suc-
cess of similarity-based clustering highly depends on the underlying pairwise similarity over the
data, which in most cases are constructed empirically, e.g., by Gaussian kernel or the K-Nearest-
Neighbor (KNN) graph. In this paper, we model data clustering as a multiclass classification prob-
lem and seek for the data partition where the associated classifier, trained on cluster labels, can have
low generalization error. Therefore, it is natural to formulate data clustering problem as a problem
of training unsupervised classifiers: a classifier can be trained upon each candidate partition of the
data, and the quality of the data partition can be evaluated by the performance of the trained classi-
fier. Such classifier trained on a hypothetical labeling associated with a data partition is termed an
unsupervised classifier."
INTRODUCTION,0.005747126436781609,"We present Clustering by Discriminative Similarity (CDS), wherein discriminative similarity is de-
rived by the generalization error bound for an unsupervised similarity-based classifier. CDS is based
on a novel framework of discriminative clustering by unsupervised classification wherein an un-
supervised classifier is learnt from unlabeled data and the preferred hypothetical labeling should
minimize the generalization error bound for the learnt classifier. When the popular Support Vector
Machines (SVMs) is used in this framework, unsupervised SVM (Xu et al., 2004) can be deduced. In
this paper, a similarity-based classifier motivated by similarity learning (Balcan et al., 2008; Cortes
et al., 2013), is used as the unsupervised classifier. By generalization analysis via Rademacher com-
plexity, the generalization error bound for the unsupervised similarity-based classifier is expressed as
sum of pairwise similarity between the data from different classes. Such pairwise similarity, param-
eterized by the weights of the unsupervised similarity-based classifier, serves as the discriminative
similarity. The term “discriminative similarity” emphasizes the fact that the similarity is learnt so as"

CONTRIBUTIONS AND MAIN RESULTS"
CONTRIBUTIONS AND MAIN RESULTS,0.01293103448275862,"Firstly, we present Clustering by Discriminative Similarity (CDS) where discriminative similarity
is induced by the generalization error bound for unsupervised similarity-based classifier on unla-
beled data. The generalization bound for such similarity-based classifier is of independent interest,
which is among the few results of generalization bounds for classification using general similar-
ity functions (Section B.1 of Appendix). When the general similarity function is set to a Positive
Semi-Definite (PSD) kernel, the derived discriminative similarity between two data points xi,xj is
SK
ij = 2(αi+αj −λαiαj)K(xi −xj), where K can be an arbitrary PSD kernel and αi is the kernel
weight associated with xi. With theoretical and empirical study, we argue that SK
ij should be used
for data clustering instead of the conventional kernel similarity corresponding to uniform kernel
weights. In the case of binary classification, we prove that the derived discriminative similarity SK
ij
has the same form as the similarity induced by the integrated squared error bound for kernel density
classification (Section A of the appendix). Such connection suggests that there exists information-
theoretic measure which is implicitly equivalent to our CDS framework for unsupervised learning,
and our CDS framework is well grounded for learning similarity from unlabeled data."
CONTRIBUTIONS AND MAIN RESULTS,0.014367816091954023,"Secondly, based on our CDS model, we develop a clustering algorithm termed Clustering by Dis-
criminative Similarity via unsupervised Kernel classification (CDSK) in Section 5. CDSK uses a
PSD kernel as the similarity function, and outperforms competing clustering algorithms, including
nonparametric discriminative similarity based clustering methods and similarity graph based cluster-
ing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of CDSK. When the kernel weights {αi} are uniform,
CDSK is equivalent to kernel K-Means (Sch¨olkopf et al., 1998). CDSK is more flexible by learning
adaptive kernel weights associated with different data points."

CONNECTION TO RELATED WORKS"
CONNECTION TO RELATED WORKS,0.017241379310344827,"Our CDS model is related to a class of discriminative clustering methods which classify unlabeled
data by various measures on discriminative unsupervised classifiers, and the measures include gen-
eralization error (Xu et al., 2004) or the entropy of the posterior distribution of the label (Gomes
et al., 2010). Discriminative clustering methods (Xu et al., 2004) predict the labels of unlabeled
data by minimizing the generalization error bound for the unsupervised classifier with respect to
the hypothetical labeling. Unsupervised SVM is proposed in Xu et al. (2004) which learns a binary
classifier to partition unlabeled data with the maximum margin between different clusters. The the-
oretical properties of unsupervised SVM are further analyzed in Karnin et al. (2012). Kernel logistic
regression classifier is employed in Gomes et al. (2010), and it uses the entropy of the posterior dis-
tribution of the class label by the classifier to measure the quality of the hypothetical labeling. CDS
model performs discriminative clustering based on a novel unsupervised classification framework by
considering similarity-based or kernel classifiers which are important classification methods in the
supervised learning literature. In contrasts with kernel similarity with uniform weights, the induced
discriminative similarity with learnable weights enhances its capability to represent complex inter-
connection between data. The generalization analysis for CDS is primarily based on distribution free
Rademacher complexity. While Yang et al. (2014a) propose nonparametric discriminative similarity
for clustering, the nonparametric similarity requires probability density estimation which is difficult
for high-dimensional data, and the fixed nonparametric similarity is not adaptive to complicated data
distribution."
CONNECTION TO RELATED WORKS,0.01867816091954023,"The paper is organized as follows. We introduce the problem setup of Clustering by Discrimina-
tive Similarity in Section 3. We then derive the generalization error bound for the unsupervised
similarity-based classifier for CDS in Section 4 where the proposed discriminative similarity is in-
duced by the error bound. The application of CDS to data clustering is shown in Section 5. Through-
out this paper, the term kernel stands for the PSD kernel if no special notes are made."

"SIGNIFICANCE OF CDSK OVER EXISTING DISCRIMINATIVE AND
SIMILARITY-BASED CLUSTERING METHODS",0.022988505747126436,"Effective data similarity highly depends on the underlying probabilistic distribution and geometric
structure of the data, and these two characteristics leads to “data-driven” similarity, such as Zhu
et al. (2014); Bicego et al. (2021); Ng et al. (2001); Shental et al. (2003); Hartigan & Wong (1979);
Sch¨olkopf et al. (1998) and similarity based on geometric structure of the data, such as the subspace
structure (Sparse Subspace Clustering, or SSC in Elhamifar & Vidal (2013)). Note that the sparse
graph method, ℓ1-Graph (Yan & Wang, 2009), has the same formulation as SSC. Most existing clus-
tering methods based on data-driven or geometric structure-driven similarity suffer from a common
deficiency, that is, the similarity is not explicitly optimized for the purpose of separating underlying
clusters. In particular, the Random Forest-based similarity (Zhu et al., 2014; Bicego et al., 2021) is
extracted from features in decision trees. Previous works about subspace-based similarity (Yan &
Wang, 2009; Elhamifar & Vidal, 2013) try to make sure that only data points lying on or close to
the same subspace have nonzero similarity, so that data points from the same subspace can form a
cluster. However, it is not guaranteed that features in the decision trees are discriminative enough to
separate clusters, because the candidate data partition (or candidate cluster labels) do not participate
in the feature or similarity extraction process. Note that synthetically generated negative class are
suggested in Zhu et al. (2014); Bicego et al. (2021) to train unsupervised random forest, however, the
synthetic labels are not for the original data. Moreover, it is well known that the existing subspace
learning methods only obtain reliable subspace-based similarity with restrictive geometric assump-
tions on the data and the underlying subspaces, such as large principal angle between intersecting
subspaces (Soltanolkotabi & Candes, 2012; Elhamifar & Vidal, 2013)."

ments: (1) discriminative measure with information such as cluster partition is used to derive such
similarity so as to achieve compelling clustering performance; (2) it requires less restrictive assump-
tions on the geometric structure of the data than current geometric structure-based similarity learning
methods, such as subspace clustering (Yan & Wang, 2009; Elhamifar & Vidal, 2013)."
"SIGNIFICANCE OF CDSK OVER EXISTING DISCRIMINATIVE AND
SIMILARITY-BASED CLUSTERING METHODS",0.02586206896551724,"Significance.
The proposed discriminative similarity of this paper meets these two requirements.
First, the discriminative similarity is derived by the generalization error bound associated with candi-
date cluster labeling, and minimizing the objective function of our optimization problem for cluster-
ing renders a joint optimization of discriminative similarity and candidate cluster labeling in a way
such that the similarity-based classifier has small generalization error bound. Second, our framework
only assumes a mild classification model in Definition 3.1, which only requires an unknown joint
distribution over data and its labels. In this way, the restrictive geometric assumptions are avoided in
our method. Compared to the existing discriminative clustering methods, such as MMC (Xu et al.,
2004), BMMC (Chen et al., 2014), RIM (Gomes et al., 2010), and the other discriminative clustering
methods such as (Huang et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2017), the optimization problem of CDSK with
discriminative similarity-based formulation is much easier to solve and it enjoys convexity and effi-
ciency in each iteration of coordinate descent described in Algorithm 1. In particular, as mentioned
in Section D of the appendix, the first step (11) of each iteration can be solved by efficient SVD or
other randomized large-scale SVD methods, and the second step (12) of each iteration can be solved
by efficient SMO (Platt, 1998). Moreover, the optimization problems in these two steps are either
convex or having closed-form solution. In contrast, MMC requires expensive semidefinite program-
ming. RIM has to solve a nonconvex optimization problem and its formulation does not guarantee
that the trained multi-class kernelized logistic regression has low classification error on candidate
labeling, which explains why it has inferior performance compared to our method. The discrimina-
tive Extreme Learning Machine (Huang et al., 2015) trains ELM using labels produced by a simple
clustering method such as K-means, and the potentially poor cluster labels by the simple clustering
method can easily result in unsatisfactory performance of this method. The discriminative Bayesian
nonparametric clustering (Nguyen et al., 2017) and BMMC (Chen et al., 2014) require extra efforts
of sampling hidden variables and tuning hyperparameters to generate the desirable number of clus-
ters (or model selection), which could reduce the effect of discriminative measures used in these
Bayesian nonparametric methods."

PROBLEM SETUP,0.033045977011494254,"The discriminative clustering literature (Xu et al., 2004; Gomes et al., 2010) has demonstrated the
potential of multi-class classification for clustering problem. Inspired by the natural connection
between clustering and classification, we proposes the framework of Clustering by Unsupervised
Classification which models clustering problem as a multi-class classification problem. A classifier
is learnt from unlabeled data with a hypothetical labeling, which is associated with a candidate
partition of the unlabeled data. The optimal hypothetical labeling is supposed to be the one such that
its associated classifier has the minimum generalization error bound. To study the generalization
bound for the classifier learnt from hypothetical labeling, the concept of classification model is
needed. Given unlabeled data {xl}n
l=1, a classification model MY is constructed for any hypothetical
labeling Y = {yl}n
l=1 as follows.
Definition 3.1. The classification model corresponding to the hypothetical labeling Y = {yl}n
l=1 is
defined as MY = (S, F). S = {xl, yl}n
l=1 are the labeled data by the hypothetical labeling Y, and
S are assumed to be i.i.d. samples drawn from the some unknown joint distribution PXY , where
(X, Y ) is a random couple, X ∈X ⊆Rd represents the data in some compact domain X, and
Y ∈{1, 2, ..., c} is the class label of X, c is the number of classes. F is a classifier trained on S.
The generalization error of the classification model MY is defined as the generalization error of the
classifier F in MY."

alization error bound for the classification model. With f being different classifiers, different

the test data to the class such that the weighed average of the similarity between the test data and the
training data belonging to that class is maximized over all the classes. Inspired by this classification
method, we now consider using a general symmetric and continuous function S : X × X →[0, 1]

when S is a Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) kernel K, it can be verified that S−≡0, S = S+.
Remark 4.4. When the decomposition S = S+ −S−exists and S+, S−are PSD kernels, S is the
kernel of some Reproducing Kernel Kre˘ın Space (RKKS) (Mary, 2003). Ong et al. (2004) and Loosli
et al. (2016) analyzed the problem of learning SVM-style classifiers with indefinite kernels from the
Kre˘ın space. However, their work does not show when and how an indefinite and general similarity
function can have PSD decomposition, as well as the generalization analysis for the similarity-based
classifier using such general indefinite function as similarity measure. Our analysis deals with these
problems in Lemma 4.1 and Theorem 4.2. It should be emphasized that our generalization bound is
of independent interest in supervised learning, because it is among the few results of generalization
bounds using general similarity-based classifier. Section B.1 shows that the our bound is a principled
result with strong connection to established generalization error bound for Support Vector Machines
(SVMs) or Kernel Machines."

CONCLUSION
We propose a new clustering framework termed Clustering by Discriminative Similarity (CDS),
which searches for the optimal partition of data where the associated unsupervised classifier has
minimum generalization error bound. Under this framework, discriminative similarity is induced
by the generalization error bound for unsupervised similarity-based classifier, and CDS minimizes
discriminative similarity between different clusters. It is also proved that the discriminative similar-
ity can be induced from kernel density classification. Based on CDS, we propose a new clustering
method named CDSK (CDS via unsupervised kernel classification), and demonstrate its effective-
ness in data clustering."
