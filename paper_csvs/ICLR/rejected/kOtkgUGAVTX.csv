ABSTRACT,0.0029850746268656717,"We introduce Contrastive Intrinsic Control (CIC) - an algorithm for unsupervised
skill discovery that maximizes the mutual information between skills and state
transitions. In contrast to most prior approaches, CIC uses a decomposition of the
mutual information that explicitly incentivizes diverse behaviors by maximizing
state entropy. We derive a novel lower bound estimate for the mutual information
which combines a particle estimator for state entropy to generate diverse behaviors
and contrastive learning to distill these behaviors into distinct skills. We evaluate
our algorithm on the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark, which
consists of a long reward-free pre-training phase followed by a short adaptation
phase to downstream tasks with extrinsic rewards. We ﬁnd that CIC improves on
prior unsupervised skill discovery methods by 91% and the next-leading overall
exploration algorithm by 26% in terms of downstream task performance."

INTRODUCTION,0.011940298507462687,"Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful ap-
proach toward solving complex control tasks in the pres-
ence of extrinsic rewards. Successful applications include
playing video games from pixels
(Mnih et al., 2015),
mastering the game of Go (Silver et al., 2017; 2018),
robotic locomotion (Schulman et al., 2016; 2017; Peng
et al., 2018) and dexterous manipulation (Rajeswaran
et al., 2018; OpenAI, 2018; 2019) policies. While ef-
fective, the above advances produced agents that are un-
able to generalize to new downstream tasks beyond the
one they were trained to solve. Humans and animals on
the other hand are able to acquire skills without supervi-
sion and apply them efﬁciently to a variety of downstream
tasks. In this work, we seek to train agents that acquire
skills without supervision with generalization capabilities
by efﬁciently adapting these skills to downstream tasks."
INTRODUCTION,0.014925373134328358,"Over the last few years, unsupervised RL has emerged as
a promising framework for developing RL agents that can
generalize to new tasks. In the unsupervised RL setting,
agents are ﬁrst pre-trained with self-supervised intrinsic
rewards and then ﬁnetuned to downstream tasks with extrinsic rewards. Unsupervised RL algorithms
broadly fall into three categories - knowledge-based, data-based, and competence-based methods1.
Knowledge-based methods maximize the error or uncertainty of a predictive model (Pathak et al.,
2017; 2019; Burda et al., 2019b). Data-based methods maximize the entropy of the agent’s vis-
itation (Liu & Abbeel, 2021a; Yarats et al., 2021b). Competence-based methods learn skills that
generate diverse behaviors (Eysenbach et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2017). This work falls into the
latter category of competence-based methods."
INTRODUCTION,0.01791044776119403,"1These categories for exploration algorithms were introduced by Srinivas & Abbeel (2021) and inspired
by Oudeyer et al. (2007)."

INTRODUCTION,0.03582089552238806,"Figure 2: Qualitative visualizations of unsupervised skills discovered in Walker, Quadruped, and Jaco arm
environments. The Walker learns to balance and move, the Quadruped learns to ﬂip upright and walk, and the 6
DOF robotic arm learns how to move without locking. Unlike prior competence-based methods for continuous
control which evaluate on OpenAI Gym (e.g. Eysenbach et al. (2019)), which reset the environment when the
agent loses balance, CIC is able to learn skills in ﬁxed episode length environments which are much harder to
explore (see Appendix K)."
INTRODUCTION,0.03880597014925373,"Unlike knowledge-based and data-based algorithms, competence-based algorithms simultaneously
address both the exploration challenge as well as distilling the generated experience in the form of
reusable skills. This makes them particularly appealing, since the resulting skill-based policies (or
skills themselves) can be ﬁnetuned to efﬁciently solve downstream tasks. While there are many
self-supervised objectives that can be utilized, our work falls into a family of methods that learns
skills by maximizing the mutual information between visited states and latent skill vectors. Many
earlier works have investigated optimizing such objectives (Eysenbach et al., 2019; Gregor et al.,
2017; Kwon, 2021; Sharma et al., 2020). However, competence-based methods have been empiri-
cally challenging to train and have under-performed when compared to knowledge and data-based
methods (Laskin et al., 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.041791044776119404,"In this work, we take a closer look at the challenges of pre-training agents with competence-based
algorithms. We introduce Contrastive Intrinsic Control (CIC) – an exploration algorithm that uses
a new estimator for the mutual information objective. CIC combines particle estimation for state
entropy (Singh et al., 2003; Liu & Abbeel, 2021a) and noise contrastive estimation (Gutmann &
Hyv¨arinen, 2010) for the conditional entropy which enables it to both generate diverse behaviors
(exploration) and discriminate high-dimensional continuous skills (exploitation). To the best of our
knowledge, CIC is the ﬁrst exploration algorithm to utilize noise contrastive estimation to discrim-
inate between latent skill vectors. Empirically, we show that CIC adapts to downstream tasks more
efﬁciently than prior exploration approaches on the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Bench-
mark (URLB). CIC achieves 91% higher returns on downstream tasks than prior competence-based
algorithms and 26% higher returns than the next-best exploration algorithm overall."

BACKGROUND AND NOTATION"
BACKGROUND AND NOTATION,0.04776119402985075,"Markov Decision Process: We operate under the assumption that our system is described by
a Markov Decision Process (MDP) (Sutton & Barto, 2018).
An MDP consiss of the tuple
(S, A, P, r, γ) which has states s ∈S, actions a ∈A, transition dynamics p(s′|s, a) ∼P, a
reward function r, and a discount factor γ. In an MDP, at each timestep t, an agent observes the
current state s, selects an action from a policy a ∼π(·|s), and then observes the reward and next
state once it acts in the environment: r, s′ ∼env.step(a). Note that usually r refers to an extrinsic
reward. However, in this work we will ﬁrst be pre-training an agent with intrinsic rewards rint and
ﬁnetuning on extrinsic rewards rext."
BACKGROUND AND NOTATION,0.050746268656716415,"For convenience we also introduce the variable τ(s) which refers to any function of the states s. For
instance τ can be a single state, a pair of states, or a sequence depending on the algorithm. Our
method uses τ = (s, s′) to encourage diverse state transitions while other methods have different
speciﬁcations for τ. Importantly, τ does not denote a state-action trajectory, but is rather shorthand
for any function of the states encountered by the agent. In addition to the standard MDP notation,
we will also be learning skills z ∈Z and our policy will be skill-conditioned a ∼π(·|s, z)."

H(z) or H(τ), and ﬁnally (iv) how to estimate H(z|τ) or H(τ|z)."
MOTIVATION,0.07761194029850746,"3
MOTIVATION"
MOTIVATION,0.08059701492537313,"The results from the recent Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark (URLB) introduced
in Laskin et al. (2021), suggest that pre-training with competence-based approaches underperforms
relative to knowledge-based and data-based baselines on DeepMind Control (DMC). We argue that
the underlying issue with current competence-based algorithms when deployed on harder explo-
ration environments like DMC has to do with the currently used estimators for I(τ; z) rather than
the objective itself. To produce structured skills that lead to diverse behaviors, I(τ; z) estimators
must (i) explicitly encourage diverse behaviors and (ii) have the capacity to discriminate between
high-dimensional continuous skills. Current approaches do not satisfy both criteria."
MOTIVATION,0.08358208955223881,"Competence-base algorithms do not ensure diverse behaviors: Most of the best known competence-
based approaches (Eysenbach et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2017; Achiam et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019),
optimize the ﬁrst decomposition of the mutual information H(z) −H(z|τ). The issue with this
decomposition is that while it ensures diversity of skill vectors it does not ensure diverse behavior
from the policy, meaning max H(z) does not imply max H(τ). Of course, if H(z) −H(z|τ) is
maximized and the skill dimension is sufﬁciently large, then H(τ) will also be maximized implicitly.
Yet in practice, to learn an accurate discriminator q(z|τ), the above methods assume skill spaces
that are much smaller than the state space (see Table 1), and thus behavioral diversity may not be
guaranteed. In contrast, the decomposition I(τ; z) = H(τ) −H(τ|z) ensures diverse behaviors
through the entropy term H(τ). Methods that utilize this decomposition include Liu & Abbeel
(2021b); Sharma et al. (2020)."
MOTIVATION,0.08656716417910448,"Why it is important to utilize high-dimensional skills: Once a policy is capable of generating di-
verse behaviors, it is important that the discriminator can distill these behaviors into distinct skills.
If the set of behaviors outnumbers the set of skills, this will result in degenerate skills – when one
skill maps to multiple different behaviors. It is therefore important that the discriminator can ac-
commodate continuous skills of sufﬁciently high dimension. Empirically, the discriminators used in
prior work utilize only low-dimensional continuous skill vectors. DIAYN (Eysenbach et al., 2019)
utilized 16 dimensional skills, DADS (Sharma et al., 2020) utilizes continuous skills of dimension
2 −5, while APS (Liu & Abbeel, 2021b), an algorithm that utilizes successor features (Barreto
et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2020) for the discriminator, is only capable of learning continuous skills
with dimension 10. We show how small skill spaces can lead to ineffective exploration in a simple
gridworld setting in Appendix I and evidence that skill dimension affects performance in Fig. 6."
MOTIVATION,0.08955223880597014,"On the importance of benchmarks for evaluation: While prior competence-based approaches such
as DIAYN (Eysenbach et al., 2019) were evaluated on OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016), Gym
environment episodes terminate when the agent loses balance thereby leaking some aspects of ex-
trinsic signal to the exploration agent. On the other hand, DMC episodes have ﬁxed length. We show"

MOTIVATION,0.1044776119402985,"in Appendix K that this small difference in environments results in large performance differences.
In Fig. 11 we show that DIAYN is able to learn diverse skills in Gym but not in DMC, which is con-
sistent with both observations from DIAYN and URLB papers. Due to ﬁxed episode lengths, DMC
tasks are harder for reward-free exploration since agents must learn to balance without supervision."

more suitable for exploration due to the explicit presence of H(τ), which helps learning meaningful
representations and behaviors as evident in recent work (Campos et al., 2020; Mutti et al., 2021;
Liu & Abbeel, 2021a; Campos et al., 2021a; Yarats et al., 2021b) whereas Eq. 5 does not explicitly
encourage exploration. On the other hand, contrastive learning has been demonstrated as a powerful
approach for representation learning in vision and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2020; Oord
et al., 2018; Laskin et al., 2020b). It is therefore interesting to combine these two objectives into a
single intrinsic reward."

collected during this period to ﬁnetune the skill vector z. While it’s common to ﬁnetune skills with
Cross Entropy Adaptation (CMA), given our limited budget of 4k samples (only 4 episodes) we
ﬁnd that a simple grid sweep of skills over the interval [0, 1] produces the best results (see Fig. 6).
After this, we ﬁx the skill z and ﬁnetune the DDPG actor-critic parameters against the extrinsic
reward for the remaining 96k steps. Note that competence-based methods in URLB also ﬁnetune
their skills during the ﬁrst 4k ﬁnetuning steps ensuring a fair comparison between the methods. The

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.25970149253731345,"Figure 5: We visualize the contributions to the CIC intrinsic reward from the entropy and disciminator terms
across the three URLB domains. Since H(τ) and H(τ|z) terms are on different scales we set the hyperpa-
rameter α = 0.9 to weight the two terms equally for the Walker and Quadruped tasks. For Jaco, we ﬁnd that
discriminator-only CIC (α = 0.0) is sufﬁcient because random exploration results in meaningful behaviors
since the arm is ﬁxed to the table and therefore can’t fall. While the CPC intrinsic reward increases throughout
training, the entropy reward decreases and settles at a non-zero value. Without explicit entropy maximization,
the entropy of CIC approaches zero. Compared to APT, CIC achieves smaller entropy as expected since the
discriminator counteracts the entropy term. Compared to DIAYN, CIC achieves substantially higher entropy."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.2626865671641791,"form locomotion tasks while balancing. Quadruped is more challenging due to a higher-dimensional
state-action space and requires a quadruped to in a 3D environment to learn locomotion skills. Jaco
arm is a 6-DOF robotic arm with a three-ﬁnger gripper to move and manipulate objects without
locking. All three environments are challenging in the absence of an extrinsic reward."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.2656716417910448,"Baselines: We compare CIC to baselines across all three exploration categories. Knowledge-based
basedlines include ICM (Pathak et al., 2017), Disagreement (Pathak et al., 2019), and RND (Burda
et al., 2019b). Data-based baselines incude APT (Liu & Abbeel, 2021a) and ProtoRL (Yarats et al.,
2021b). Competence-based baselines include DIAYN Eysenbach et al. (2019), SMM Lee et al.
(2019), and APS (Liu & Abbeel, 2021b). The closest baselines to CIC are APT, which is similar
to CIC with α = 1.0 (no discriminator), and APS which uses the same decomposition of mutual
information as CIC and also uses a particle entropy estimate for H(τ). The main difference between
APS and CIC is that APS uses successor features while CIC uses a contrastive estimator for the
discriminator. For further details regarding baselines we refer the reader to Appendix C."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.26865671641791045,"Evaluation: We follow an identical evaluation to the 2M pre-training setup in URLB. First, we pre-
train each RL agent with the intrinsic rewards for 2M steps. Then, we ﬁnetune tune each agent to the
downstream task with extrinsic rewards in the data-efﬁcient regime of 100k steps. We use 10 seeds
across each downstream task for our method and all the baseline algorithms. For baselines, we
benchmark against leading knowledge-based, data-based, and competence-based approaches that
have been implemented in URLB. All baselines use the same DDPG optimization algorithm to
eliminate confounding factors when comparing algorithms."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.2716417910447761,"To ensure that our evaluation statistics are unbiased we use stratiﬁed bootstrap conﬁdence intervals
to report aggregate statistics across M runs with N seeds as described in Rliable (Agarwal et al.,
2021) to report statistics for our main results in Fig. 4. Our primary success metric is the interquartile
mean (IQM) and the Optimality Gap (OG). IQM discards the top and bottom 25% of runs and then
computes the mean. It is less susceptible to outliers than the mean and was shown to be the most
reliable statistic for reporting results for RL experiments in Agarwal et al. (2021). OG measures
how far a policy is from optimal (expert) performance. To deﬁne expert performance we use the
convention in URLB, which is the score achieved by a randomly initialized DDPG after 2M steps
of ﬁnetuning (20x more steps than our ﬁnetuning budget)."

RESULTS,0.33432835820895523,"Adaptation efﬁciency of CIC and exploration baslines: Expert normalized scores of CIC and
exploration algorithms from URLB are shown in Fig. 3. We ﬁnd that CIC substantially outperforms
prior competence-based algorithms (DIAYN, SMM, APS) achieving a 91% higher IQM than the
next best competence-based method (APS) and, more broadly, achieving a 26% higher IQM than
the next best overall baseline (ProtoRL). In further ablations, we ﬁnd that the contributing factors to
CIC’s performance are its ability to accommodate substantially larger continuous skill spaces than
prior competence-based methods."
RESULTS,0.3373134328358209,"Quantitative analysis of CIC behaviors: Quantitatively, intrinsic reward proﬁles during pre-
training and behavior entropies are shown in Fig 5. Since the CPC and etnropy terms are on different
scale, we pick a default hyparameter of α = 0.9 that puts them on equal footing. We ﬁnd that the
CPC intrinsic reward increases through training while the entropy term decreases to a non-zero
value. This is what we would expect to see as the discriminator distills behaviors into a set of skills
with lower than pure entropy maximization without skill learning. Using a particle estimator for
entropy, we ﬁnd that CIC behavioral entropy is less than APT and greater than DIAYN or CIC with-
out the entropy term. This suggests that the CIC agent has learned non-static skills while DIAYN
skills are mostly static. Finally, we ﬁnd that CIC with α = 0.0 (no entropy) on Jaco is optimal for
downstream task performance. This is most likely because, unlike Walker and Quadruped, which
require locomotion, Jaco tasks require reaching a certain position, so low-entropy skills that take the
end effector to a certain end position are favorable to skills that result in periodic motion."
RESULTS,0.3402985074626866,"For a qualitative analysis, we refer the reader to Fig. 2 and Appendix J."
RESULTS,0.34328358208955223,"Skill architecture and adaptation ablations: We ﬁnd that projecting the skill to a latent space be-
fore inputting it as the key for the contrastive loss is an important design decision (see Fig. 6a), most
likely because this reduces the diversity of the skill vector making the discriminator task simpler."
RESULTS,0.34626865671641793,"We also ﬁnd empirically that the skill dimension is an important hyperparameter and that larger
skills results in better zero-shot performance (see Fig. 6b), which empirically supports the hypoth-
esis posed in Section 3 and Appendix I that larger skill spaces are important for internalizing di-
verse behaviors. Interestingly, CIC zero-shot performance is poor in lower skill dimensions (e.g.
dim(z) < 10), suggesting that when dim(z) is small CIC likely performs no better than prior
competence-based methods such as DIAYN, and that scaling to larger skill dimensions enables CIC
to pre-train effectively."
RESULTS,0.3492537313432836,"To measure the effect of skill ﬁnetuning described in Section 5, we sweep mean skill values along
the interval of the uniform prior [0, 1] with a budget of 4k total environment interactions and read out
the performance on the downstream task. By sweeping, we mean simply iterating over the interval
[0, 1] with ﬁxed step size (e.g. v = 0, 0.1, . . . , 0.9, 1) and setting zi = v for all i. This is not an
optimal skill sampling strategy but works well due to the extremely limited number of samples for
skill selection."

in Fig. 6 indicate that skill selection affects downstream task performance. The most optimal skill
results in 8× better performance than the least optimal skill on Quadruped stand. Ablating the skill
dimension, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of the agent in Walker Walk with a ﬁxed skill
of 0 4 and ﬁnd that the zero-shot performance monotonically increases from skill dimension 4 until
reaching dimension 64 and starts decreasing for even higher skill dimensions."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.3611940298507463,"Supervised Reinforcement Learning: To date, most of RL research has focused on supervised
RL where training is supervised with an extrinsic reward function. Supervised RL has seen many
breakthroughs over the last ﬁve years (Mnih et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2017; Vinyals et al., 2019;
Silver et al., 2018; Berner et al., 2019; Andrychowicz et al., 2020; Schulman et al., 2016; 2017).
The ﬁeld has also produced several stable RL optimization algorithms that have helped accelerated
research Haarnoja et al. (2018); Hessel et al. (2018); Lillicrap et al. (2016); Schulman et al. (2017)."
RELATED WORK,0.3641791044776119,"Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning: The sub-ﬁeld of unsupervised RL consists of two primary
research areas - unsupervised behavioral learning and unsupervised representation learning (Srini-
vas & Abbeel, 2021). Unsupervised behavioral learning consists of learning behaviors and exploring
the environment without extrinsic rewards. Unsupervised representation learning consists of learn-
ing representations without supervision from high-dimensional data such as pixel observations. We
evaluate our method on the recently introduced Unsupervised RL Benchmark (URLB) (Laskin et al.,
2021), and focus solely on the behavioral aspect of unsupervised RL in order to isolate the core issue
preventing prior unsupervised skill discovery methods from exploring effectively on URLB."
RELATED WORK,0.36716417910447763,"Unsupervised Behavioral Learning: The aim of unsupervised behavioral learning is to produce
diverse behaviors that explore the environment without interacting with an extrinsic reward. Often
referred to as intrinsic motivation (Oudeyer et al., 2007), this is typically achieved by deﬁning an
intrinsic reward through a self-supervised task. Most behavioral learning algorithms fall into three
categories – knowledge-based (Pathak et al., 2017; 2019; Burda et al., 2019b;a) where the agent
maximizes the error or uncertainty of some predictive model, data-based (Campos et al., 2021b;
Liu & Abbeel, 2021a;b; Mutti et al., 2021; Seo et al., 2021; Yarats et al., 2021b) where the agent
maximizes data diversity, and competence-based Eysenbach et al. (2019); Hansen et al. (2020); Liu
& Abbeel (2021b); Sharma et al. (2020) where the agent maximizes the mutual information between
observable variables and a latent skill vector. We discuss the differences between CIC and the most
closely related competence-based exploration algorithms in Appendix D."
RELATED WORK,0.3701492537313433,"Unsupervised Representation Learning: Much progress in unsupervised representation learning
for RL has been spurred by unsupervised learning in computer vision (Chen et al., 2020; He et al.,
2020; H´enaff et al., 2020; Kingma & Welling, 2013) and language (Brown et al., 2020; Devlin et al.,
2019; Radford et al., 2019). In RL, the most common approach for representation learning has
been by adding it as an auxiliary loss in the supervised RL setting (Jaderberg et al., 2017). More
recently, a number of works have investiagted representaton learning with autoencoders (Yarats
et al., 2019; Hafner et al., 2019; 2020), siamese networks (Schwarzer et al., 2021a;b; Laskin et al.,
2020b; Stooke et al., 2021; Yarats et al., 2021b), and data augmentation (Laskin et al., 2020a; Yarats

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.3761194029850746,"We have introduced a new competence-based algorithm – Contrastive Intrinsic Control (CIC) –
which enables more effective exploration than prior unsupervised skill discovery algorithms by ex-
plicitly encouraging diverse behavior while distilling predictable behaviors into skills with a con-
trastive discriminator. We showed that CIC is the ﬁrst competence-based approach to achieve leading
performance on URLB. We hope that this encourages further research in unsupervised skill discov-
ery toward building more powerful exploration agents."
CONCLUSION,0.37910447761194027,"4The performance will, of course, be much better if we ﬁnetune the skill, but we cannot do so for zero-shot
evaluation."

RELATION TO PRIOR SKILL DISCOVERY METHODS"
REFERENCES,0.6746268656716418,"The most closely relatd prior algorithm to CIC is APS Liu & Abbeel (2021b). Both CIC and APS
use the H(τ) −H(τ|z) decomposition of the mutual information and both used a particle estima-
tor (Singh et al., 2003) to compute the state entropy as in Liu & Abbeel (2021a). The main difference
between CIC and APS is the discriminator. APS uses successor features as in Hansen et al. (2020)
for its discriminator while CIC uses a noise contrastive estimator. Unlike successor features, which
empirically only accommodate low-dimensional continuous skill spaces (see Table 1), the noise
contrastive discriminator is able to leverage higher continuous dimensional skill vectors."
REFERENCES,0.6776119402985075,"The CIC discriminator is similar to the one used in DISCERN (Warde-Farley et al., 2018), a goal-
condition unsupervised RL algorithm. Both methods use a contrastive discriminator by sampling
negatives and computing an inner product between queries and keys. The main differences are (i)
that DISCERN maximizes I(τ; g) where g are image goal embeddings while CIC maximizes I(τ; z)
where z are abstract skill vectors; (ii) DISCERN uses the DIAYN-style decomposition I(τ; g) =
H(g) −H(g|τ) while CIC decomposes through H(τ) −H(τ|z), and (iii) DISCERN discards the
H(g) term by sampling goals uniformly while CIC explicitly maximizes H(τ). While DISCERN
and CIC share similarities, DISCERN operates over image goals while CIC operates over abstrac
skill vectors so the two methods are not directly comparable."
REFERENCES,0.6805970149253732,"Finally, another similar algorithm to CIC is DADS (Sharma et al., 2020) which also decomposes
through H(τ)−H(τ|z). While CIC uses a contrastive density estimate for the discriminator, DADS
uses a maximum likelihood estimator similar to DIAYN. DADS maximizes I(s′|s, z) and estimates
entropy H(s′|s) by marginalizing over z such that H(s′|s) = −log P"

REFERENCES,0.6865671641791045,"i q(s′|s, zi))

HYPER-PARAMETERS"
REFERENCES,0.7134328358208956,"Baseline hyperparameters are taken from URLB Laskin et al. (2021), which were selected by per-
forming a grid sweep over tasks and picking the best performing set of hyperparameters. Similarly,
we also performed a grid sweep for CIC to pick the best performing set of hyperparameters. All
hyperparameters are the same across all domains except for α which is set to α = 0.9 for Walker
and Quadruped domains. Note that α = 0.9 results in equal weighing of the CPC and particle en-
tropy terms since their absolute values are on different scales. For Jaco, we found α = 0.0 to work
best, which means that only the discriminator contributes to the intrinsic reward. We hypothesize
that particle entropy maximization is not important for Jaco arm because it is ﬁxed and has no way
of falling over like Walker and Quadruped, such that meaningful behaviors can be learned with the
discriminator alone."

TOY EXAMPLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE NEED FOR LARGER SKILL SPACES"

agent in a 10 × 10 gridworld and provide the agent access to four discrete skills. We show that the mutual
information objective can be maximized by mapping these four skills to the nearest neighboring states resulting
in low behavioral diversity and exploring only four of the hundred available states."

in a 10 × 10 sized gridworld and that we have four discrete skills at our disposal. Now let τ = s
and consider how we may achieve maximal I(τ; z) in this setting. If we decompose I(τ; z) =
H(z) −H(z|τ) then we can achieve maximal H(z) by sampling the four skills uniformly z ∼p(z).
We can achieve H(z|τ) = 0 by mapping each skill to a distinct neighboring state of the agent. Thus,
our mutual information is maximized but as a result the agent only explores four out of the hundrend
available states in the gridworld."

maximizing H(τ) it is likely to visit a diverse set of states at ﬁrst. However, as soon as it learns an
accurate discriminator we will have H(τ|z) and again the skills can be mapped to neighboring states
to achieve minimal conditional entropy. As a result, the skill conditioned policy will only be able to
reach four out of the hundrend possible states in this gridworld. This argument is shown visually in
Fig. 8."

to a unique state which would result in the agent memorizing the environment by ﬁnding a one-to-
one mapping between states and skills. While this is a potential issue it has not been encountered
in practice yet since current competence-based methods support small skill spaces relative to the
observation space of the environment."

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF SKILLS"
REFERENCES,0.8298507462686567,"We provide two additional qualitative analyses of behaviors learned with the CIC algorithm. First,
we take a simple pointmass setting and set the skill dimension to 1 in order to ablate the skills learned
by the CIC agent in a simple setting. We sweep over different values of z and plot the behavioral
ﬂow vector ﬁeld (direction in which point mass moves) in Fig.9. We ﬁnd that the pointmass learns
skills that produce continuous motion and that the direction of the motion changes as a function of
the skill value. Near the origin the pointmass learns skills that span all directions, while near the
edges the point mass learns to avoid wall collisions. Qualitatively, many behaviors are periodic."

behavioral diversity and are not particularly useful for solving the downstream task. This observation

OPENAI GYM VS. DEEPMIND CONTROL: HOW EARLY TERMINATION
LEAKS EXTRINSIC SIGNAL"
REFERENCES,0.8537313432835821,"Prior work on unsupervised skill discovery for continuous control (Eysenbach et al., 2019; Sharma
et al., 2020) was evaluated on OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016) and showed diverse exploration
on Gym environments. However, Gym environment episodes terminate early when the agent loses
balance, thereby leaking information about the extrinsic task (e.g. balancing or moving). However,
DeepMind Control (DMC) episodes have a ﬁxed length of 1k steps. In DMC, exploration is therefore
harder since the agent needs to learn to balance without any extrinsic signal."
REFERENCES,0.8567164179104477,"To evaluate whether the difference in the two environments has impact on competence-based explo-
ration, we run DIAYN on the hopper environments from both Gym and DMC. We compare to ICM,
a popular exploration baseline, and a Fixed baseline where the agent receives an intrinsic reward
of 1 for each timestep and no algorithms receive extrinsic rewards. We then measure the extrinsic
reward, which loosely corresponds to the diversity of behaviors learned. Our results in Fig. 11 show
that indeed DIAYN is able to learn diverse behaviors in Gym but not in DMC while ICM is able to
learn diverse behaviors in both environments. Interestingly, the Fixed baseline achieves the highest
reward on the Gym environment by learning to stand and balance. These results further motivate us
to evaluate on URLB which is built on top of DMC."

higher extrinsic rewards than ICM on Gym, the Fixed intrinsic reward baseline performs best. However, on
DMC the Fixed and DIAYN agents achieve near-zero reward while ICM does not. This is consistent with

PSEUDOCODE FOR THE CONTRASTIVE DISCRIMINATOR IN CIC"

ON TIGHTER ESTIMATES OF MUTUAL INFORMATION"
"R E T U R N
L O S S",0.9850746268656716,"In this work we have presented CIC - a new competence-based algorithm that achieves leading
performance on URLB compared to prior unsupervised RL methods. We’ve shown that CIC results
in a tighter lower bound on mutual information than CPC by including the entropy term."
"R E T U R N
L O S S",0.9880597014925373,"One might wonder whether estimating the exact mutual information (MI) or maximizing the tightest
lower bound thereof is really the goal for unsupervised RL. In unsupervised representation learn-
ing, state-of-the-art methods like CPC and SimCLR maximize the lower bound of MI based on
Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE). However, as proven in CPC (Oord et al., 2018) and illustrated
in Poole et al. (2019) NCE is upper bounded by log N, meaning that the bound is loose when the MI
is larger than log N. Nevertheless, these methods have been repeatedly shown to excel in practice.
In Tschannen et al. (2020) the authors show that the effectiveness of NCE results from the inductive
bias in both the choice of feature extractor architectures and the parameterization of the employed
MI estimators."
"R E T U R N
L O S S",0.991044776119403,"We have a similar belief for unsupervised RL - that with the right parameterization and inductive
bias, the MI objective will facilitate behavior learning in unsupervised RL. This is why CIC lower
bounds MI with (i) the particle based entropy estimator to ensure explicit exploration and (ii) a con-
trastive conditional entropy estimator to leverage the power of contrastive learning to discriminate
skills. As demonstrated in our experiments, CIC outperforms prior methods, showing the effective-
ness of optimizing an intrinsic reward with the CIC MI estimator."

LIMITATIONS"
"R E T U R N
L O S S",0.9970149253731343,"While CIC achieves leading results on URLB, we would also like to address its limitations. First,
in this paper we only consider MDPs (and not partially observed MDPs) where the full state is
observable. We focus on MDPs because generating diverse behaviors in environments with large
state spaces has been the primary bottleneck for competence-based exploration. Combining CIC
with visual representation learning to scale this method to pixel-based inputs is a promising future
direction for research not considered in this work. Another limitation is that our adaptation strategy
to downstream tasks requires ﬁnetuning. Since we learn skills, it would be interesting to investigate
alternate ways of adapting that would enable zero-shot generalization such as learning generalized
reward functions during pre-training."
