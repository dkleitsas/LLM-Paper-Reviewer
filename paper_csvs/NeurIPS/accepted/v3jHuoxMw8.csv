ABSTRACT,0.0029069767441860465,"Vision-language navigation (VLN) requires an agent to execute actions following
human instructions. Existing VLN models are optimized through expert demon-
strations by supervised behavioural cloning or incorporating manual reward engi-
neering. While straightforward, these efforts overlook the accumulation of errors
in the Markov decision process, and struggle to match the distribution of the expert
policy. Going beyond this, we propose an Energy-based Navigation Policy (ENP)
to model the joint state-action distribution using an energy-based model. At each
step, low energy values correspond to the state-action pairs that the expert is most
likely to perform, and vice versa. Theoretically, the optimization objective is equiv-
alent to minimizing the forward divergence between the occupancy measure of the
expert and ours. Consequently, ENP learns to globally align with the expert policy
by maximizing the likelihood of the actions and modeling the dynamics of the
navigation states in a collaborative manner. With a variety of VLN architectures,
ENP achieves promising performances on R2R, REVERIE, RxR, and R2R-CE,
unleashing the power of existing VLN models."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.00872093023255814,"Vision-language navigation (VLN) [1] entails an embodied agent that executes a sequence of actions
to traverse complex environments based on natural language instructions. VLN is typically considered
as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) [2], where future states are determined
only by the current state and current action without explicit rewards. Therefore, the central challenge
for VLN is to learn an effective navigation policy. In this context, existing neural agents [1, 3, 4,
5, 6] are naturally constructed as data-driven policy networks by imitation learning (IL) [7] and
bootstrapping from expert demonstrations, i.e., ground-truth trajectories [1]."
INTRODUCTION,0.011627906976744186,"Most VLN models [1, 3, 8, 4, 5, 6] utilize behavioural cloning (BC), a classic approach for IL, through
supervised training. While conceptually simple, BC suffers seriously from quadratic accumulation
errors [9, 10] along the trajectory due to covariate shift, especially in partially observable settings.
Several efforts introduce ‘student-forcing’ [1, 11] and ‘pseudo interactive demonstrator’ [6], which
are essentially online versions of DAGGER [12], to alleviate this distribution mismatch. DAGGER
assumes interactive access to expert policies (i.e., the shortest path from current state to the goal2)
and reduces to linear expected errors [12, 10]. Some other studies [13, 3, 8, 4, 5] combine reinforce-
ment learning (RL) [14] and IL algorithms to mitigate the limitations of BC. Though effective, it
presents challenges in designing an optimal reward function [15] and demands careful manual reward
engineering. Such reward functions may not be robust to changes in the environment dynamics and"

2These approaches require a slightly more interactive setting than traditional imitation learning, allowing
the learner to query the expert at any navigation state during training. Previous studies [1, 6] have adopted this
setting, and this assume is feasible for many real-world imitation learning tasks [12]."

INTRODUCTION,0.05813953488372093,"struggle to generalize well across diverse scenes [16]. In addition, recent research [6] has revealed
that training transformer [17]-based VLN models using RL would introduce instability."
INTRODUCTION,0.061046511627906974,"From a probabilistic view, most VLN agents [1, 3, 4, 6] essentially train a discriminative action
classifier [8, 3, 4], and model the action distribution conditioned on current navigation state P(a|s)
at each time step (Fig. 1). This classifier is supervised by the cross-entropy loss to minimize 1-step
deviation error of single-step decision along trajectories [18]. However, the prediction of current
action affects future states during the global execution of the learned policy, potentially leading to
catastrophic failures [9, 12]. In other words, solely optimizing the conditional action probabilities
(i.e., policy) remains unclear for the underlying reasons of the expert behaviour, yet fails to exploit
complete information in the state-action distribution P(s, a) induced by the expert [14]."
INTRODUCTION,0.06395348837209303,"In light of this, we propose an Energy-based Navigation Policy (ENP) framework that addresses the
limitations of current policy learning in VLN from an energy perspective (Fig. 1). Energy-based
models (EBMs) [19] are flexible and capable of modeling expressive distributions, as they impose
minimal restrictions on the tractability of the normalizing constant (partition function) [20]. We
reinterpret the VLN model as an energy-based model to learn the expert policy from the expert
demonstrations. Specifically, ENP models the joint distribution of state-action pairs, i.e., P(s, a),
by energy function, and assigns low energy values to the state-action pairs that the expert mostly
performs. For optimization, this energy function is regarded as the unnormalized log-density of
joint distribution, which can be decomposed into the standard cross-entropy of action prediction
and marginal distribution of the states P(s). During training, ENP introduces persistent contrastive
divergence [21, 22] to estimate the expectation of P(s), and samples by Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics [23]. In this way, ENP simulates the expert by maximizing the likelihood of the action and
incorporates prior knowledge of VLN by optimizing state marginal distribution in a collaborative
manner, thereby leveraging the benefits of both energy-based and discriminative approaches."
INTRODUCTION,0.06686046511627906,"Theoretically, the training objective of ENP is to maximize the expected log-likelihood function over
the joint distribution P(s, a). This is equivalent to estimating the unnormalized probability density
(i.e., energy) of the expert’s occupancy measure [15, 24, 25]. Therefore, ENP performs prioritized
optimization for entire trajectories rather than the single-time step decisions in BC, and achieves a
global alignment with the expert policy. Furthermore, we realize that ENP is closely related to Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) [7, 26, 15]. For the optimized objective, ENP shares similarities with
IRL but minimizes the forward KL divergence [27, 28] between the occupancy measures."
INTRODUCTION,0.06976744186046512,"For thorough examination (§4), we explore ENP across several representative VLN architectures [3,
4, 6, 29]. Experimental results demonstrate that ENP outperforms the counterparts, e.g., 2% SR and
1% SPL gains over R2R [1], 1.22% RGS on REVERIE [30], 2% SR on R2R-CE [31], and 1.07%
NDTW on RxR-CE [32], respectively. ENP not only helps release the power of existing VLN models,
but also evidences the merits of energy-based approaches in the challenging VLN decision-making."

neural policy network within a sequence-to-sequence framework [34, 35] to predict action distribution."
RELATED WORK,0.07848837209302326,"As compressing all history into a hidden vector might be sub-optimal for state tracking across extended
trajectories, later attempts [36, 37, 6, 38] incorporate a memory buffer (e.g., topological graph) for
long-term planning. Recent efforts [39, 5, 4] are devoted to encode complete episode history of
navigation states and actions by transformer [17] and optimize the whole model in end-to-end training.
Later, various strategies have been proposed to improve the generalization of policies in both seen and
unseen environments [3, 8, 40, 41], such as progress estimation [42], instruction generation [33, 43, 44,
45, 46], backtracking [47], cross-modal matching [48, 49], self-supervised pre-training [50, 51, 52],
environmental augmentation [3, 53, 54, 55], visual landmarks [56, 57], exploration [58, 59], map
building [60, 61, 62, 63], waypoint prediction [64], and foundation models [65, 66]."
RELATED WORK,0.08139534883720931,"Policy Learning in VLN. VLN can be viewed as a POMDP [2], providing several expert demon-
strations sourced from ground-truth shortest-path trajectories [1, 30] or human demonstrations [32].
Behavioural cloning (BC) [67, 68], a typical approach of imitation learning (IL) [7, 15], is widely
used in current VLN agents [1, 33, 4, 6] with supervised policy learning. Nevertheless, it suffers from
distribution shifts between training and testing [12, 69]. [1] introduces ‘student-forcing’ [11] training
regime from sequence prediction to mitigate this limitation. Later agents [3, 8, 4, 5] combine both IL
and model-free RL [14, 70] for policy learning, where the reward function is manually designed on
the distance metric. Instead of directly mapping visual observations into actions or state-action values,
[13, 71] investigate model-based RL [72, 73] for look-ahead planning, exploring the potential future
states. As reward engineering requires careful manual tuning, [16] proposes to learn reward functions
from the expert distribution directly. Although RL is an effective approach in principle, DUET [6]
finds it difficult to train large-scale transformers with inaccurate and sparse RL rewards [74] in VLN.
Existing studies [61, 62, 63] use an interactive demonstrator (similar to DAGGER [12]) to generate
additional pseudo demonstrations and achieve promising performance."
RELATED WORK,0.08430232558139535,"In this paper, ENP learns to align with the expert policy by matching the joint state-action distri-
bution for entire trajectories from the occupancy measure view. Furthermore, ENP reinterprets the
optimization of policy into an energy-based model, representing an expressive probability distribution."
RELATED WORK,0.0872093023255814,"Energy-based Model. Energy-based models (EBMs) [19] are non-normalized probabilistic models
that represent data using a Boltzmann distribution. In EBMs, each sample is associated with an energy
value, where high-density regions correspond to lower energy [75]. A range of MCMC-based [76, 21]
and MCMC-free [77, 78] approaches can be adopted to estimate the gradient of the log-likelihood.
EBMs have been widely utilized in generation [22], perception [79], and policy learning [80, 81].
The most related work [25, 24, 22] will be discussed below. [25] employs EBM for distribution
matching, strictly prohibiting interaction with the environment. Moreover, this approach is applied in
an offline setting, specifically for healthcare. [24] considers the expert energy as the reward function
and leverages this reward for reinforcement learning. [22] adopts parameterized energy functions to
model the conditional action distribution, optimizing for actions that minimize the energy landscape."

demonstrations online. An external marginal state memory is introduced to store the historical
information for initializing the samples for next iterations. ENP demonstrates the potential of EBMs
in VLN decision-making, and improves the existing VLN agents across various frameworks."

a cross-modal state encoder Fθs and a conditional action classifier Fθa for action prediction. Hence
they are usually built as a composition of Fθs ⋄Fθa. There are different state representations in
previous work [51, 4], here we define a more general one. The cross-modal state encoder extracts
a joint state representation st = Fθs(x, Ot, Ht) ∈RKt×D by the visual embedding Ot, the
instruction embedding x, and history embedding Ht along the trajectory τ. Concretely, Ht comes
from recurrent hidden units of Seq2Seq framework or an external memory module (e.g., topological

trajectories {τ +} by interacting with the environments, and aggregate these trajectories as D+ =
{(x, τ)} ∪{(x, τ +)}. Then, the policy is updated by mixing iterative learning [12]. However, these
traditional approaches ignore the changes in distribution and train a policy that performs well under the
distribution of states encountered by the expert. When the agent navigates in the unseen environment
and receives different observations than expert demonstrations, it will lead to a compounding of
errors, as they provide no way to understand the underlying reasons for the expert behaviour [27]."

term. Both AIRL and ENP perform prioritized optimization for entire trajectories rather than the
single-time step decisions in BC, so the compounding error can be mitigated [15, 27]. As DKL is
a non-symmetric metric, the forward KL divergence results in distributions with a mode-covering
behaviour, while using the reverse KL results in mode-seeking behaviour [18]. In addition, ENP
directly models the joint distribution instead of recovering the reward function. We compare them in
the experiment (§4.3) and find ENP is more applicable to VLN (Table 8)."

Implementation Details"
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS,0.29069767441860467,"Network Architecture. ENP is a general framework that can be built upon existing VLN models. We
investigate ENP on several representative architectures, including: i) EnvDrop [3] adopts a Seq2Seq
model with a bidirectional LSTM-RNN and an attentive LSTM-RNN. ii) VLN⟳BERT [4] is built
upon multi-layer transformers with recurrent states. iii) DUET [6] is a dual-scale transformer-based
model with a topological map for global action space, enabling long-term decision-making. iv)
ETPNav [29] utilizes a transformer-based framework with an online topological map. For continuous
environments, both VLN⟳BERT [4] and ETPNav [29] employ a waypoint predictor [64]. Kt
dimension of the state representations st ∈RKt×D is different due to the local or global action spaces
of these methods. In §4, we follow the same settings of these models, replace their policy learning as
ENP, and maintain a Marginal State Memory M of 100 buffer-size."
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS,0.2936046511627907,"Training. For fairness, the hyper-parameters (e.g., batch size, optimizers, maximal iterations, learning
rates) of these models are kept the original setup. Back translation is employed to train EnvDrop [3].
The parameters of VLN⟳BERT [4] is initialized from PREVALENT [51]. The pre-training and
finetuning paradigm is used for DUET [6] and ETPNav [29]. For SGLD, ˆs0 is sampled from M with
a probability of 95% (Eq. 9). In EnvDrop [3] and VLN⟳BERT [4], the number of SGLD iterations is
set as I =15. Ipre =20 and Ift =5 of the pre-training and finetuning stages are used for DUET [6]
and ETPNav [29]. Although the step size ϵ and the Gaussian noise ξ in the original transition kernel
of SGLD are related by Var(ξ) = ϵ [23], most studies [22, 79] choose to set ϵ and ξ separately in
practice. The step size ϵ=1.5 and ξ ∼N(0, 0.01) are set in ENP (§4.3)."
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS,0.29651162790697677,"Inference. During the testing phase, the agent uses the learned Fθs for cross-modal state encoding,
and predicts the next step via Fθa, until it chooses [STOP] action or reaches the maximum step limit."

attribute this to the global expert policy matching, which promotes the path fidelity. This indicates
ENP enables the agent to make long-term plans, resulting in better NDTW and SDTW."

the joint distribution matching loss Lρ (Eq. 3) in
ENP, which is factored as the discriminative action
loss Lπ (Eq. 1) and the marginal state distribution
matching loss LS (Eq. 7). Both of Lπ and LS are
online optimized iteratively. A clear performance
drop is observed in Table 5, e.g., SR from 74% to 72% for DUET [6] on R2R, as only optimizing the
conditional action distribution with Lπ will degenerate into BC (or DAGGER) with cross-entropy
loss. This reveals the appealing effectiveness of the joint distribution matching strategy in ENP."

timize LS. Following recent EBM training, we
relax the restriction on the relation between the
step size ϵ and Gaussian noise ξ, i.e., Var(ξ) = ϵ.
Table 6 shows the results with different step sizes (when I = 15), and changing ϵ in a small range has
little effects on the performance. In addition, different noise variances Var(ξ) are also explored. Our
ENP is insensitive to parameter changes. We find that ϵ=1.5 and ξ ∼N(0, 0.01) for the transition
kernel of SGLD works well across a variety of datasets and frameworks in VLN."

DIAGNOSTIC EXPERIMENT,0.4127906976744186,"Number of SGLD Loop per Training Step. For
the SGLD sampler, we study the influence of the
number of inner loop iterations per training step.
In Table 7, we can find that I = 15 iterations
is enough to sample the recurrent states for En-
vDrop [3] and VLN⟳BERT [4]. Slightly more
iterations are required for the models [6, 29] with
additional topological graph memory due to the global action space. This can be mitigated by
pre-storing the samples in the Marginal State Memory M during pre-training. As these frame-
works [6, 29] employ pre-training and finetuning paradigm for VLN, we design a different number of
iterations, i.e., Ipre = 20 and Ift = 5. It is worth noting that the state memory Mpre can acquire the
samples while performing single-step action prediction in the VLN pre-training. Thus, the SGLD
iterations in finetuning based on Mft←Mpre can be further reduced."

alent to the forward KL divergence minimization, where
AIRL [27] makes use of the backward KL divergence. By modifying the original policy learning
in VLN⟳BERT [4] (a mixture of RL and IL) as an adversarial reward learning formulation, AIRL
achieves the comparable performance. ENP yields better scores on R2R-CE with 45% SR and 40%

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.43023255813953487,"In this paper, we propose ENP, an Energy-based Navigation Policy learning framework. By explicitly
modeling the joint state-action distribution using an energy-based model, ENP shows promise to solve
the intrinsic limitations of supervised behavioural cloning. Through maximizing the likelihood of the
action prediction and modeling the dynamics of the navigation states jointly, ENP learns to minimize
the divergence distance from the expert policy in a collaborative manner. Experimental results on
gold-standard VLN datasets in both discrete (R2R and REVERIE) and continuous environments
(R2R-CE and RxR-CE) demonstrate the superiority against existing methods. In the future, we will
explore more tasks and frameworks with the energy-based policy."

essential for robots to operate under specific security constraints. Therefore, further advancements
are necessary to ensure safe deployment in real-world dynamic environments."

the generalization of ENP to other architectures [63, 61] and more tasks [108] is not clear. We will
verify it in future work. ii) Efficiently sampling from un-normalized distributions for high-dimensional
data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Utilizing MCMC-free approaches [75, 109] and
neural implicit samplers [110] may offer valuable insights to enhance our approach. One limitation
of ENP is that the optimization through the SGLD inner loop at each training iteration (Algorithm 1),
which would reduce the training efficiency (about 9% delay for 5 SGLD iterations). In practice, ENP
balances performance and training time with a limited number of iterations. iii) In the future, agents

CLAIMS,0.813953488372093,1. Claims
CLAIMS,0.8168604651162791,"Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See §1. We include the paper’s contributions and scope in the abstract and
introduction.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8197674418604651,"• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.8226744186046512,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Appendix A.3, we discuss the limitations of the work.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8255813953488372,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs"
CLAIMS,0.8284883720930233,"Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]"
CLAIMS,0.8313953488372093,"Justification: In §3.2, we provide the details of our method.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8343023255813954,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility"
CLAIMS,0.8372093023255814,"Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Algorithm 1 and §3.4, we provide the implementation details of our method.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8401162790697675,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code"
CLAIMS,0.8430232558139535,"Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted."

EXPERIMENT STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE,0.8924418604651163,"• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text."

BROADER IMPACTS,0.9447674418604651,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations."
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9476744186046512,"• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9505813953488372,11. Safeguards
SAFEGUARDS,0.9534883720930233,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?"
SAFEGUARDS,0.9563953488372093,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.9593023255813954,Justification: Our paper is based on publicly available datasets and models.
SAFEGUARDS,0.9622093023255814,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9651162790697675,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
