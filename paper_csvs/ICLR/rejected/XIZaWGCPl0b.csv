ABSTRACT,0.0,"ABSTRACT
Federated
learning—multi-party,
distributed
learning
in
a
decentralized
environment—is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, more so than central-
ized learning. This is because malicious clients can collude and send in carefully
tailored model updates to make the global model inaccurate. This motivated the
development of Byzantine-resilient federated learning algorithms, such as Krum,
Bulyan, FABA, and FoolsGold. However, a recently developed untargeted model
poisoning attack showed that all prior defenses can be bypassed. The attack uses the
intuition that simply by changing the sign of the gradient updates that the optimizer
is computing, for a set of malicious clients, a model can be diverted from the optima
to increase the test error rate. In this work, we develop TESSERACT—a defense
against this directed deviation attack, a state-of-the-art model poisoning attack.
TESSERACT is based on our intuition that in federated learning, certain patterns of
gradient flips are indicative of an attack. This intuition is remarkably stable across
different learning algorithms, models, and datasets. TESSERACT assigns reputation
scores to the participating clients based on their behavior during the training phase
and then takes a weighted contribution of the clients. We show that TESSERACT
provides robustness against even a white-box version of the attack."

INTRODUCTION
Federated learning (FL) Smith et al. (2017); Yang et al. (2019) offers a way for multiple clients on
heterogeneous platforms to learn collaboratively without sharing their local data. The clients send
their local gradients to the parameter server that aggregates the gradients and updates the global model
for the local clients to download. FL can be attacked during the training phase by compromising a set
of clients that then send maliciously crafted gradients. The attack can be targeted against particular
data instances or can be untargeted. The latter brings down the overall accuracy by affecting all
classes. To counter this threat, a set of approaches has been developed for countering Byzantine
clients in FL, e.g., Krum Blanchard et al. (2017), Bulyan Mhamdi et al. (2018), Trimmed Mean and
Median Yin et al. (2018), FoolsGold Fung et al. (2020), and FABA Xia et al. (2019). In this work, we
use the state-of-the-art (SOTA) untargeted model poisoning attack called a directed deviation attack,
proposed recently in Fang et al. (2020). This has been shown to bypass all existing Byzantine-robust
aggregation techniques, e.g., Krum, Bulyan, Trimmed mean, and Median. In our experiments, this
attack has been found to decrease the test accuracy from 90% to a low 9% when a DNN is trained
using Krum on the MNIST dataset, distributed among 100 clients, 20 of which are under the attacker’s
control. We describe the relevant details of this attack in Section 2.2."
INTRODUCTION,0.0058823529411764705,"Our solution. We propose a novel defense called TESSERACT against untargeted model poisoning
attacks (Figure 1), which uses a stateful model to reduce the contributions by suspicious clients to the
global model update. We show that where all prior Byzantine-resilient federated learning approaches
fail against the directed-deviation attack of Fang et al. (2020), which is the state-of-the-art untargeted
model poisoning attack, TESSERACT is able to recover the test accuracy of the trained model. This
benefit applies even when the attack knows the algorithm and all the parameters of our defense, i.e.,
an adaptive white-box attack. TESSERACT is based on a simple intuition that for a sufficiently small
learning rate, as the model approaches an optima in a benign setting, a large number of gradients do
not flip their direction with large magnitudes, that is, a degree of inertia is maintained. Our intuition
is supported from the analysis we show in Figure 2. We capture this quantitatively in a metric that
we propose, called flip-score, which is the sum of squares of gradient magnitudes of all parameter
updates that suggest a flip in the gradient direction from the previous global update. We find that"

FLTrust Cao et al. (2020) and show that TESSERACT remains robust even against an adaptive
white-box attacker. While several of the existing defenses shine under specific configurations
(combination of attacks and datasets/models), TESSERACT is the only one whose protection trans-
fers well across configurations. We release the source code, the attack scripts, the trained models,

BACKGROUND
Our simulation of federated learning consists of m clients, each with its own local data, but with the
same model architecture and SGD optimizer, out of which c are malicious, as shown in Figure 1. The
parameter server assumes that a maximum of cmax number of clients can be malicious. The clients
run one local iteration, send their gradients (in unencrypted form) to the server, which updates the
global model for the clients to download in a synchronous manner.
2.1
BYZANTINE-RESILIENT FEDERATED LEARNING
Here we describe the leading defenses briefly, stymied by SOTA untargeted model poisoning attacks.
1. The simplest aggregation technique is FedSGD McMahan et al. (2017) that does a simple weighted
mean aggregation of the gradients, weighted by the number of data samples each client holds.
FedSGD can be attacked by a single malicious client that can send boosted gradients.
2. Trimmed mean and Median Yin et al. (2018) aggregate the parameters independently, where
one trims cmax each at the lower and higher extremes of every parameter and the other takes the
median of every parameter update across the gradients received from all the clients. The full-Trim
attack Fang et al. (2020) is specifically designed toward these aggregations rules.
3. Krum Blanchard et al. (2017) selects one local model as the next global model. The client that has
the lowest Euclidean distance from its closest (m −cmax −2) neighbors is chosen as the local
model. The full-Krum attack Fang et al. (2020) is tailored to attack Krum.
4. Bulyan Mhamdi et al. (2018) combines the above approaches by running Krum iteratively to select
a given number of models, and then running Trimmed Mean over the selected ones. The Full-Trim
attack is also transferable to Bulyan.
5. FABA Xia et al. (2019) iteratively filters out models farthest away from the mean of the remaining
models, cmax number of times before returning the mean of the remaining gradients.
6. FoolsGold Fung et al. (2020) was motivated to defend against poisoning attacks by Sybil clones,
and thus, it finds clients with similar cosine similarity to be malicious, penalizes their reputation,
and returns a weighted mean of the gradients, weighed by their reputation.
7. FLTrust Cao et al. (2020) bootstraps trust in the clients by assuming that the server has access to a
clean validation dataset, albeit small, and returns a weighted mean of the gradients weighed by this
trust. In our setting, we do not see a realistic method to access such as clean dataset, especially
considering the non-iid nature of the local datasets at the clients."

BACKGROUND,0.03823529411764706,"Our threat model consists of a scenario where an adversary compromises a fraction of all clients
participating in federated learning. We assume that the adversary also has access to the gradient vector
sent by the benign clients to the server, and knows what aggregation algorithm the server is running.

BACKGROUND,0.047058823529411764,"§ A.6.2), we have also evaluated TESSERACT on label-flipping attacks in Appendix § A.3. The DDA
changes the local models on the compromised worker devices. This change is done strategically
(through solving a constrained optimization problem) such that the global model deviates the most
toward the inverse of the direction along which the benign global model would have changed. Their
intuition is that the deviations accumulated over multiple iterations would make the learned global
model differ from the benign one significantly."
BACKGROUND,0.05,"TESSERACT defends against both variants of the DDA, one specialized to poison Krum (transferable
to Bulyan, we call this the Full-Krum attack), the other specialized for Trimmed Mean (transferable
to Median, we call this the Full-Trim attack), respectively. We assume a full-knowledge (white-box)
attack where the attackers have access to the current benign gradients. They themselves compute the
benign gradients on their local data as well, and thus estimate the benign direction as the average of all
benign gradients. This value is stored in a vector s of size equal to the number of model parameters."

BACKGROUND,0.058823529411764705,"Full-Krum attack: Having estimated s, the attackers send gradients in the opposite direction, all
with a magnitude λ, with some added noise to appear different but still maintaining a small Euclidean
distance from one another. The upper bound of λ is computed in every iteration as a function of
m, c, |P|, GM(t, ·), ▽LMi(t + 1, ·), where c out m participating clients are malicious, |P| is the
number of parameters in the global model GM. λ is then iteratively decreased until the attackers
make sure (using a local estimate) that the parameter server would have chosen the attacked model,
using the Krum aggregation technique."
BACKGROUND,0.061764705882352944,"Full-Trim attack: The Trim attack while following the same fundamental principle of flipping the
gradient direction, attempts to skew the distribution of every parameter j toward the inverse of the
direction that s(t, j) suggests in order to attack a mean-like aggregation. It does so by randomly
sampling gradient magnitudes from a range that has been computed by the attackers, guaranteed to
skew the gradient distribution of every parameter, without appearing as obvious outliers (which would
be caught by a method such as Trimmed Mean). Therefore, the attacked gradients here look more
diverse than those in the Full-Krum attack. Overall, both forms of the DDA smartly take advantage
of the fact that none of the existing aggregation techniques looks at the change in gradient direction
to identify malicious gradients in a robust way."

DESIGN
TESSERACT uses a reputation-based scheme to compute the aggregation weights of the participating
clients. Reputation-based schemes have been widely used in the literature. For example, Kang et al.
(2019) and Zhang et al. (2012) make use of reputation score as an incentive mechanism for clients to
remain in the system. Fung et al. (2020) and Awan et al. (2021) compute reputation score from the
pairwise cosine similarity of the gradients between clients, Cao et al. (2021) does that by computing
the cosine similarity of the client gradients with reference to trusted gradients calculated on a clean
validation dataset at the server. We compute reputation-score in a different way by using flip-score of
the local gradients, as described below. TESSERACT assumes that a maximum of cmax(< m"

µd < 1, for more details, see Appendix § A.1). We normalize the reputation score using softmax to
do a weighted mean aggregation, but a user can use this to directly filter out the suspicious gradients
and use an aggregation rule of one’s choice. We halve the reputation score of every client if any of
the values grows so large that the softmax operation causes an overflow. This is motivated by the fact
that the reputation score is a cumulative quantity, and can potentially keep increasing with time in an

that the gradient updates are approximately in the same direction as the previous iteration. In contrast,
a high flip-score suggests a deviation from the previous update. This could mean either a large
number of parameters have flipped direction, or a small number of parameters have flipped direction
with large magnitudes, or both. As observed in Figure 2, if the previous global update was benign,
a malicious client will tend to have a high flip-score. However, if the previous update itself was
poisoned, the flip-score of benign clients will be high and those of malicious clients will be low.
Therefore, we penalize cmax number of clients at either end of the current flip-score distribution,
as also done by Yin et al. (2018), but we do this in the context of gradient values per parameter.
This allows our system to have a higher detection coverage irrespective of whether the global model
was poisoned in one iteration or not. Since we allow redemption, and make sure that in a random
penalization scheme, the expectation of reputation score of a benign node approaches zero, we do
not unnecessarily penalize benign clients with low flip-scores. Also, since we do not use any hard
threshold for detecting attacks, and identify only the extreme ends of flip-score distribution in every
iteration as malicious, we do not prevent low flip-score moves. At the time of convergence, when
most of the clients will favor low flip-score moves, such moves will be allowed even after ignoring
the gradients at the extreme ends."

We have simulated the federated learning on a single machine with a Tesla P100 PCIe GPU with
16GB memory, using PyTorch, with as many clients as can be handled by our machine. The data was
distributed with a non-IID bias of 0.5 (default), except for Shakespeare where the data was distributed
sequentially among the clients and FEMNIST where the data was distributed by the writer. In our
simulation, all clients run one local iteration on a batch of its local data before communicating with
the parameter server in a synchronous manner. The clients sample their local data in a round-robin
manner, send their local gradients to the parameter server, and download the updated global model
before running the next local iteration. The malicious clients attack every iteration of training, we
assume: c = cmax."

or 2nd place finisher in 7 of the 12 cells (benign + two attacks × 4 datasets). This on the surface
appears to be not very promising, till one looks deeper. The baseline protocols that finish first in one
configuration fare disastrously in other configurations, indicating that they are tailored to specific
attacks or datasets (whether by conscious design or as an artifact of their design). For example,
FoolsGold does creditably for the Full-Trim attack but is vulnerable against the Full-Krum attack.
Averaging across the configurations, it appears FABA is the closest competitor to TESSERACT. We
observe that FABA, although it performed well for c/m = 0.2, failed to defend when the number
of attackers grew to c/m = 0.3, evident from the results in Figure 3(b). We have used F-MNIST,
Ch-MNIST, and Breast cancer Wisconsin Dataset here to show the effect on diverse datasets. As the
number of attackers increases, the mean starts to shift more toward them. One false positive detection
by FABA can cause it to trim out a benign local update, which causes the mean to shift further toward
the malicious updates iteratively, and fail. On the other hand, TESSERACT is guaranteed to defend
against the attack as long as c ≤cmax and c < m"

penalize many benign clients and assign them a zero weight in order to conservatively defend against
an attack, as can be seen in Table 3. This can have a significantly negative impact on a practical
system where one wishes to learn from data that the different clients hold locally. On the other
hand, TESSERACT allows all clients to contribute to the global model update that do not have a large
negative reputation score. Figure 4 shows the evolution of the average reputation score of malicious

malicious clients decrease with time tending to zero, while those of the benign clients increase with

ADAPTIVE ATTACK,0.21470588235294116,"6.2
ADAPTIVE ATTACK
Having shown the performance of TESSERACT against the above attacks, we proceed to analyze an
adaptive attack scenario, i.e., one where the attacker has full knowledge of TESSERACT, including
the dynamic value of the cutoff flip-scores. Thus, at iteration t + 1, the attacker knows FSlow(t) and
FShigh(t) beyond which the clients were penalized at iteration t. The Adaptive-Krum attack first
computes the target malicious gradients at t+1, and if its flip-score goes above FShigh(t), it reverses
the attack on its less important parameters, i.e., parameters that would have had low magnitude
updates without attack. It does this by replacing 5% of the attacked parameters, at a time, with their
benign values until the flip-score is brought down to ensure stealth. Since the stealthy attack will be
less powerful than the original intended attack, the global model will only be partially poisoned, and
the attackers are not expected to occupy the lower spectrum of the flip-score. This has been verified"
ADAPTIVE ATTACK,0.21764705882352942,Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
ADAPTIVE ATTACK,0.22058823529411764,"Figure 5: Performance of TESSERACT against adaptive white-box attacks, specifically designed to attack
TESSERACT, evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We observe a significant improvement in test accuracy,

ADAPTIVE ATTACK,0.2235294117647059,"in our experiments as well. All the malicious clients send these attacked parameters with some added
randomness in order to support one other. We observe a trade-off between stealth and attack impact
in this case, as can be seen in Figure 5."
ADAPTIVE ATTACK,0.22647058823529412,"The Adaptive-Trim attack is a smarter and collaborative attack. Its target is to generate attacked
gradients vi, i = 0, 1, 2, · · · c −1. It first computes the Full-Trim target attack ui for every malicious
client i. Then, it initializes v0 to u0 and modifies it, until v0 generates a flip-score that is less than
FShigh(t). Client i = 1 then updates its target attack from u1 to v1 = u1 + (u0 −v0) in order to
compensate for a sub-optimal attack created by i = 0 because of the flip-score-evasion constraint.
Thus, a client may not necessarily find a solution if the target grows and the constraints are hard to
solve for. The attacker hopes that Pc−1
i=0 ui = Pc−1
i=0 vi. The performance of TESSERACT against
this adaptive white-box attack is shown in Figure 5. We find that the adaptive attacks are not very
effective against TESSERACT. The benign accuracy for the two datasets are 92.45% and 71.17%.
This happens due to multiple reasons: 1) the attack loses in strength while trying to gain in stealth,
2) the attackers need not be allotted equal reputation weights, so the weighted sum of the attacked
gradients v do not match with the weighted sum of the target attack u, 3) the flip-score distribution
is dynamic, as can be seen in Figure 2, and changes from time t to t + 1, and when it decreases in
consecutive iterations by a significant amount, the attackers can still be blocked."
ADAPTIVE ATTACK,0.22941176470588234,"We have also created a more knowledgeable attacker, by modifying the above constraint with a
weighted sum, weighted by the reputation scores. We have evaluated this attack in Figure 8 in
Appendix § A.3. TESSERACT is effective against this attack too, for reasons (1) and (3) given above."

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION"
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION,0.23529411764705882,"We have presented TESSERACT, a secure parameter server for federated learning robust to model poi-
soning attacks. TESSERACT uses a stateful algorithm to allocate reputation scores to the participating
clients to lower the contribution of maliciously behaving clients. We define malicious behavior using
a metric, flip-score, which when very high or low, captures attacks that try to divert the global model
away from convergence. This makes TESSERACT a robust defense, no matter when it is instantiated,
although we recommend enabling TESSERACT right from the start. TESSERACT can also be used
to just filter out clients based on their reputation, so that an aggregation of the user’s choice can be
used. We evaluate the benefits of TESSERACT compared to the fundamental FL aggregation FedSGD
and state-of-the-art defenses, namely Krum, Bulyan, FABA, FoolsGold, and FLTrust. We evaluate
using full knowledge untargeted model poisoning attacks that have recently been found to be most
damaging against FL. We find that different existing defenses shine under specific combinations of
attacks and datasets/models. However, TESSERACT provides transferable defense with accuracy
competitive with individual winners under all configurations. Further, TESSERACT holds up better
than its closest competitor, FABA, when the fraction of malicious clients increases (beyond 20%).
Finally, an adaptive white-box attacker with access to all internals of TESSERACT, including dynami-
cally determined threshold parameters, cannot bypass its defense. All of our evaluation is limited
to a synchronous setting with no gradient encryption, as gradient encryption is less relevant in a"

first by subjecting it to a higher number of malicious clients to find the breaking point of TESSERACT,

of compromised clients is still not greater than cmax, and to that end, we set c = cmax. Since

CONCRETE USE-CASE"
V,0.9794117647058823,"A typical use-case would be a cross-device or a cross-silo setting where a critical model is being
learned, such as, mapping to a battlefield scenario by integrating sensor data from multiple sensors or
a smart farms scenario to integrate data from multiple sensor nodes."
V,0.9823529411764705,"In a sensitive setting, there could be malicious intent to degrade the training process. Here an attacker
could either compromise participating devices or join the training under multiple aliases. Having
joined the network, it could intercept the communication between benign clients and the server, or
directly compromise the server to get access to the benign gradients in order to craft the malicious
gradients. This constitutes a full-knowledge attack. Further, prior work has shown that even the
partial knowledge attack can be quite damaging (in such an attack, the adversary does not need
to know the gradients of the benign clients, but assumes its own before-attack gradients to be an
approximate estimate of the benign gradients). With an approximate estimate of the benign gradients,
it is easy for an adversary to launch the directed-deviation attack to start pushing the global model
away from the optima until the goal of “denial-of-service” is achieved."

GENERALIZABILITY OF THE DEFENSE"
V,0.9911764705882353,"We have demonstrated that TESSERACT achieves the goal of secure aggregation in the presence
of directed-deviation attacks, their adaptive-white-box versions, as well targeted and untargeted
label-flipping attacks. This is because the fundamental intuition behind TESSERACT is based on
the assumption that a large flip-score is indicative of an attack. It should be noted that the primary
objective of any untargeted model poisoning attack is to push the global model away from the optima.
Given the currently aggregated global model is benign, an attack will invariably push the model
parameters in the opposite direction as the benign gradients, and would consequently generate a large
flip-score and get flagged. If the current global model itself had a poisoned iteration, the attacked
gradients will support the current direction in which the model was moving, and would generate low
flip-scores while the benign gradients now would generate high values of flip-score, as demonstrated
in Figure 2. Since, we trim out both the ends of the flip-score spectrum in a relative manner, we
provide a mechanism to defend against any untargeted attack."

ACCURACY OF BASELINE FEDSGD MODEL"
V,0.9970588235294118,"As in other federated learning-related security papers Fang et al. (2020); Fung et al. (2020); Bag-
dasaryan et al. (2020), our goal was not necessarily to achieve the smallest error rates for the protocols
on the considered datasets as our goal was not to search for the most optimized DNN architecture.
Instead, our goal was to demonstrate that the state-of-the-art attacks can increase the testing error
rates of the learned DNN classifiers and TESSERACT can reverse the attacks better than the other
defense algorithms. Since all baselines and our solution are evaluated on top of the same trained
model, therefore we have a valid comparison base. Of course, we want DNNs to be reasonably
performant as ours are."
