We show that the original GCG [35] is not sufficient for jailbreak, as the model may generate the
first few target tokens, but may still fail to fulfill the request. In contrast, our method, AttnGCG,
successfully bypasses the safety protocols rooted in LLMs by increasing the attention score on the

46"
INTRODUCTION,0.06574761399787911,"which reveals where the model focuses during token generation, in achieving successful jailbreaking.
47"
INTRODUCTION,0.06680805938494168,"Specifically, in aligned LLMs, the input typically consists of two parts: a system prompt (though,
48"
INTRODUCTION,0.06786850477200425,"for some LLMs, defaulted to be empty) and a user prompt, assuming a zero-shot scenario. In the
49"
INTRODUCTION,0.0689289501590668,"jailbreaking context, the user prompt can be further segmented into the goal prompt, representing
50"

52"

53"
INTRODUCTION,0.07317073170731707,"model’s attention score on the adversarial suffix could serve as a strong indicator of the jailbreaking
54"
INTRODUCTION,0.07423117709437964,"performance, e.g., a successful jailbreak typically corresponds with a high attention score on the
55"
INTRODUCTION,0.07529162248144221,"adversarial suffix. The rationale behind this is that as the attention score on the adversarial suffix
56"
