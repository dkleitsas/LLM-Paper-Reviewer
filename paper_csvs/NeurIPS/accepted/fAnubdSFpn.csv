ABSTRACT,0.0,Abstract
ABSTRACT,0.0038314176245210726,"Modern deep learning models often exhibit overconfident predictions, inadequately
capturing uncertainty. During model optimization, the expected calibration error
tends to overfit earlier than classification accuracy, indicating distinct optimiza-
tion objectives for classification error and calibration error. To ensure consistent
optimization of both model accuracy and model calibration, we propose a novel
method incorporating a probability-dependent gradient decay coefficient into loss
function. This coefficient exhibits a strong correlation with the overall confidence
level. To maintain model calibration during optimization, we utilize a proportional-
integral-derivative (PID) controller to dynamically adjust this gradient decay rate,
where the adjustment relies on the proposed relative calibration error feedback
in each epoch, thereby preventing the model from exhibiting over-confidence or
under-confidence. Within the PID control system framework, the proposed relative
calibration error serves as the control system output, providing an indication of the
overall confidence level, while the gradient decay rate functions as the controlled
variable. Moreover, recognizing the impact of gradient amplitude of adaptive decay
rates, we implement an adaptive learning rate mechanism for gradient compensa-
tion to prevent inadequate learning of over-small or over-large gradient. Empirical
experiments validate the efficacy of our PID-based adaptive gradient decay rate ap-
proach, ensuring consistent optimization of model calibration and model accuracy.
The code of implementation is available in https://github.com/UHIF/PID_AGD."

Inroduction"
INRODUCTION,0.011494252873563218,"Model calibration aims to refine the uncertainty distribution of model output, ensuring its faithful
reflection of the inherent uncertainty characteristics. Softmax mapping is commonly employed
in the baseline learning to establish the output-probability mapping. Yet, with the escalation in
model parameterizations, the output uncertainty distribution from over-parameterized models tends
to become over-confident [1]. Consequently, the baseline strategy, which exclusively depends on
Softmax mapping without accounting for calibration characteristics as optimization objectives, fails to
achieve perfect model calibration. Particularly in high-risk applications, inadequate model calibration
poses heightened safety risks [2, 3]."
INRODUCTION,0.01532567049808429,"There are three primary strategies for calibrating uncertainty in deep learning models: Bayesian
neural networks, post-processing calibration, and training-based model calibration. Bayesian neural
networks (BNNs) integrate Bayesian inference into their framework, distinguishing them from tradi-
tional neural networks [4, 5]. In contrast to conventional neural networks, which yield point estimates,"

INRODUCTION,0.022988505747126436,"BNNs offer a probability distribution across potential outputs, enabling uncertainty quantification in
predictions [6]. This is accomplished by assigning prior distributions to the network’s parameters and
iteratively updating these distributions using Bayes’ theorem as more data is acquired."
INRODUCTION,0.02681992337164751,"The post-processing calibration methods involve establishing the additional output-probability re-
lationship through supplementary mappings to refine output uncertainty distribution [7, 8, 9]. This
calibration method avoids disrupting the original model’s decision-making pertaining to the primary
task, maintaining the original generalization performance [10]. However, a notable drawback emerges:
the necessity of additional structure to establish the mapping between outputs and probabilities [11].
This task possesses unique characteristics, demanding calibrated properties to construct output-
probability mapping structures, optimization goals, and strategies. Unlike typical loss functions
and metrics in machine learning, uncertainty is sample-specific; however, validating it individually
is infeasible [12]. Furthermore, when validated collectively, it fails to fully represent individual
sample properties, presenting challenges in calibrating individual sample. This presents a difficulty
in calibrating model confidence via post-processing structures [13, 14]."
INRODUCTION,0.03065134099616858,"Another approach to model calibration involves integrating various elements into the baseline opti-
mization strategy for deep learning [7]. This enhancement of elements during the optimization leads
to an improvement in the uncertainty distribution of the model output. These methods encompass a
range of techniques including pre-training [15], data augmentation [16], label smoothing [17], weight
decay [1], early stopping [18], structure sparsity [19], convolutional structure [20], and others. These
methods not only bolster the calibration of the model and refine the output uncertainty distribution
but also delve into the dynamic attributes of the model optimization, thereby enhancing decision-
making. Additionally, they improve the interpretability in the decision-making and optimization
process. Furthermore, certain loss functions for model output distribution have been devised based
on uncertainty properties. These include MMCE [14], Correctness Ranking Loss [21], CALS [22],
Focal loss [23, 24], and FLSD [25]. They jointly address classification accuracy and confidence
calibration to mitigate the inclination of the over-confidence and under-confidence."
INRODUCTION,0.034482758620689655,"In the optimization of Softmax-based cross-entropy loss, model accuracy and model calibration
represent distinct optimization characteristics [26]. Model calibration tends to be overfitting earlier
in the optimization compared to accuracy [1]. To ensure consistent optimization between model
accuracy and calibration, it is imperative to achieve high accuracy while maintaining adequate
calibration. Our approach introduces a hyperparameter that controls the gradient decay rate within
the Softmax output-probability mapping. It indicated a negative correlation between the gradient
decay rate with increasing instance-level probability and the overall confidence distribution [27]. To
achieve consistent optimization of accuracy and calibration, we propose detecting model calibration
through a validation set in the optimization process. Drawing inspiration from the notable success of
proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers in automatic control systems [28], we introduce
an Adaptive Probability-dependent Gradient Decay through PID controller approach to calibrate the
model. Moreover, considering that probability-dependent gradient decay rate may impact gradient
amplitude, we design a dynamic learning rate mechanism corresponding to the changing gradient
decay rate to offset fluctuations in gradient amplitude."
INRODUCTION,0.038314176245210725,"Our main contributions in this work can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose adaptive
probability-dependent gradient decay via PID controller. This approach utilizes the feedback mecha-
nism from automatic control to detect model calibration and adjust the probability-dependent gradient
decay rate coefficient in Softmax, ensuring consistent optimization of model calibration and accuracy.
(2) To counteract fluctuations in gradient magnitude caused by the adaptive probability-dependent
gradient decay rate, we introduce a dynamic learning rate schedule to follow the dynamic decay rate.
(3) Empirical experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving improved model
calibration while maintaining the model’s generalization ability."

METHODOLOGY,0.19157088122605365,"The probability-dependent gradient decay rate exhibits a negative correlation with the model’s
average confidence, as shown in Fig. 2 and Appendix A.2. Higher gradient decay rates result in
a concave reduction in gradient magnitude as the sample confidence increases, thereby yielding a
smoother distribution of confidence. Although high gradient decay rates can mitigate over-confidence
distributions for samples, excessively small or large gradient magnitudes may lead to inadequate
optimization. Consequently, we propose an adaptive gradient decay rate by a PID controller to ensure
model calibration on optimization. Additionally, we propose a variable learning rate schedule to
adjust the gradient and counterbalance the impact of fluctuating gradient decay rates on gradient
magnitude. The whole framework is shown in Fig. 3."

proportionally to the current error. It provides an immediate correction to minimize the RCE.
Secondly, the integral (I) action continuously integrates the error over time and adjusts the control
signal accordingly, eliminating any steady-state error. It eliminates any steady-state error by gradually
reducing the cumulative error to zero. Thirdly, the derivative (D) action anticipates the future behavior
of the error by considering its rate of change, damping oscillations and overshoots to improve system

CONSISTENT OPTIMIZATION IN SUPERVISED LEARNING,0.4674329501915709,"Model accuracy and calibration are typically considered as two independent optimization metrics. In
the baseline optimization strategy employing cross-entropy as the loss function, the model calibration
tend to overfit earlier than the accuracy. To examine the impact of different optimization strategies on
model calibration characteristics, Table 2 illustrates these effects. Comparative algorithms such as
cosface [32], center loss [33], CE with DCA [34] and Softmax-based cross-entropy were utilized, and
their performance in accuracy and uncertainty estimation was observed. While cosface, center loss,
and our proposed approach, showed improvements in accuracy, the former two algorithms did not
consider model calibration, resulting in overconfident predictions. DCA regularity improves model
calibration but hurts accuracy. Conversely, our proposed PID-based method with variable gradient
decay rate ensures both model accuracy and calibration. This reaffirms the significant influence of
probability-dependent gradient decay rates on model calibration and overall performance."

entire control system can be regarded as having a time lag, whereby the controlled variable β exhibits
a certain delay concerning the RCE. While it may be challenging to mathematically describe the
control system, the PID controller serves as a “black-box” controller, leveraging the integral and
differential variations of the error, proving highly effective. The ablation experiments are shown
in Fig. 5. We conclude that model calibration is robust to the choice of PID parameters; however,
setting the PID parameters too high can compromise the stability of ECE during model optimization.
Based on this, we selected PID settings of 1, 0.1, and 1 for the experiments presented above. On the
other hard, in Fig. 5, the accuracy curves with our method all exhibited a noticeable jitter, which

ABLATION EXPERIMENTS OF DIFFERENT OPTIMIZER,0.4942528735632184,"The motivation for proposing the adaptive learning rate for gradient compensation arises from the
observation that significant variations in gradient magnitude can negatively impact the model’s
optimization for classification error. A dynamic learning rate helps maintain a relatively stable
gradient magnitude. Additionally, the Adam optimizer aids in reducing gradient fluctuations. To
verify the novelty of our method, Table 3 presents the performance of various optimizers when
applied to our proposed PID controller-based calibration method."
ABLATION EXPERIMENTS OF DIFFERENT OPTIMIZER,0.49808429118773945,"Our experimental results indicate that Adam can indeed provide a more stable gradient and calibration
performance, particularly in conjunction with our PID controller approach for model calibration.
However, it is notable that Adam results in reduced accuracy, achieving only 63.5% on CIFAR-100
with ResNet35, significantly lower than the baseline accuracy of 73.8%. A key difference arises
in the baseline case handled by Adam. In our proposed PID controller method, which adjusts the
hyperparameter β during model calibration, the loss function is dynamic. While Adam retains
previous gradient information, this can conflict with the current gradient vector direction because the
optimization objective is dynamic. In contrast, our compensation method only modifies the learning
rate and retains gradient vector direction pertinent to the current loss function. This may explain why
the Adam optimizer does not yield better results."

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.5057471264367817,"The gradient decay rate plays a crucial role in shaping the calibration characteristics and uncertainty
distribution of deep learning throughout the dynamic optimization. Our results show a negative
correlation between the gradient decay rate with increasing instance-level probability and the overall
confidence distribution. This paper introduces a novel optimization approach aimed at regulating
the gradient decay rate hyperparameter β, via a PID controller. The goal is to achieve perfect
model calibration by monitoring the proposed relative calibration error of the validation set. Within
this control system framework as shown in Fig. 3, the probabilistic gradient decay rate serves as
the controlled variable, while a newly defined relative calibration error acts as the control system
output, mitigating both over-confidence and under-confidence in the model. Additionally, to address
fluctuations of gradient amplitude resulting from varying gradient decay rate, a new learning rate
compensation mechanism is employed. Empirical validation demonstrates that our proposed adaptive
gradient decay rate optimization strategy, facilitated by a PID controller, effectively enhances both
the accuracy and model calibration in deep learning, ensuring adequate calibration throughout the
supervised learning."

model calibration are presented in Tab. 4, Tab. 5 and Tab. 6, while confidence histograms and relia-
bility diagrams are depicted in Figs. 6-9. These experiments consistently conclude that the gradient
decay rate β is negatively correlated with the overall confidence level of the model. Specifically,
when the value β is small, the gradient decay rate decreases, leading to higher overall confidence
in the model output and a greater likelihood of overconfident probabilistic output. Conversely, as
the value β increases, the gradient decay rate increases, resulting in lower overall confidence in the
model’s output and a higher probability of underfitting in the model’s probabilistic output distribution.
Although model accuracy appears somewhat linked to this hyperparameter, conclusive generalizations
from theoretical perspective cannot be drawn for the current experimental results."

Limitations and future works"
REFERENCES,0.7739463601532567,"Our work currently lacks theoretical analysis. Although all experimental findings consistently
demonstrate the impact of gradient decay rate β on model calibration, we still require theoretical
frameworks to explain how the gradient decay rate affects the overall confidence distribution. Our
experiments indicate that large gradient decay rates result in similar confidence levels across samples,
while smaller rates yield more discriminatory levels. In essence, smaller decay rates enforce a
more stringent curriculum learning sequence, whereby increased confidence in difficult samples
only occurs after optimizing easier ones. Consequently, this leads to greater differentiation in final
confidence distribution of different samples. While these empirical observations are compelling, they
lack theoretical substantiation."
REFERENCES,0.7777777777777778,"Methodologically, our current approach employs a PID controller to control gradient decay in opti-
mization. However, in practice, the effect of gradient decay rate adjustments on model calibration
requires a large number of epochs to manifest changes. Viewed from a control systems perspective,
this delay indicates a substantial time lag in the control object. However, as neural network optimiza-
tion processes defy mathematical description, designing effective controllers becomes inherently
challenging. Furthermore, our work also lacks comprehensive statistical analysis of the calibrated
outputs. Future research should address how alterations in the dynamic gradient decay rate impact
the internal optimization process."
REFERENCES,0.7816091954022989,"Additionally, the temperature coefficient τ also impacts model calibration. The Softmax with small τ
disperses the inter-class distance by adjusting the probability output to focus more on hard negative
samples. Nevertheless, large τ can only smooth the output of all categories and cannot mine more
information from simple positive samples. On the contrary, small β makes the gradient decay slowly
so that easy positive samples can be sufficiently learned up to high confidence. An appropriate β can
mining more discriminative features on the whole. Similarly, large β only keeps the samples at the
same level of confidence and cannot extract more meaningful features from challenging samples. τ
and β improved the mining capability of Softmax in two different dimensions. The exploration of
optimizing the effects of both hyperparameters to improve model calibration represents a promising
approach."

CLAIMS,0.7931034482758621,"Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Motivation and two technical contributions are articulated in the abstract and
introduction.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.7969348659003831,"• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.8007662835249042,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please find limitations and future works in Appendx A.3.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8045977011494253,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8160919540229885,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility"
CLAIMS,0.8199233716475096,"Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please find Train setting in Section 4 and Algorithm 1.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8237547892720306,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code"

tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?"
CLAIMS,0.8314176245210728,"Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The code is available in https://github.com/UHIF/PID_AGD. Please find
Abstract.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8352490421455939,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details"
CLAIMS,0.8390804597701149,"Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please find Train setting in Section 4.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.842911877394636,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance"
CLAIMS,0.8467432950191571,"Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The descriptions of the figures are in the caption. All metrics are defined, such
as (1)-(2) or added relevant references.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8505747126436781,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors)."
CLAIMS,0.8544061302681992,"• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text."

BROADER IMPACTS,0.9233716475095786,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations."
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9272030651340997,"• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9310344827586207,11. Safeguards
SAFEGUARDS,0.9348659003831418,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?"
SAFEGUARDS,0.9386973180076629,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.9425287356321839,Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
SAFEGUARDS,0.946360153256705,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9501915708812261,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
