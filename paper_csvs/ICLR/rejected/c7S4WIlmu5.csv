ABSTRACT,0.004830917874396135,"Information retrieval is an important component in natural language processing, for
knowledge intensive tasks such as question answering and fact checking. Recently,
information retrieval has seen the emergence of dense retrievers, based on neural
networks, as an alternative to classical sparse methods based on term-frequency.
These models have obtained state-of-the-art results on datasets and tasks where
large training sets are available. However, they do not transfer well to new domains
or applications with no training data, and are often outperformed by term-frequency
methods such as BM25 which are not supervised. Thus, a natural question is
whether it is possible to train dense retrievers without supervision. In this work,
we explore the limits of contrastive learning as a way to train unsupervised dense
retrievers, and show that it leads to strong retrieval performance. More precisely,
we show on the BEIR benchmark that our model outperforms BM25 on 8 out of 14
datasets. Furthermore, when a few thousands examples are available, we show that
ﬁne-tuning our model on these leads to strong improvements compared to BM25.
Finally, when used as pre-training before ﬁne-tuning on the MS MARCO dataset,
our technique obtains state-of-the-art results on the BEIR benchmark."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.014492753623188406,"Document retrieval is the task of ﬁnding relevant documents in a large collection to answer spe-
ciﬁc queries. This is an important task by itself and a core component of many natural language
processing (NLP) problems, such as open domain question answering (Chen et al., 2017) or fact
checking (Thorne et al., 2018). Traditionally, retrieval systems, or retrievers, leverage lexical similari-
ties to match queries and documents, using, for instance, TF-IDF or BM25 weighting (Robertson
& Zaragoza, 2009). These approaches, based on exact matches between tokens of the queries and
documents, suffer from the lexical gap and do not generalize well (Berger et al., 2000). By contrast,
approaches based on neural networks allow learning beyond lexical similarities, resulting in state-of-
the-art performance on question answering benchmarks, such as MS-MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016)
or NaturalQuestion (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.01932367149758454,"As training neural networks requires large amount of data, their strong retrieval results were possible
for domains and applications where large training datasets are available. In the case of retrieval,
creating these datasets requires manually matching queries to the relevant documents in the collection.
This is hardly possible when the collection contains millions or billions of element, resulting in many
scenarios where only a few in-domain examples, if any, are available. A potential solution is to train
a dense retriever on a large retrieval dataset such as MS MARCO, and then apply it to new domains,
a setting refered to as zero-shot. Unfortunately, in this setting dense retrievers are often outperformed
by classical methods based on term-frequency, which do not require supervision (Thakur et al., 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.024154589371980676,"Thus, a natural alternative to transfer learning is unsupervised learning, which raises the following
question: is it possible to train dense retrievers without supervision, and match the performance of
BM25? Training dense retrievers without supervision can be achieved by using a pretext task that
approximates retrieval. Given a document, one can generate a synthetic query and then train the
network to retrieve the original document, among many others, given the query. The inverse Cloze
task (ICT), proposed by Lee et al. (2019) to pre-train retrievers, uses a given sentence as query and
predict the context surrounding it. While showing promising results as pre-training (Chang et al.,
2020; Sachan et al., 2021a), this approach still lags behind BM25 when used as a zero-shot retriever."

INTRODUCTION,0.033816425120772944,"ICT is strongly related to contrastive learning (Wu et al., 2018), which has been widely applied in
computer vision (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020). In particular, computer vision models trained
with the latest contrastive learning methods lead to features well suited to retrieval (Caron et al.,
2021). In this work, we thus propose to revisit how well contrastive learning performs to train dense
retrievers without supervision. We want to investigate how much the recent developments from
computer vision, such as MoCo, can improve dense retrievers. Here, our goal is not to develop new
techniques, but to determine how far we can go by pushing existing methods to their limits."
INTRODUCTION,0.03864734299516908,"In this paper, we thus make the following contributions. First, we show that contrastive learning
can lead to strong unsupervised retrievers: our model achieves Recall@100 results competitive with
BM25 on most of the BEIR benchmark. Second, in a few-shot setting, we show that our model
beneﬁts from few training examples, and obtains better results than transfering models from large
datasets such as MS MARCO. Third, when used as a pre-training method before ﬁne-tuning on
MS MARCO, our technique leads to state-of-the-art retrieval performance on the BEIR benchmark.
Finally, we perform ablations to motivate our design choices, and show that cropping works better
than the inverse Cloze task."

learning to this problem. This is not an exhaustive review, and we refer the reader to Manning et al.

RELATED WORK,0.05314009661835749,"Term-frequency based information retrieval.
Historically, in information retrieval, documents
and queries are represented as sparse vectors where each element of the vectors corresponds to a term
of the vocabulary. Different weighing schemes have been proposed, to determine how important a
particular term is to a document in a large dataset. One of the most used weighing scheme is known
as TF-IDF, and is based on inverse document frequency, or term speciﬁcity (Jones, 1972). BM25,
which is still widely used today, extends TF-IDF (Robertson et al., 1995). A well known limitation of
these approaches is that they rely on exact match to retrieve documents. This lead to the introduction
of latent semantic analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990), in which documents are represented as low
dimensional dense vectors."
RELATED WORK,0.057971014492753624,"Neural network based information retrieval.
Following the successful application of deep learn-
ing methods to natural language processing, neural networks techniques were introduced for informa-
tion retrieval. Huang et al. (2013) proposed a deep bag-of-words model, in which representations of
queries and documents are computed independently. A relevance score is then obtained by taking
the dot product between representations, and the model is trained end-to-end on click data from a
search engine. This method was later reﬁned by replacing the bag-of-words model by convolutional
neural networks (Shen et al., 2014) or recurrent neural network (Palangi et al., 2016). A limitation
of bi-encoders is that queries and documents are represented by a single vector, preventing the
model to capture ﬁne-grained interactions between terms. Nogueira & Cho (2019) thus introduced a
cross-encoder model, based on a pre-trained BERT model (Devlin et al., 2019), which jointly encodes
queries and documents. The application of a strong pre-trained model, as well as the cross-encoder
architecture, lead to important improvement on the MS-MARCO benchmark (Bajaj et al., 2016)."
RELATED WORK,0.06280193236714976,"The methods described in the previous paragraph were applied to re-rank documents, which were
retrieved with a traditional IR system such as BM25. Gillick et al. (2018) ﬁrst studied whether
continuous retrievers, based on bi-encoder neural models, could be viable alternative to re-ranking.
In the context of question answering, Karpukhin et al. (2020) introduced a dense passage retriever
(DPR) based on the bi-encoder architecture. This model is initialized with a BERT network, and
trained discriminatively using pairs of queries and relevant documents, with hard negatives from
BM25. Xiong et al. (2020) further extended this work by mining hard negatives with the model
itself during optimization, and trained on the MS-MARCO dataset. Once a collection of documents,
such as Wikipedia articles, is encoded, retrieval is performed with a fast k-nearest neighbors library
such as FAISS Johnson et al. (2019). To alleviate the limitations of bi-encoders, Humeau et al.
(2019) introduces the poly-encoder architecture, where documents are encoded by multiple vectors.
Similarly, Khattab et al. (2020) proposes the ColBERT model, which keeps a vector representation
for each term of the queries and documents. To make the retrieval tractable, the term-level function"

RELATED WORK,0.07246376811594203,"is approximated to ﬁrst retrieve an initial set of candidates, which are then re-ranked with the true
score. In the context of question answering, knowledge distillation has been used to train retrievers,
either using the attention scores of the reader of the downstream task as synthetic labels (Izacard &
Grave, 2021), or the relevance score from a cross encoder (Yang & Seo, 2020). Luan et al. (2020)
compares, theoretically and empirically, the performance of sparse and dense retrievers, including bi-,
cross- and poly-encoders. Dense retrievers, such as DPR, can lead to indices that weigh close to
100 GB when encoding document collections such as Wikipedia. Izacard et al. (2020) shows how to
compress such indices, with limited impact on performance, making them more practical to use."
RELATED WORK,0.07729468599033816,"Self-supervised learning for NLP.
Following the success of word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), many
self-supervised techniques have been proposed to learn representation of text. Here, we brieﬂy review
the ones that are most related to our approach: sentence level models and contrastive techniques.
Jernite et al. (2017) introduced different objective function to learn sentence representations, including
next sentence prediction and binary order prediction. These objectives were later used in pre-trained
models based on transformers, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and AlBERT (Lan et al., 2019). In
the context of retrieval, Lee et al. (2019) introduced the inverse cloze task (ICT), whose purpose is
to predict the context surrounding a span of text. Guu et al. (2020) integrated a bi-encoder retriever
model in a BERT pre-training scheme. The retrieved documents are used as additional context in the
BERT task, and the whole system is trained end-to-end in an unsupervised way. Similarly, Lewis et al.
(2020) proposed to jointly learn a retriever and a generative seq2seq model, using self-supervised
training. Chang et al. (2020) compares different pre-training tasks for retrieval, including the inverse
cloze task. Constrastive learning was introduced in computer vision by Wu et al. (2018), followed
by several modiﬁcations to improve the training (He et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Caron et al.,
2020). In the context of natural language processing, Fang et al. (2020) proposed to apply MoCo
where positive pairs of sentences are obtained using back-translation. Different works augmented
the masked language modeling objective with a contrastive loss (Giorgi et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020;
Meng et al., 2021). Finally, SBERT (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019) uses a siamese network similar to
contrastive learning to learn a BERT-like model that is adapted to matching sentence embeddings.
Their formulation is similar to our work but requires aligned pairs of sentences to form positive pairs
while we propose to use data augmentation to leverage large unaligned textual corpora. Concurrent to
this work, Gao & Callan (2021) have also shown the potential of contrastive learning for information
retrieval; building on the same observation that both tasks share a similar structure."

METHOD,0.09178743961352658,"The objective of a retriever is to ﬁnd relevant documents in a large collection for a given query.
Thus, the retriever takes as input the set of documents and the query and outputs a relevance score
for each document. A standard approach is to encode each query–document pair with a neural
network (Nogueira & Cho, 2019). This procedure requires re-encoding every document for any
new query and hence does not scale to large collections of documents. Instead, we propose to use
a bi-encoder architecture, where documents and queries are encoded independently (Huang et al.,
2013; Karpukhin et al., 2020). One can compute the relevance score by taking the dot product (or
cosine similarity) between the document’s representation and the representation of the query. More
precisely, given a pair of query q and document d, we encode each of them independently using
the same model, fθ, parametrized by θ. The relevance score s(q, d) is then the dot product of the
resulting representations:"

representation fθ(q) (resp. fθ(d)) for a query (resp. document) is obtained by averaging the hidden
representations of the last layer. Following previous work on dense retrieval with neural networks, we
use the BERT base uncased architecture and refer the reader to Devlin et al. (2019) for more details."

CONTRASTIVE LEARNING"
CONTRASTIVE LEARNING,0.12560386473429952,"Contrastive learning is an approach that relies on the fact that every document is, in some way, unique.
This signal is the only information available in the absence of manual supervision. The resulting
algorithm learns by discriminating between documents, using a contrastive loss (Wu et al., 2018).
This loss compares either positive (from the same document) or negative (from different documents)
pairs of document representations. More formally, given a positive pair of representations (q, k+)
and a set of negative pairs (q, ki)i=0..K, the contrastive InfoNCE loss is deﬁned as:"

be high and that of dissimilar examples to be low. Another interpretation of this loss function is the
following: given the query representation q, the goal is to recover, or retrieve, the representation k+
corresponding to the positive document, among all the negatives ki. In the following, we refer to the
left-hand side representations in the score s as queries and the right-hand side representations as keys."

BUILDING POSITIVE PAIRS FROM A SINGLE DOCUMENT"
BUILDING POSITIVE PAIRS FROM A SINGLE DOCUMENT,0.14492753623188406,"A crucial element of contrastive learning is how to build positive pairs from a single input. In
computer vision, this step relies on applying two independent data augmentations to the same image,
resulting in two “views” that form a positive pair (Wu et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020). While we
consider similar independent text transformation, we also explore dependent transformations designed
to reduce the correlation between views."
BUILDING POSITIVE PAIRS FROM A SINGLE DOCUMENT,0.1497584541062802,"Inverse Cloze Task
is a data augmentation that generates two mutually exclusive views of a
document, introduced in the context of retrieval by Lee et al. (2019). The idea is to take a span of
tokens to form one view, and its complementary to form the other view. More precisely, given a
sequence of text (w1, ..., wn), ICT samples a span a, b, where 1 ≤a < b ≤n, uses the tokens of the
span as the query and the rest of the tokens as the document (or key). In the original implementation
by Lee et al. (2019) the span corresponds to a sentence, and is kept in the document 10% of the time
to encourage lexical matching."
BUILDING POSITIVE PAIRS FROM A SINGLE DOCUMENT,0.15458937198067632,"Independent cropping
is a common independent data augmentation used for images where views
are generated independently by cropping the input. In the context of text, cropping is equivalent to
sampling a span of tokens. This strategy thus samples independently two spans from a document to
form a positive pair. As opposed to the inverse Cloze task, in cropping both views of the example
correspond to contiguous subsequence of the original data. A second difference between cropping
and ICT is the fact that the task is symmetric: both the queries and documents follow the same
distribution. Independent cropping can also lead to overlap between the two views of the data, hence
encouraging the network to learn exact matches between the query and document, in a way that is
similar to lexical matching methods like BM25. In practice, we can either ﬁx the length of the span
for the query and the key, or sample them."

BUILDING LARGE SET OF NEGATIVE PAIRS,0.178743961352657,"Negative pairs within a batch.
A ﬁrst solution, called SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020), is to generate
the negative pairs by using the other examples from the same batch: each example in a batch is
transformed twice to generate positive pairs, and we generate negative pairs by using the views
from the other examples in the batch. In that case, the gradient is back-propagated through the
representations of both the queries and the keys. A downside of this approach is that it requires
extremely large batch sizes to work well. This technique was also considered when using ICT to
pre-train retrievers by Lee et al. (2019)."
BUILDING LARGE SET OF NEGATIVE PAIRS,0.18357487922705315,"Negative pairs across batches.
An alternative approach is to store representations from previous
batches in a queue and use them as negative examples in the loss (Wu et al., 2018). This allows for
smaller batch size but slightly changes the loss by making it asymmetric between “queries” (one of
the view generated from the elements of the current batch), and “keys” (the other generated views, as
well as the elements stored in the queue). Gradient is only backpropagated through the “queries”,
and the representation of the “keys” are considered as ﬁxed. In practice, the features stored in the
queue from previous batches comes form previous iterations of the network. This leads to a drop of
performance when the network rapidly changes during training. Instead, He et al. (2020) proposed to
generate representations of keys from a second network that is updated more slowly. This approach,
called MoCo, considers two networks: one for the keys, parametrized by θk, and one of the query,
parametrized by θq. The parameters of the query network are updated with backpropagation and
stochastic gradient descent, like in SimCLR, while the parameters of the key network, or Momentum
encoder, is updated from the parameters of the query network by using a exponential moving average:"

on diversity. Each dataset is made of a set of queries, the corresponding relevant documents and a
large collection of documents to retrieve from. These datasets correspond to nine different retrieval
tasks, such as fact checking, question answering, entity retrieval or citation prediction. Moreover, the
benchmark covers a large number of domains, such as Wikipedia, news articles, scientiﬁc publications

queries ranging from 3 to 190 words and documents from 11 to 630 words.
Most datasets from
the BEIR benchmark do not contain a training set, and the focus of the benchmark is zero-shot
retrieval. However, most machine learning based retrievers are still trained on supervised data, such
as the large scale retrieval dataset MS-MARCO (Bajaj et al., 2016). Following standard practice, we
report two metrics on this benchmark, the nDGC@10 and the Recall@100. These two metrics are
complementary and both important: nDCG focuses on the ranking of the top 10 retrieved documents,
and is good at evaluating documents returned to human, for example in a search engine. On the other
hand, the Recall@100 is relevant to evaluate retrievers that are included in marchine learning systems,
such as question answering. Indeed, such models can process hundreds of documents, and ignore the

include the TAS-B technique (Hofstätter et al., 2021), which performs distillation from a cross-encoder
to a bi-encoder model. Finally, we compare to GenQ, which uses a generative query model to create
synthetic query-document pairs, and is applied to each dataset. Thus, a different GenQ model is used
for each dataset of the BEIR benchmark. For late-interaction methods, we use ColBERT (Khattab
et al., 2020), which computes pairwise scores between contextualized representations of the query
and the document. To make this approach scalable, this scoring function is only applied on documents
obtained by applying an approximation of the full score. Interestingly, it should be noted that BM25
is a very competitive baseline in the zero-shot setting, outperforming all dense retrievers on average
over the BEIR benchmark. Only the re-ranking models and the query expansion (docT5query), which
is also based on BM25, obtain better results than BM25."

with a batch size of 4,096 and restrict the queue in MoCo to the same number of elements. This

Finally, we study the impact of the pre-training data on the performance of our
retriever, by training on Wikipedia, CCNet or a mix of both sources of data. We report results in
Table 5, and observe that there is no clear winner between the two data sources. Unsurprisingly,
pre-training on Wikipedia leads to better performance on datasets for which documents also come
from Wikipedia, such as NaturalQuestions or FEVER. On the other hand, on datasets from different
domains than Wikipedia such as FiQA or ArguAna, training on the more diverse CCNet data leads to
better results. To get the best of both worlds, we consider to strategies to mix the two data sources. In
the “50/50%” strategy, examples are sampled uniformly across domain, meaning that half the batches
are from Wikipedia and the other half from CCNet. In the “uniform” strategy, examples are sampled
uniformly over the union of the dataset. Since CCNet is signiﬁcantly larger than Wikipedia, this
means that most of the batches are from CCNet."

SCIFACTS,0.6280193236714976,"In this work, we propose to explore the limits of contrastive pre-training to learn dense text retrievers.
We use the MoCo technique, which allows us to train with a large number of negative examples.
We make several interesting observations: ﬁrst, while the inverse Cloze task has been introduced in
the context of retrieval, we show that independent random cropping leads to better results. Second,
we show that neural networks trained without supervision using contrastive learning exhibits good
(albeit not state-of-the-art) retrieval performance. Based on these observations, we trained a model
that obtains state-of-the-art performance on the BEIR benchmark when ﬁne-tuned on MS-MARCO."

For the model with ﬁne-tuning on MS-MARCO (respectively, without
ﬁne-tuning), we use the MoCo algorithm He et al. (2020) with a queue of size 65536 (resp. 131,072),
a momentum value of 0.999 (resp. 0.9995) and a temperature of 0.05. We use the random cropping
data augmentation, with documents of 256 tokens and span sizes sampled between 10% and 50%
(resp. 5% and 50%) of the document length. We also apply word deletion with a probability of 20%.
We optimize the model with the AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) optimizer, with learning rate
of 10−4 (resp. 5 · 10−5), batch size of 2,048 and 500,000 (resp. 200,000) steps. We initialize the
network with the publicly available BERT base uncased model. For training data, we use a data from
Wikipedia (resp. a mix between Wikipedia and CC-net data (Wenzek et al., 2020), where half the
batches are sampled from each source)."

of 0.05, also used during pretraining. We train an initial model with random negative examples for
20000 steps, mine hard negatives with this ﬁrst model, and re-train a second model with those. Each
query is associated with a gold document and a negative document, which is a random document in
the ﬁrst phase and a hard negative 10% of the time in the second phase. All documents from a batch
