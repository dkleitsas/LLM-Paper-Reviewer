ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0035211267605633804,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have drawn signiﬁcant research attention recently,
mostly under the setting of semi-supervised learning. When task-agnostic rep-
resentations are preferred or supervision is simply unavailable, the auto-encoder
framework comes in handy with a natural graph reconstruction objective for un-
supervised GNN training. However, existing graph auto-encoders are designed to
reconstruct the direct links, so GNNs trained in this way are only optimized towards
proximity-oriented graph mining tasks, and will fall short when the topological
structures matter. In this work, we revisit the graph encoding process of GNNs
which essentially learns to encode the neighborhood information of each node into
an embedding vector, and propose a novel graph decoder to reconstruct the entire
neighborhood information regarding both proximity and structure via Neighbor-
hood Wasserstein Reconstruction (NWR). Speciﬁcally, from the GNN embedding
of each node, NWR jointly predicts its node degree and neighbor feature distribu-
tion, where the distribution prediction adopts an optimal-transport loss based on
the Wasserstein distance. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
network datasets show that the unsupervised node representations learned with
NWR have much more advantageous in structure-oriented graph mining tasks,
while also achieving competitive performance in proximity-oriented ones.1"

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01056338028169014,"Network/Graph representation learning (a.k.a. embedding) aims to preserve the high-dimensional
complex graph information involving node features and link structures in a low-dimensional em-
bedding space, which requires effective feature selection and dimension reduction (Hamilton et al.,
2017b). Graph neural networks (GNNs) have done great jobs to this end, but most of them rely
on node labels from speciﬁc downstream tasks to be trained in a semi-supervised fashion (Kipf &
Welling, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017a; Wu et al., 2019; Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018a; Klicpera et al.,
2019; Chien et al., 2021). However, similar to other domains, unsupervised representation learning is
preferred in many cases, not only because labeled data is not always available (Hu et al., 2020; Xie
et al., 2021), but also task-agnostic representations can better transfer and generalize among different
scenarios (Erhan et al., 2010; Bengio, 2012; Radford et al., 2016)."
INTRODUCTION,0.014084507042253521,"To train GNNs in an unsupervised fashion, the classic auto-encoder framework (Baldi, 2012; Good-
fellow et al., 2016) provides a natural solution and has been widely explored such as the prominent
work (V)GAE (Kipf & Welling, 2016). Speciﬁcally, classic auto-encoders aim to decode from the
low-dimensional representations information in the entire receptive ﬁeld of the neural networks. For
GNNs, the receptive ﬁeld of a node representation is its entire neighborhood. However, existing graph
auto-encoders appear away from such a motivation and are designed to merely decode the direct
links between the node pairs by minimizing a link reconstruction loss. The fundamental difﬁculty to
reconstruct the entire receptive ﬁelds of GNNs is due to the non-trivial design of a reconstruction loss
on the irregular graph structures. Unfortunately, the over-simpliﬁcation into link reconstruction makes
the learned node representations drop much information and thus provides undesired performance in
many downstream tasks."

in real-world graphs and the two-dimensional node embedding spaces learned by different models.
Colors indicates node features. The nodes with same digits are transitive in some graph automorphism."
INTRODUCTION,0.028169014084507043,"Take Figure 1 as an example, where different types of information are mixed in a graph (e.g., proximity
and structure information as illustrated in Figure 5 in Appendix B (Cui et al., 2021)). The node
representations learned by existing graph auto-encoders such as GAE (Kipf & Welling, 2016) are
driven too much to be similar on linked nodes due to their simple link reconstruction objective,
and thus fail to distinguish node pairs like (2, 4) and (3, 5) in the cliques, though they clearly have
different structural roles and node features. On the other hand, structure-oriented embedding models
like GraphWave (Donnat et al., 2018) cannot consider node features and spatial proximity, and thus
fail to distinguish node pairs like (0, 1), (2, 4) and (3, 5) though they have different features, as well
as (2, 5) and (3, 4) though they are further apart. An ideal unsupervised node representation learning
model as we advocate in this work is expected to be task-agnostic and encode as much information as
possible of all types in a low-dimensional embedding space."
INTRODUCTION,0.03169014084507042,"In this work, we aim to fundamentally address the above limitations of existing unsupervised node
representation learning models by proposing a novel graph auto-encoder framework for unsupervised
GNN training. The new framework is equipped with a powerful decoder that fully reconstructs the
information from the entire receptive ﬁeld of a node representation. Our key technical contribution
lies in designing a principled and easy-to-compute loss to reconstruct the entire irregular structures of
the node neighborhood. Speciﬁcally, we characterize the decoding procedure as iteratively sampling
from a series of probability distributions deﬁned over multi-hop neighbors’ representations obtained
through the GNN encoder. Then, the reconstruction loss can be decomposed into three parts, for
sampling numbers (node degrees), neighbor-representation distributions and node features. All of
these terms are easy to compute but may represent the entire receptive ﬁeld of a node instead of just
the linkage information to its direct neighbors. For the most novel and important term, neighbor-
representation distribution reconstruction, we adopt an optimal-transport loss based on Wasserstein
distance (Frogner et al., 2015) and thus name this new framework as Neighborhood Wasserstein
Reconstruction Graph Auto-Encoder (NWR-GAE). As also illustrated in Figure 1, NWR-GAE can
effectively distinguish all pairs of nodes dissimilar in different perspectives, and concisely reﬂect
their similarities in the low-dimensional embedding space."
INTRODUCTION,0.035211267605633804,"We have conducted extensive experiments on four synthetic datasets and nine real-world datasets.
Among the real-world datasets, three have proximity-oriented tasks, three have structure-oriented
tasks, and three have proximity-structure-mixed tasks. We can observe signiﬁcant improvements
brought by NWR-GAE over the best method among the state-of-the-art baselines on all structure-
oriented tasks (8.74% to 18.48%) and proximity-structure-mixed tasks (-2.98% to 8.62%), and
competitive performance on proximity-oriented tasks (-3.21% to -0.32%). In-depth ablation and
hyper-parameter studies further consolidate the claimed advantages of NWR-GAE."

PRELIMINARIES, MOTIVATIONS & OTHER RELATED WORKS"
INTRODUCTION,0.04225352112676056,"In this work, we focus on the auto-encoder framework for unsupervised task-agnostic graph repre-
sentation learning. The original motivation of auto-encoders is to perform neural-network-based
dimension reduction of the data that originally lies in a high-dimensional space (Hinton & Salakhutdi-
nov, 2006). Speciﬁcally, an auto-encoder consists of two components, an encoder and a decoder. The
encoder works to compress each data point into a low-dimensional vector representation, while the
decoder works to reconstruct the original information from this vector. By minimizing the reconstruc-"

representations to capture as much information as possible from the original data."
-HOP NEIGHBORHOOD,0.07042253521126761,"Although the above high-level idea of auto-encoders is clear, when it is applied to graph structured
data, the problem becomes challenging. This is because in graph-structured data, information of data
points (nodes to be speciﬁc as most widely studied) is correlated due to the ambient graph structure.
Without a speciﬁc task needed in a priori, the learned low-dimensional representation of a node
should carry as much information as possible from not only its own features but also the features of
the nodes it connects to (both directly and indirectly)."
-HOP NEIGHBORHOOD,0.07394366197183098,"This implies that when building auto-encoders for graph-structure data, we expect the node represen-
tations to be able to reconstruct all correlated node features. However, existing graph auto-encoders
seem to be away from this motivation. Previous prominent works such as unsupervised Graph-
SAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017a), GAE (Kipf & Welling, 2016), their generative variants such as
VGAE (Kipf & Welling, 2016), CondGen (Yang et al., 2019) (), and many others (Grover et al.,
2019; Pan et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021), use GNNs to encode graph structured
data into node representations. Without exception, they follow the rationale of traditional network
embedding techniques (Perozzi et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2018; Grover & Leskovec, 2016) and adopt
link reconstruction in the decoder as the main drive to optimize their GNN encoders. The obtained
node representations best record the network linkage information but lose much of other important
information, such as local structures, neighbors’ features, etc. Hence, these auto-encoders will most
likely fail in other tasks such as node classiﬁcations (especially structure-oriented ones as manifested
in Figure 1)."
-HOP NEIGHBORHOOD,0.07746478873239436,"To better understand this point, we carefully analyze the source of information encoded in each
node representation via a GNN. Suppose a standard message-passing GNN (Gilmer et al., 2017) is
adopted as the encoder, which is a general framework that includes GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017),
GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017a), GAT (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018a), GIN (Xu et al., 2019c) and so
on. After k-hop message passing, the source of information encoded in the representation of a node v
essentially comes from the k-hop neighborhood of v (Fig. 2). Therefore, a good representation of
node v should capture the information of features from all nodes in its k-hop neighborhood, which is
agnostic to downstream tasks. Note that this may not be ideal as nodes out of k-hop neighborhood may
also provide useful information, but this is what GNN-based graph auto-encoders can be expected
to do due to the architectures of GNN encoders. This observation motivates our study on a novel
graph decoder that can better facilitate the goal of GNN-based graph auto-encoders, based on the
neighborhood reconstruction principle. We will formalize this principle in Sec. 3."
-HOP NEIGHBORHOOD,0.08098591549295775,"Relation to the InfoMax principle. Recently, DGI (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018b), EGI (Zhu et al.,
2021) and others (Sun et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020; You et al., 2020; Hassani & Khasahmadi, 2020;
Suresh et al., 2021) have used constrasive learning for unsupervised GNN training methods and
may capture information beyond the directed links. They adopt the rule of mutual information
maximization (InfoMax), which essentially works to maximize certain correspondence between the
learned representations and the original data. For example, DGI (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018b) maximizes
the correspondence between a node representation and which graph the node belongs to, but this has
no guarantee to reconstruct the structural information of node neighborhoods. Recent works even
demonstrate that maximizing such correspondence risks capturing only the noisy information that
is irrelevant to the downsteam tasks because noisy information itself is sufﬁcient for the models to
achieve InfoMax (Tschannen et al., 2020; Suresh et al., 2021), which gets demonstrated again by
our experiments. Our goal instead is to let node representations not just capture the information to
distinguish nodes but capture as much information as possible to reconstruct the features and structure
of the neighborhood."

of the distance between two probability measures. The family f-divergence has the non-continuous
issue when the two measures of interest have non-overlapped support (Ali & Silvey, 1966). Therefore,
OT-losses are often adopted and have shown great success in generative models (Gulrajani et al.,
2017) and domain adaptation (Courty et al., 2016). OT-losses have been used to build variational
auto-encoders for non-graph data (Tolstikhin et al., 2018; Kolouri et al., 2018; Patrini et al., 2020).
But one should note the our work is not a graph-data-oriented generalization of these works: They
use OT-losses to characterize the distance between the variational distribution and the data empirical
distribution while our model even does not use a variational distribution. Our model may be further
improved by being reformulated as a variational autoencoder but we leave it as a future direction."

FNNs to (approximately) reconstruct any distributions in 1-Wasserstein distance, as formally stated
in Theorem 3.1 (See the proof in Appendix A, reproduced by Theorem 2.1 in (Lu & Lu, 2020)). For
a better empirical performance, our case adopts the 2-Wasserstein distance and an FNN with m-dim
output instead of the gradient of an FNN with 1-dim outout. Here, the reparameterization trick needs
to be used (Kingma & Welling, 2014), i.e.,
ψ(i)

distance between two graphs, where Wasserstein distance between the two sets of node embeddings

FURTHER DISCUSSION — DECODERS ψs AND ψd"

In practice, the original node features X could be very high-dimensional and reconstructing them
directly may introduce a lot of noise into the node representations. Instead, we may ﬁrst map X
into a latent space to initialize H(0). However, if H(0) is used in both representation learning and
reconstruction, it has the risk to collapse to trivial points. Hence, we normalize H(0) = {h(0)
v |v ∈V }
properly via pair-norm (Zhao & Akoglu, 2020) to avoid this trap as follows
{h(0)
v |v ∈V } = pair-norm({xvW|v ∈V }), where W is a learnable parameter matrix.

Real-world graph Datasets. We use a total of nine public real-world graph datasets, which roughly
belong to three types, one with proximity-oriented (assortative (Liu et al., 2020)) labels, one with
structure-oriented (disassortative) labels, and one with proximity-structure-mixed labels. Among

size efﬁciency is an important metric for unsupervised representation learning, which reﬂects the
effectiveness in information compression. As can be seen in Figure 4 (a), NWR-GAE quickly converges
when the embedding size reaches 200-300 on the mid-scale datasets of Chameleon and Squirrel,
and maintains good performance as the sizes further increase without overﬁtting. Moreover, as we
can observe from the training curves of NWR-GAE on Chameleon in Figure 4 (b), the performance
of NWR-GAE is robust to the neighborhood sampling sizes, where the larger size of 15 only leads
to slightly better performance than the smaller size of 5. NWR-GAE also converges rapidly after
1-2 training epochs, achieving signiﬁcantly better performance compared with the best baseline of
DeepWalk and typical baselines like DGI. As we can observe from the runtimes of NWR-GAE on

runtimes, while our runtimes are much better compared with typical baselines like DeepWalk and
DGI, especially under the fact that we can converge rather rapidly observed from Figure 4 (b)."
EVALUATION METRICS,0.4647887323943662,"Finally, to further understand the effectiveness of our proposed neighborhood Wasserstein reconstruc-
tion method, we provide detailed results on how well the generated neighbor features can approximate
the real ones in Appendix D. The results show that the method can indeed recover the entire real
neighbor features, and the approximation gets better as we use a larger sampling factor q especially
on larger datasets, while the performances on downstream tasks are already satisfactory even with
smaller q values, allowing the training to be rather efﬁcient."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.4788732394366197,"In this work, we address the limitations of existing unsupervised graph representation methods and
propose the ﬁrst model that can properly capture the proximity, structure and feature information of
nodes in graphs, and discriminatively encode them in the low-dimensional embedding space. The
model is extensively tested on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, and the results
strongly support its claimed advantages. Since it is general, efﬁcient, and also conceptually well-
understood, we believe it to have the potential to serve as the de facto method for unsupervised graph
representation learning. In the future, it will be promising to see its applications studied in different
domains, as well as its potential issues such as robustness and privacy carefully analyzed."

REFERENCES,0.8943661971830986,"Encoder setting. We used the same GCN encoders for almost all baselines because our contribution
in this work is on the decoder and we wanted to be fair and focus on the comparison of different
decoders. Speciﬁcally, we use the default encoders in their original work for all baselines that
involve GNN encoders (GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017a) for GraphCL (You et al., 2020), GCN
(Kipf & Welling, 2017) for GAE (Kipf & Welling, 2016), VGAE (Kipf & Welling, 2016), DGI
(Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018b), MVGRL (You et al., 2020)). The GCN encoders all have the same two-
layer architecture, which is the same as we used for NWR-GAE. In our experiments, we have actually
tried to use other GNNs as the encoders for all methods including NWR-GAE and the baselines, but
found GCN to have the best performance. For example, in the following Table C, we provide the
results of GAE with the GIN (Xu et al., 2019c) and GraphSage (Hamilton et al., 2017a) encoders,
which are clearly worse than that with GCN."

(like a box-plot). As we can observe, our model can get a reasonably good approximation to the
ground-truth neighborhood information (the smaller the better approximation). We tried different
sample sizes q such as 5, 15, 30, which do not make a large difference in the ﬁrst three datasets
since most nodes in the graphs have rather small numbers of neighbors. Our model shows better
approximation power on the neighborhood information with larger sample sizes such as Chameleon
with denser links. However, the performances on downstream tasks are already satisfactory even
with smaller q values (the results we show in Table 2 are with q = 5, and the results we show in
Figure 4 (b) are with q = 5, 10, 15). This indicates that while our model has the ability to more
ideally approximate the entire neighborhood information, it often may not be necessary to guarantee
satisfactory performance in downstream tasks, which allows us to train the model with small sample
sizes and achieve good efﬁciency."

Motivated by such observations and understandings, we set k to 4 for all real-world experiments,
which can empirically capture most important local graph structures, to achieve a good trade-off
between model effectiveness and efﬁciency."
