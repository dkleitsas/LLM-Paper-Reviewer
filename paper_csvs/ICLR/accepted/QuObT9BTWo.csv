ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0018796992481203006,"Multiobjective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems can be found in
many real-world applications. However, exactly solving these problems would be
very challenging, particularly when they are NP-hard. Many handcrafted heuris-
tic methods have been proposed to tackle different MOCO problems over the past
decades. In this work, we generalize the idea of neural combinatorial optimiza-
tion, and develop a learning-based approach to approximate the whole Pareto set
for a given MOCO problem without further search procedure. We propose a single
preference-conditioned model to directly generate approximate Pareto solutions
for any trade-off preference, and design an efficient multiobjective reinforcement
learning algorithm to train this model. Our proposed method can be treated as
a learning-based extension for the widely-used decomposition-based multiobjec-
tive evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D). It uses a single model to accommodate
all the possible preferences, whereas other methods use a finite number of solu-
tions to approximate the Pareto set. Experimental results show that our proposed
method significantly outperforms some other methods on the multiobjective trav-
eling salesman problem, multiobjective vehicle routing problem, and multiobjec-
tive knapsack problem in terms of solution quality, speed, and model efficiency."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.005639097744360902,"Many real-world applications can be modeled as multiobjective combinatorial optimization
(MOCO) problems (Ehrgott & Gandibleux, 2000). Examples include the multiobjective traveling
salesman problem (MOTSP) (Lust & Teghem, 2010a), the multiobjective vehicle routing problem
(MOVRP) (Jozefowiez et al., 2008) and the multiobjective knapsack problem (MOKP) (Bazgan
et al., 2009). These problems have multiple objectives to optimize, and no single solution can op-
timize all the objectives at the same time. Instead, there is a set of Pareto optimal solutions with
different trade-offs among the objectives."
INTRODUCTION,0.007518796992481203,"It is very challenging to find all the exact Pareto optimal solutions for a MOCO problem. Ac-
tually, finding one single Pareto optimal solution can be NP-hard for many problems (Ehrgott &
Gandibleux, 2000), and the number of Pareto solutions could be exponentially large with regard to
the problem size (Ehrgott, 2005; Herzel et al., 2021). The decision-maker’s preference among dif-
ferent objectives is usually unknown in advance, making it very difficult to reduce the problem into
a single-objective one. Over the past several decades, many methods have been developed to find
an approximate Pareto set for different MOCO problems within a reasonable computational time.
These methods often need carefully handcrafted and specialized heuristics for each problem. It can
be very labor-intensive in practice."
INTRODUCTION,0.009398496240601503,"In many real-world applications, practitioners need to solve many different instances for the same
particular problem, where the instances can be easily obtained or generated (Bengio et al., 2020).
It is desirable to learn the patterns behind these problem instances explicitly or implicitly to design
efficient algorithms (Cappart et al., 2021a). Machine learning techniques can be naturally used for
this purpose. Some learning-based methods have been recently proposed for solving single-objective
combinatorial optimization problems (Bengio et al., 2020; Vesselinova et al., 2020; Mazyavkina
et al., 2021; Cappart et al., 2021a). In this work, we extend the learning-based method to solve
MOCO problems in a principled way as shown in Figure 1. Our main contributions include:"

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK"
BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK,0.046992481203007516,"Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO). MOCO has been attracting growing re-
search efforts from different communities over the past several decades (Sawaragi et al., 1985;
Wallenius et al., 2008; Herzel et al., 2021). There are two main approaches to tackle the MOCO
problems: the exact methods and the approximation methods (Ehrgott, 2005). Exact methods could
be prohibitively costly when, as it often happens, the MOCO problem is NP-hard and the prob-
lem size is very large (Florios & Mavrotas, 2014). For this reason, many heuristics (Jaszkiewicz,
2002; Zhang & Li, 2007; Ehrgott & Gandibleux, 2008) and approximation methods (Papadimitriou
& Yannakakis, 2000; Herzel et al., 2021) have been developed to find a manageable number of
approximated Pareto solutions with a reasonable computational budget. However, these methods
usually depend on carefully handcrafted designs for each specific problem (Ehrgott & Gandibleux,
2000), and the required effort is often nontrivial in real-world applications."
BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK,0.04887218045112782,"Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization.
As summarized in Bengio et al. (2020),
there are three main learning-based approaches for combinatorial optimization: learning to config-
ure algorithms (Kruber et al., 2017; Bonami et al., 2018), learning alongside the algorithms (Lodi
& Zarpellon, 2017; Gasse et al., 2019; Chen & Tian, 2019), and learning to directly predict the
solutions (Nowak et al., 2018; Emami & Ranka, 2018; Larsen et al., 2018). Neural combinatorial
optimization (NCO) belongs to the last category where the model directly produces a good solu-
tion for a given problem instance. Vinyals et al. (2015) proposed a pointer network to sequentially
construct a solution for the TSP problem. Bello et al. (2017) made a critical improvement to use re-
inforcement learning to train the model, eliminating the impractical optimal solutions collection for
NP-hard problems. Some other improvements on model structure and training procedure have been
proposed in the past few years (Nazari et al., 2018; Deudon et al., 2018; Kool et al., 2019; Veliˇckovi´c
& Blundell, 2021), especially with graph neural networks (GNNs) (Dai et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018;

problems. Recently, a few attempts have been made to solve MOCO problems (Li et al., 2020; Wu
et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021a;b). These methods adopt the MOEA/D framework (Zhang & Li,
2007) to decompose a MOCO problem into a number of single-objective subproblems, and then
build a set of models to solve each subproblem separately. However, since the number of Pareto
solutions would be exponentially large (Ehrgott, 2005), the required number of models would be
huge for finding the whole Pareto set. In this work, we propose a single preference-conditioned
model for solving MOCO problems, with which the decision makers can easily obtain any trade-off
solutions. The proposed single neural MOCO solver could be much easier to use in a real-world
system (Veliˇckovi´c & Blundell, 2021), than those using a large set of different models."

CURRENT DRAWBACKS AND OUR METHOD"
CURRENT DRAWBACKS AND OUR METHOD,0.10902255639097744,"Drawbacks of Existing Methods. For many MOCO problems, the size of the Pareto set would
be exponentially large with respect to the input size (e.g., nodes in MOTSP). It is computationally
impractical for existing methods to find the whole Pareto set (Herzel et al., 2021). For this reason, all
of the existing heuristic-based and learning-based methods are to find a small subset of approximate
Pareto solutions. Decision makers can only select solutions from this small set, which often does not
contain their preferred solutions. In addition, scalarization may also produce a complicated single
objective subproblem. For example, the Tchebycheff scalarized subproblem of MOTSP is not a
classic TSP, and thus cannot be solved by the highly specialized TSP solvers such as LKH (Helsgaun,
2000) or Concorde (Applegate et al., 2007)."
CURRENT DRAWBACKS AND OUR METHOD,0.11090225563909774,"Our Method. Instead of finding a set of finite solutions, we propose a novel way to approximate
the whole Pareto set using a single model. With our proposed model, decision makers can easily
obtain any solution from the approximate Pareto set to satisfy their preferred trade-offs in real time
as shown in Figure 2. This is a clear advantage to support interactive decision making. In addi-
tion, our proposed reinforcement learning based method can use a scalarization method to combine
multiobjective rewards, and does not need to consider the problem-specific condition. In this paper,
we mainly consider learning the whole Pareto front. It is possible to incorporate decision-maker’s
preferences on specific regions for model building and inference as discussed in Appendix D.6. We
believe our proposed method is a new principled way to solve multiobjective combinatorial opti-
mization problems."

We consider MOTSP (Lust & Teghem, 2010a), MOCVRP (La-
comme et al., 2006) and MOKP (Bazgan et al., 2009) in our experimental studies, and use the same
model settings for all problems with different task-specific input sizes and mask methods. The main
policy model encoder is the Attention Model (Kool et al., 2019) and the hypernetwork is an MLP.
We randomly generate 100, 000 problem instances on the fly for each epoch, and train the model
for 200 epochs. The optimizer is ADAM with learning rate η = 10−4 and weight decay 10−6.
We train our models on a single RTX 2080-Ti GPU, and it costs about 10 minutes for an epoch on
MOTSP100. We give detailed model settings, problem formulations, and more experimental results
in Appendix BCD. The source code can be found in https://github.com/Xi-L/PMOCO."
EXPERIMENTS,0.20112781954887218,"Baseline. We call our proposed preference-conditioned multiobjective combinatorial optimization
as P-MOCO. We compare it with three widely-used evolutionary algorithm frameworks for MOCO:
MOGLS (Jaszkiewicz, 2002) is a multiobjective genetic local search algorithm, NSGAII (Deb
et al., 2002) is a Pareto dominance-based multiobjective genetic algorithm, and MOEA/D (Zhang
& Li, 2007) is a decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. All these algorithm
frameworks need problem-specific heuristics to generate and search feasible solutions for different
problems. We also compare P-MOCO with two other learning-based methods: DRL-MOA (Li
et al., 2020) decomposes a MOCO with different preferences and builds a Pointer Network (Vinyals
et al., 2015; Bello et al., 2017) to solve each subproblem, and AM-MOCO is a multi-models variant
of our proposed model, which builds Attention Model (Kool et al., 2019) for each subproblem. The
Weight-Sum scalarization of MOTSP and MOKP are their respective single-objective counterpart.
Therefore, we also compare our method with the approach that uses some state-of-the-art single-

the performance for each method. For a set P ⊂Rm in the objective space, we can find a reference

instance augmentation, which significantly outperforms other methods but is beaten by the LKH

cannot do. As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 5, our method can successfully learn the mapping from
preferences to the corresponding solutions, and can generate a good prediction to the whole Pareto
front. Decision makers can easily obtain any preferred trade-off solutions as they like. This flexibil-

DP method is also outperformed by our method since the weight-sum scalarization can only find
the convex hull of the Pareto front. The Tchebycheff scalarization of MOKP is not a KP problem,

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.23684210526315788,"Conclusion. We have proposed a novel preference-conditioned method to approximate the whole
Pareto front for MOCO problems using a single model. It allows decision makers to directly ob-
tain any trade-off solutions without any search procedure. Experiments on different problems have
shown that our proposed method significantly outperforms other methods in terms of performance,
speed and model efficiency. We believe the proposed method is a principled way for solving MOCO."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.2387218045112782,"Future Work. In a sense, our method can be regarded as a learning version of the decomposition-
based algorithm (MOEA/D (Zhang & Li, 2007)) dealing with all the possible trade-off preferences.
Instead of maintaining a set of finite solutions as in other MOEA/D vaiants (Trivedi et al., 2016), we
build a single learning-based model to solve the subproblems for all the preferences simultaneously
in a collaborative manner. We believe the single-model-for-all-preference approach is a promising
alternative to the current default finite-population-based methods, and it could be an important re-
search direction for multiobjective optimization. Our method can be further improved with other
advanced models and efficient multiobjective training procedures. In the future, we will study fun-
damental issues of multiobjective optimization (e.g., convergence v.s. diversity, exploitation v.s.
exploration trade-off) for Pareto set learning methods."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.24060150375939848,"Limitation. It is very difficult to give a convergence guarantee for learning-based MOCO, where
each preference-based subproblem could be already NP-hard, and the number of Pareto solutions is
exponentially large with respect to the input size. See detailed discussion in Appendix A."

PARETO SET LEARNING AND CONVERGENCE GUARANTEE"
REFERENCES,0.4323308270676692,"In this work, we have proposed a novel neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) method to approx-
imate the whole Pareto set for MOCO problems with a single model. The proposed learning-based
MOCO solver can directly generate arbitrary trade-off solutions without extra optimization. We
believe it is a principled way to solve MOCO problems."
REFERENCES,0.4342105263157895,"However, the lack of an exact optimality guarantee is a limitation of the proposed method, which is
also the case for previous work on single-objective neural combinatorial optimization (Vinyals et al.,
2015; Bello et al., 2017; Kool et al., 2019). This limitation is mainly due to the fact that many single-
objective combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are NP-hard, and the size of Pareto sets for a
MOCO problem would be exponentially huge, which makes it very difficult to exactly solving the
problems (Ehrgott, 2005; Herzel et al., 2021). In addition, the training for the parameterized policy
(neural network model) cannot guarantee to fit all training problems perfectly. The generalization
ability to problem instances with different patterns (out-of-distribution generalization) is another
critical issue that makes it difficult to give an exact optimality guarantee to the proposed learning-
based algorithm."
REFERENCES,0.43609022556390975,"On the other hand, our proposed model is an efficient mapping from the preferences to the corre-
sponding approximate set of the Pareto optimal solutions. It provides a flexible way for decision
makers to obtain an approximate solution with their preferred trade-off directly. The experimental
results also show that our proposed method can generate good approximate Pareto sets for three
different MOCO problems. In the next subsection, we provide a thorough discussion on the approx-
imation ability of our proposed method."

preference-based scalarization methods and decomposition methods (Choo & Atkins, 1983; Zhang

us to tackle the problem in a systematic manner. In this work, we propose to approximately solve

transfer training and the non-uniform Pareto front. Increasing the training steps for fine-tuning each
model might fix this issue, but will lead to an even larger computational overhead, given the current
training already require 700 epochs. The fixed preferences assignment is another issue for MA-
MOCO. It requires a fixed set of preferences for each model at the start of the training procedure

this work. Since the shape of Pareto front tends to be irregular for real-world applications (Ishibuchi
et al., 2019), how to properly choose the aggregation function and assign the preference distribution
could be an important future work."

Our proposed approach allows the user to generate arbitrary trade-off Pareto solutions on the infer-
ence time, therefore they can directly generate a dense approximation and then select the preferred
solutions as in Figure 9(d). This flexibility can partially address the unevenly distributed issues
caused by a (small) set of fixed weights in the traditional scalarization-based approach."

into [0, 1] to encourage a more symmetric Pareto front. Otherwise, on the inference time, we can
use a (prior knowledge-based) biased and non-uniform weight assignment to generate uniformly
distributed solutions. In Figure 9(e)-(h), we first multiple the three-dimensional weights by (1, 2, 10)
and then normalize them back to [0, 1]3 which leads to a set of non-uniform weights as shown in
Figure 9(e). With this weight assignment, we have a a set of more evenly distributed Pareto solutions
