ABSTRACT,0.002074688796680498,"Heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) enables clients with different compu-
tation/communication capabilities to collaboratively train their own customized
models, in which the knowledge of models is shared via clients’ predictions on
an auxiliary unlabeled dataset.
However, there are two major limitations: 1)
The assumption of auxiliary datasets may be unrealistic for data-critical scenarios
such as Healthcare and Finance. 2) HFL is vulnerable to various privacy viola-
tions since the samples and predictions are completely exposed to adversaries. In
this work, we develop PrivHFL, a general and practical framework for privacy-
preserving HFL. We bypass the limitation of auxiliary datasets by designing a
simple yet effective dataset expansion method. The main insight is that expanded
data could provide good coverage of natural distributions, which is conducive to
the sharing of model knowledge. To further tackle the privacy issue, we exploit the
lightweight additive secret sharing technique to construct a series of tailored cryp-
tographic protocols for key building blocks, such as secure prediction. Our pro-
tocols implement ciphertext operations through simple vectorized computations,
which are friendly with GPUs and can be processed by highly-optimized CUDA
kernels. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PrivHFL outperforms prior art up
to two orders of magnitude in efﬁciency and realizes signiﬁcant accuracy gains on
top of the stand-alone method."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.006224066390041493,"Heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) (Li & Wang, 2019; Chang et al., 2019), as a promising
variant of federated learning (FL), enables clients equipped with different computation and commu-
nication capabilities to collaboratively train their own customized models that may differ in size, nu-
merical precision or structure (Lin et al., 2020). In particular, clients share the knowledge of models
via their predictions on auxiliary datasets, such as unlabeled problem domain datasets (Choquette-
Choo et al., 2021) and public non-problem domain datasets (Li & Wang, 2019; Lin et al., 2020).
This ﬂexible approach facilitates customized FL-driven services in areas like Healthcare and Fi-
nance (Kairouz et al., 2019), while solving the intellectual property concerns of FL models (Atli
et al., 2020). However, HFL suffers from two major limitations: (1) The assumption of auxiliary
datasets may be unrealistic for many data-critical scenarios (Zhu et al., 2021). For example, in
Healthcare applications, task-related auxiliary datasets that contain patients’ sensitive information
are usually difﬁcult to obtain due to current strict regulations like General Data Protection Regula-
tion. (2) Sharing predictions may still leak the privacy of local data (Papernot et al., 2017). Several
works have demonstrated that given the black-box access to a trained model, adversaries can infer
membership (Salem et al., 2019) and attribute information (Ganju et al., 2018) of the target sample,
and even can reconstruct the original training data (Yang et al., 2019). Therefore, to promote the
deployment of HFL in real-world applications, it is crucial to solve the above two problems."
INTRODUCTION,0.008298755186721992,"To the best of our knowledge, in HFL the relaxation of the auxiliary dataset assumption has not been
explored before. Speciﬁcally, it is challenging to achieve collaborative training under heterogeneous
models when there is no an auxiliary dataset as a medium for the model knowledge transfer (Li &
Wang, 2019). On the other hand, to mitigate the above privacy risks, a natural solution is to integrate
advanced secure prediction protocols, such as CrypTFlow2 (Rathee et al., 2020), CryptGPU (Tan
et al., 2021), and HE-transformer (Boemer et al., 2019b). These schemes can protect the private in-
formation during the model knowledge transfer by utilizing homomorphic encryption (HE) (Gentry,"

(refer to Appendix D.2 for more details). Unfortunately, such methods add huge computation and
communication overhead due to the use of heavy cryptographic primitives. For instance, Choquette-
Choo et al. (2021) recently proposed CaPC, the ﬁrst private collaborative learning scheme based
on HE-transformer (Boemer et al., 2019b) supporting heterogeneous models, which can be directly
extended to HFL. As mentioned above, this work still suffers from efﬁciency issues, inherited from
prior secure prediction protocols. Moreover, their scheme is implemented by the interaction between
clients1, however in real-world applications, clients (e.g., mobile devices) generally cannot establish
direct communication channels with others (Bonawitz et al., 2017). Therefore, the challenge here is
how to efﬁciently implement secure prediction protocols in the realistic HFL setting."
INTRODUCTION,0.014522821576763486,"In this work, to approach the above challenges, we develop PrivHFL, a general and practical frame-
work for privacy-preserving HFL. First, PrivHFL relaxes the assumption of dependence on auxil-
iary datasets and designs a simple but effective dataset expansion method only with clients’ private
datasets. To this end, we instantiate it by leveraging mixup (Zhang et al., 2018) that is originally
a regularization technique to improve generalization, and also present some exploration with other
data augmentation methods like cutout (DeVries & Taylor, 2017) and cutmix (Yun et al., 2019).
The key idea is that the expanded data could provide good coverage of natural dataset distributions
and hence could be used as an effective medium for transferring model knowledge. Second, to se-
curely and efﬁciently evaluate HFL, we leverage the lightweight additive secret sharing technique
(Demmler et al., 2015) to construct customized secure prediction protocols from scratch in a practi-
cal setting where there is no direct communication between clients. Our gains mainly come from the
improvement in communication and computation through the elimination of costly HE and GC pro-
tocols. Moreover, in contrast to prior works that evaluate cryptographic protocols in CPUs, PrivHFL
converts complex cryptographic operations to simple computations on large blocks of data, which
are friendly with GPUs and can be processed by highly-optimized CUDA kernels (Tan et al., 2021).
As a result, PrivHFL is suitable for the batch prediction (i.e., performing multiple predictions at the
same time) with lower amortized cost. We evaluate the designed protocol on GPUs and CPUs, and
the results show that our GPU-based protocol is up to 10× faster than its CPU analog. Our key
contributions can be summarized as follows:"

own unique models, but due to the model heterogeneity, they cannot directly share model param-
eters with each other. Instead, they learn the knowledge of other models via the predictions on a
task-related auxiliary dataset, where a server routes messages between the clients since they gener-
ally cannot establish direct communication channels with others (Bonawitz et al., 2017; Bell et al.,
2020). Speciﬁcally, clients ﬁrst train local models with their own private datasets. Then, each client
performs prediction on the auxiliary dataset based on the local model and sends the prediction re-
sults to the server to aggregate. Later, the server broadcasts aggregated results to clients, which will
retrain local models based on the auxiliary dataset and received predictions. The whole process is"

infer more knowledge about other clients’ private information such as model parameters and private
datasets. Moreover, to maintain the reputation and provide more services, the server does not collude
with any clients. Formally, an attacker either corrupts the server or a subset of clients but not both.
This setting is reasonable and has been widely instantiated in previous works (Phong et al., 2018;

ization and the efﬁciency of knowledge distillation (Wang et al., 2020). Speciﬁcally, we repurpose
mixup to construct a big synthesized pool on the small private dataset, which could provide a good
coverage of the manifold of natural samples. Given any two private samples xi and xj, we generate
multiple synthetic query samples by a convex combination with different coefﬁcients λ as follows:"

We also explore the inﬂuence of different λ values in Appendix B.3 and Table 5. This simple method
can exponentially expand the size of initial dataset and hence provide more candidate samples for
query. Following CaPC (Choquette-Choo et al., 2021), we use random sampling and active learning
strategies (Tong & Koller, 2001) in Appendix C.3 to select informative samples from the synthesized
pool. Note that an alternative solution is to directly use private datasets to query like knowledge

and model parameters, we design a secure querying protocol by exploiting the lightweight additive
secret sharing technique, rather than heavy HE and GC techniques. Recall that in our querying
protocol, three entities are included, i.e., the server, PQ and PA. The challenge here is how to
efﬁciently implement such protocol under strict communication constraints, i.e., the communication
channels cannot be established among clients. To tackle this challenge, the key idea is to outsource
the secure querying task to the server and PA, and then design a PQ-assisted customized protocol
to accelerate the evaluation. Moreover, an important design principle is to conduct a GPU-friendly
protocol that mainly includes vectorized operations and hence is suitable for batch prediction with
better amortized costs. In the following, we decompose our scheme into three steps: query-data

server compute matrix multiplication ωx, where the model parameter ω is held by PA and the input
x is secret-shared between PA and the server. Given that ωx = ω[x]0 + ω[x]1, PA can compute
ω[x]0 locally. As shown in Figure 3, we design an efﬁcient protocol ΠMatmul for evaluating ω[x]1.
In particular, PQ ﬁrst generates three random matrices a, b and [c]0 using PRGs, and computes [c]1
that satisﬁes [c]1 + [c]0 = a · b. Accordingly, the server can generate the same b using PRGs based
on SkSQ, and PA obtains a and [c]0 using PRGs based on SkQA. (a, b, c) is the Beaver’s triple
with the constrain c = ab to mask the inputs of PA and the server. Later, the server and PA call the
Beaver’s multiplication protocol in Appendix C.4.1 to jointly compute [y]1 and [y]0, i.e., the secret

namely that it equals 1 if x ≥0 and 0 otherwise. Since the multiplication of x and DReLU(x)
can be implemented by the protocol ΠMatmul, we mainly focus on the evaluation of DReLU(x), i.e.,
sign(x). The insight is to convert the calculation of sign(x) to the calculation of sign(r · x) where r
is a random positive number. Based on the above observation, we design a secure DReLU protocol
ΠDReLU as shown in Figure 4. In detail, PA and the server ﬁrst generate a random positive value r
using PRGs with SkSA, and compute [z] = r[x] locally. Then they send the secret-shared value [z]
to PQ. Note that since r is randomly generated, the value of r · x is also a random number in the
domain. Similar ideas are also applied to other privacy-preserving machine learning works (Wagh

Our protocols mainly consists of GPU-friendly vectorized secret-sharing,
which can be processed by highly-optimized CUDA kernels. However, for multiplication opera-
tions, existing CUDA kernels are designed to operate on ﬂoating-point inputs. In PrivHFL, we
typically compute over integer values. To leverage optimized kernels for protocol acceleration,
our PrivHFL integrates the CUDALongTensor abstract in CryptGPU (Tan et al., 2021) that embeds
the integer-valued cryptographic operations into ﬂoating-point arithmetic (refer to Appendix C.6
for more details). However, CryptGPU’s protocols cannot be directly extended to PrivHFL in the
communication-limited scenario, and hence we redesign all cryptographic protocols from scratch."

reveals zero information to PA and the server, and only reveals the ﬁnal aggregated prediction to

anything about the query data of querying parties, while the conﬁdentiality of answering parties’
model parameters against corrupted PQ is also protected."

deep learning domain (Papernot et al., 2017; Sun & Lyu, 2021; Choquette-Choo et al., 2021), this
is non-trivial to design a customized DP mechanism for HFL, because the privacy-utility tradeoff is
difﬁcult to resolve. Especially, the privacy guarantee will deteriorate with the increase of corrupted
clients, unless it is mitigated by adding more DP noises at the cost of accuracy. In our setting, we
assume up to n −1 (n is the number of clients) clients can be corrupted such that the above problem
will be escalated to the worst case. Therefore, it is an interesting and challenging work to design a
high-utility DP mechanism in the distributed scenario where multiple clients may be corrupted."

HETEROGENEOUS FEDERATED LEARNING"
REFERENCES,0.47717842323651455,"In federated learning (FL), multiple clients collectively learn a single model with a ﬁxed architecture,
in which each client maintains a local model for the private dataset, while the server maintains a
global model via aggregating the local model gradients from clients. Although successful, FL is
often restrictive in practice, since it assumes all clients sharing the same model architecture. To
tackle this problem, heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) is proposed, which enables clients to
collaboratively train their own customized models that may differ in size or structure. Due to the
heterogeneity in local models among clients, it’s not possible to collaborate via sharing gradients
like FL. As shown in Figure 9, generally, HFL uses a task-related auxiliary dataset to assist in
collaborative learning. To be speciﬁc, each client ﬁrst trains the local model with individual private
dataset and then performs inference on the auxiliary dataset to obtain the prediction results, which
are sent to the server to aggregate, rather than the local model gradients. Then, the server broadcasts
the aggregated results to clients, and the clients will retrain local models based on the auxiliary
dataset and the received predictions."

in Section 3.2. To explore the effectiveness of the mixup-based datset expansion method, we vi-
sualize the feature distribution of original data and synthetic samples on SVHN and CIFAR10. As
shown in Figure 11(a) and Figure 11(b), the synthetic samples cover a larger part of the feature
space and hence they should be more diverse and informative compared with original data. In other
words, it could provide a good coverage of the manifold of natural samples. Therefore, learning the
predictions from other clients on the synthetic samples can further improve the accuracy of local
models."

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS FOR SECURE PREDICTION"
REFERENCES,0.5394190871369294,"In the model querying phase, we leverage the GPU parallelism to process private querying on a
batch of images, which effectively amortize the cost of private inference. In Table 4, we compare our
GPU-friendly method on MNIST using the three model architectures (CryptoNets (Gilad-Bachrach
et al., 2016), CryptoNets-ReLU (Gilad-Bachrach et al., 2016) and MLP (Boemer et al., 2019b))
with HE-Transformer, which also achieves batch-axis packing for private inference. Note that CaPC
(Choquette-Choo et al., 2021) also adopt HE-Transformer as the building block. We can observe that
PrivHFL is up to three orders of magnitude faster than HE-Transformer on the CryptoNets-ReLU
and MLP models. The main reason is the efﬁciency of the protocol and the parallelism supported
by the GPU. However, when evaluating CryptoNets that replaces ReLU activations with squared
approximation, the improvement from PrivHFL will gradually decrease as the batch size increases,
because the HE-based method does not require communication during the entire evaluation pro-
cess. Note that approximations result in signiﬁcant accuracy losses and degrades user experience,
especially when evaluating modern large-scale models."

operations ω1·x (ω1 is the parameter of this layer) and can be implemented by the protocol ΠMatmul in
Figure 3. The outputs of this layer are in the secret sharing form, i.e., [y1]0 and [y1]1 obtained by PA

[DReLU(y1)]1. Then, PA and the server invoke an instance of the protocol ΠMatmul, and obtain
[y2]0 and [y2]1, respectively. The outputs of ΠDReLU are the inputs of the subsequent MaxPooling

EXTENDING CAPC TO COMMUNICATION-LIMITED SETTINGS"
REFERENCES,0.8568464730290456,"By carefully designing protocols, CaPC (Choquette-Choo et al., 2021) can also be extended to a
setting where there is no direct communication between clients. However, as analyzed below, such
extension comes at the cost of increased communication overhead. Therefore, our PrivHFL has
greater advantages compared to the following modiﬁed protocols."
REFERENCES,0.8589211618257261,"Recall that HE-Transformer (Boemer et al., 2019b;a) provides two secure prediction schemes, i.e., a
pure HE-based scheme and a hybrid scheme combining HE and GC. Given that the HE-Transformer
framework is employed in CaPC, we design two customized protocols for HE-Transformer to
achieve such communication requirement. Although it is trivial to extend CaPC equipped with the
HE-based scheme to the above communication-limited settings, it has two key problems: 1) activa-
tion functions need to be approximated as low-degree polynomials, which leads to serious accuracy
loss; 2) due to the inherent high computational complexity, HE-based secure prediction is difﬁcult
to extend to large-scale models. For completeness, we brieﬂy describe the extension procedure. PQ
ﬁrst encrypts the query samples and asks the server to pass them to PA. After that, PA evaluates se-
cure prediction non-interactively in the ciphertext environment. Finally, PA sends encrypted masked
predictions (due to privacy-preserving aggregation in CaPC) back to PQ via the server acting as a
intermediary. As mentioned above, the HE-based method is impractical and below, we elaborate on
the extension of CaPC that uses the hybrid scheme as a building block. In CaPC, secure predictions
are executed between PQ and PA. To tackle the communication limitation, we can employ secure
predictions between the server and PA. We discuss the modiﬁed algorithms of the linear layer and
the non-linear layer separately. In the linear layer, 1) PQ encrypts query samples with HE and sends
the ciphertext to PA through the server5. 2) PA evaluates linear layers locally, such as convolution
and full-connected layers, and returns the encrypted masked results to PQ through the server. 3)
PQ decrypts to obtain the masked results and sends it to the server. As a result, the results of linear
layers are shared between the server and PA. For the non-linear layer, given that the server and PA
hold shares of the linear layer’s results, the two parties (rather than PA and PQ in CaPC) call the GC
protocol to evaluate the nonlinear layer function."
REFERENCES,0.8609958506224067,"Next, we analyze the efﬁciency of the modiﬁed hybrid protocols. For the computational cost, the
modiﬁed secure prediction protocol is exactly the same as that of CaPC, and thus we mainly focus on
the communication cost. In the linear layer, the modiﬁed protocol adds the communication overhead
of a ciphertext (two ciphertexts for the input layer) and a plaintext of the result of the linear layer.
For the non-linear layer, the communication overhead is not increased, but the overhead between PA
and PQ is transferred to the server and PA. In summary, although CaPC can be extended to scenarios
with limited communication, they sacriﬁce the efﬁciency of secure predictions. Therefore, PrivHFL
shows better adaptability and efﬁciency in scenarios where there is no direct communication between
clients."

HETEROGENEOUS FEDERATED LEARNING"
REFERENCES,0.8941908713692946,"Federated learning achieves collaboration among clients via sharing model gradients. While suc-
cessful, it still faces many challenges, among which, of particular importance is the heterogeneity
that appear in all aspects of the learning process. This consists of system heterogeneity (Diao et al.,
2021), model heterogeneity (Li & Wang, 2019) and statistical heterogeneity (Zhu et al., 2021).
Statistical heterogeneity means that clients’ data from real-world comes from distinct distributions
(i.e., Non-IID data), which may induce deﬂected local optimum. Solving the statistical heterogene-
ity has been extensively studied, such as Dinh et al. (2020); Zhu et al. (2021); Yurochkin et al.
(2019); Fallah et al. (2020); Yoon et al. (2021)6, and is out-of-the-scope of this work. However,
our PrivHFL may help alleviate the statistical heterogeneity due to customized model design and
knowledge distillation-based aggregation rule."
REFERENCES,0.8962655601659751,"Our work mainly focuses on model heterogeneity that has been explored in recent works (Li &
Wang, 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Choquette-Choo et al., 2021), while the issue of system heterogeneous
is alleviated through the resource-customized model architecture design. In particular, Li & Wang
(2019) proposed the ﬁrst federated learning framework FedMD supporting heterogeneous models by
combining transfer learning and knowledge distillation techniques. They ﬁrst used a public dataset
to pre-train the model and transferred to the task of private dataset. After that, to exchange the
knowledge, each client used the public data and the aggregated predictions from others as carrier
for knowledge distillation. To further improve test accuracy, Lin et al. (Lin et al., 2020) proposed
FedDF, similar to FedMD, which also used model distillation technique for knowledge sharing. The
difference is that they ﬁrst performed FedAvg on clients’ local models and integrated knowledge
distillation on the aggregated model. The dependence on model averaging leads to limited model
heterogeneity. Besides, Diao et al. (Diao et al., 2021) focused on heterogeneous clients equipped
with different computation and communication capabilities. In their framework, each client only
updated a subset of global model parameters through varying the width of hidden channels, which
reduces the computation and communication complexity of local models. However, this approach
only learns a single global model, rather than unique models designed by clients. Moreover, the
above three methods rarely consider the issue of privacy leakage from the prediction results."

guarantee each client’s privacy. However, as shown in Jayaraman & Evans (2019), there is a huge
gap between the upper bounds on privacy loss analyzed by advanced mechanisms and the effective
privacy loss. Thus, differentially private mechanisms offer undesirable utility-privacy trade-offs.
To further formally guarantee the privacy, Choquette-Choo et al. (2021) leveraged secure multi-
party computation (MPC), homomorphic encryption (HE) and privately aggregated teacher models
techniques to realize conﬁdential and private collaborative learning. Speciﬁcally, clients learn from
each other collaboratively utilizing a secure inference strategy based on MPC and HE protocols
and a private aggregation method. As noted in the Introduction, CaPC’s use of heavy cryptography
leads to signiﬁcant efﬁciency and communication overheads. Besides, existing methods require an
auxiliary dataset to implement heterogeneous federated learning. However, data collection could
be unrealistic in many real-world scenarios due to various reasons, such as privacy concerns and
rare classes. Therefore, our work is dedicated to solving two key challenges. The ﬁrst is to relax
the assumption of relying on public datasets, and the second is to design an efﬁcient cryptographic
protocol for knowledge transfer during the model aggregation."

PRIVATE NEURAL NETWORK PREDICTION"
REFERENCES,0.9087136929460581,"Neural networks present a challenge to cryptographic protocols due to their unique structure and ex-
ploitative combination of linear computations and non-linear activation functions. In real scenarios,
model inference can be viewed as a two-party computation case, where one party with private data
wants to obtain prediction results from the other party who owns the model. During the whole pro-
cess, the cryptographic protocols, typically HE and MPC, are applied to ensure the conﬁdentiality
of the private data and model."
REFERENCES,0.9107883817427386,"Existing works (Boemer et al., 2019b; Gilad-Bachrach et al., 2016; Brutzkus et al., 2019) support
pure HE protocols for secure predictions. Typically, nGraph-HE (Boemer et al., 2019b;a) allows
linear computations using CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme.
However, since a solution
that builds upon HE protocols should be restricted to compute low degree polynomials, the non-
polynomial activation functions, such as MaxPooling and ReLU, are forced to be evaluated in the
clear by the party who owns private query data. This leaks the feature maps, from which adversaries
may deduce the model weights. To solve this problem, Gilad-Bachrach et al. (2016) and Chen et al.
(2019) use low-degree polynomial approximation to estimate non-linear functions. Unfortunately, it
will affect the accuracy of predictions, while leading to huge computation overhead."

Shen et al., 2020) employ primarily MPC technology in secure predictions, which provides support
for linear and non-linear activations through the use of oblivious transfer (OT), garbled circuit (GC)
and secret sharing. For example, CryptTen (Knott et al., 2021) performs linear operations based on
n-out-of-n additive secret sharing over the ring, Z264. However, it uses boolean secret sharing for
the non-linear operations, which will result in a higher communication round. CrpytGPU (Tan et al.,
2021) builds on CrypTen, working in a 3-party setting using replicated secret shares. Although
the scalability is poor, it introduces an interface to losslessly embed cryptographic operations over
secret-shared values in a discrete somain into ﬂoating-point operations, which can implement the
whole inference process on the GPU."
REFERENCES,0.9149377593360996,"Many other works focus on hybrid protocols, in which they combines the advantages of HE and
MPC to improve prediction efﬁciency (Juvekar et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2020; Rathee et al., 2020).
CrypTFlow2 (Rathee et al., 2020) points out that currently, it was not clear whether HE-based linear
operations would provide the best latency. Therefore, the authors implement two class of protocols,
HE-based and OT-based, for linear operations. For non-linear layers, they also design efﬁcient
protocols based on OT. It turns out that in a WAN setting, HE-based inference is always faster and
in a LAN setting OT and HE are incomparable. HE-transformer employs nGraph-HE for evaluation
of linear operations, and ABY framework (Demmler et al., 2015) for GC to evaluate non-linear
functions. Since non-linear operations cannot be parallelized between query data, GC is inefﬁcient,
especially for large networks with thousands of parameters. In contrast, our PrivHFL avoids the use
of heavy cryptographic tools, and only employs additive secret sharing to achieve high efﬁciency,
conﬁdentiality and practicability."

SECURITY ANALYSIS"

access to a ideal functionality. When a protocol invokes another sub-protocol, we use F-hybrid
model for security proof by replacing the sub-protocol with the corresponding functionality. Note

responding to the protocol PRG. The executions in both worlds are coordinated by the environment
