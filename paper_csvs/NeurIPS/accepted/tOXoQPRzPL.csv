ABSTRACT,0.030303030303030304,"Recent advancements in generative models have highlighted the crucial role of
image tokenization in the efficient synthesis of high-resolution images. Tokeniza-
tion, which transforms images into latent representations, reduces computational
demands compared to directly processing pixels and enhances the effectiveness
and efficiency of the generation process. Prior methods, such as VQGAN, typically
utilize 2D latent grids with fixed downsampling factors. However, these 2D tok-
enizations face challenges in managing the inherent redundancies present in images,
where adjacent regions frequently display similarities. To overcome this issue,
we introduce Transformer-based 1-Dimensional Tokenizer (TiTok), an innovative
approach that tokenizes images into 1D latent sequences. TiTok provides a more
compact latent representation, yielding substantially more efficient and effective
representations than conventional techniques. For example, a 256 × 256 × 3 image
can be reduced to just 32 discrete tokens, a significant reduction from the 256 or
1024 tokens obtained by prior methods. Despite its compact nature, TiTok achieves
competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, using the
same generator framework, TiTok attains 1.97 gFID, outperforming MaskGIT
baseline significantly by 4.21 at ImageNet 256 × 256 benchmark. The advantages
of TiTok become even more significant when it comes to higher resolution. At
ImageNet 512 × 512 benchmark, TiTok not only outperforms state-of-the-art dif-
fusion model DiT-XL/2 (gFID 2.74 vs. 3.04), but also reduces the image tokens
by 64×, leading to 410× faster generation process. Our best-performing variant
can significantly surpass DiT-XL/2 (gFID 2.13 vs. 3.04) while still generating
high-quality samples 74× faster."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.03535353535353535,"In recent years, image generation has experienced remarkable progress, driven by the significant
advancements in both transformers [19, 65, 70, 10, 71, 72] and diffusion models [16, 58, 29, 52, 21].
Mirroring the trends in generative language models [51, 62], the architecture of many contemporary
image generation models incorporate a standard image tokenizer and de-tokenizer. This array of
models utilizes tokenized image representations—ranging from continuous [35] to discrete vec-
tors [57, 64, 19]—to perform a critical function: translating raw pixels into a latent space. The latent
space (e.g., 32 × 32) is significantly more compact than the original image space (256 × 256 × 3). It
offers a compressed yet expressive representation, and thus not only facilitates efficient training and
inference of generative models but also paves the way to scale up the model size."
INTRODUCTION,0.03787878787878788,"Although image tokenizers achieve great success in image generation workflows, they encounter a
fundamental limitation tied to their intrinsic design. These tokenizers are based on an assumption
that the latent space should retain a 2D structure, to maintain a direct mapping for locations between
the latent tokens and image patches. For example, the top-left latent token directly corresponds to
the top-left image patch. This restricts the tokenizer’s ability to effectively leverage the redundancy
inherent in images to cultivate a more compressed latent space."
INTRODUCTION,0.04040404040404041,"Taking one step back, we raise the question “is 2D structure necessary for image tokenization?”
To answer the question, we draw inspiration from several image understanding tasks where model
predictions are based solely on high-level information extracted from input images —such as in
image classification [17], object detection [8, 81], segmentation [67, 34, 74, 75], and multi-modal
large language models [1, 41, 11]. These tasks do not need de-tokenizers, since the outputs typically
manifest in specific structures other than images. In other words, they often format a higher-level
1D sequence as output that can still capture all task-relevant information. Prior arts, such as object
queries [8, 67] or the perceiver resampler [1], encode images into a 1D sequence of a predetermined
number of tokens (e.g., 64). These tokens facilitate the generation of outputs like bounding boxes or
captions. The success of these methods motivates us to investigate a more compact 1D sequence as
image latent representation in the context of image reconstruction and generation. It is noteworthy that
the synthesis of both high-level and low-level information is crucial for the generation of high-quality
images, providing a challenge for extremely compact latent representations."
INTRODUCTION,0.04292929292929293,"In this work, we introduce a transformer-based framework [65, 17] designed to tokenize an image
to a 1D discrete sequence, which can later be decoded back to the image space via a de-tokenizer.
Specifically, we present Transformer-based 1-Dimensional Tokenizer (TiTok), consisting of a Vision
Transformer (ViT) encoder, a ViT decoder, and a vector quantizer following the typical Vector-
Quantized (VQ) model designs [19]. In the tokenization phase, the image is split and flattened into a
series of patches, followed by concatenation with a 1D sequence of latent tokens. After the feature
encoding process of ViT encoder, these latent tokens build the latent representation of the image.
Subsequent to the vector quantization step [64, 19], the ViT decoder reconstructs the input images
from the masked token sequence [15, 24]."
INTRODUCTION,0.045454545454545456,"Building upon TiTok, we conduct extensive experiments to probe the dynamics of 1D image tokeniza-
tion. Our investigation studies the interplay between latent space size, model size, reconstruction
fidelity, and generative quality. From this exploration, several compelling insights emerge:"
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF LATENT TOKENS REPRESENTING AN IMAGE CONSISTENTLY IMPROVES THE,0.047979797979797977,"1. Increasing the number of latent tokens representing an image consistently improves the
reconstruction performance, yet the benefit becomes marginal after 128 tokens. Intriguingly,
32 tokens are sufficient for a reasonable image reconstruction."

tion and generation, especially when number of tokens is limited (e.g., 32 or 64), showcasing
a promising pathway towards a compact image representation at latent space."
SCALING UP THE TOKENIZER MODEL SIZE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PERFORMANCE OF BOTH RECONSTRUC-,0.05303030303030303,"3. 1D tokenization breaks the grid constraints in prior 2D image tokenizers, which not only
enables each latent token to reconstruct regions beyond a fixed image grid and leads to a
more flexible tokenizer design, but also learns more high-level and semantic-rich image
information, especially at a compact latent space."

is demonstrated to facilitate state-of-the-art performance in image generation, while requiring latent
spaces that are 8× to 64× smaller, resulting in significant accelerations during both the training and

RELATED WORK,0.11868686868686869,"Image Tokenization. Images have been compressed since the early days of deep learning with
autoencoders [27, 66]. The general design of using an encoder that compresses high-dimensional
images into a low-dimensional latent representation and then using a decoder to reverse the process,
has proven to be successful over the years. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [35] extend the paradigm
by learning to map the input to a distribution. Instead of modeling a continuous distribution, VQ-
VAEs [50, 56] learn a discrete representation forming a categorical distribution. VQGAN [19] further
improves the training process by using adversarial training [23]. The transformer design of the
autoencoder is further explored in ViT-VQGAN [69] and Efficient-VQGAN [7]. Orthogonal to this,
RQ-VAE [37] and MoVQ [80] study the effect of using multiple vector quantization steps per latent
embedding, while MAGVIT-v2 [72] and FSQ [48] propose a lookup-free quantization. However,
all aforementioned works share the same workflow of an image always being patchwise encoded
into a 2D grid latent representation. In this work, we explore an innovative 1D sequence latent
representation for image reconstruction and generation."

tion [17], object detection [8, 81, 78], segmentation [67, 74, 76], and Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) [1, 41, 77]), it is common to use a general feature encoder instead of an autoen-
coder to tokenize the image. Specifically, many MLLMs [41, 43, 61, 32, 22, 11] uses a CLIP [54]
encoder to tokenize the image into highly semantic tokens, which proves effective for image cap-
tioning [13] and VQA [2]. Some MLLMs also explore discrete tokens [32, 22] or “de-tokenize” the
CLIP embeddings back to images through diffusion models [61, 32, 22]. However, due to the nature
of CLIP models that focus on high-level information, these methods can only reconstruct an image
with high-level semantic similarities (i.e., the layouts and details are not well-reconstructed due to
CLIP features). Therefore, our method is significantly different from theirs, since the proposed TiTok
aims to reconstruct both the high-level and low-level details of an image, same as typical VQ-VAE
tokenizers [35, 57, 19]."

for masked tokens will be sampled based on the prediction confidence, which are then used to update
the masked images. In this way, the image is “progressively generated” from a sequence full of

experimental setup for the proposed TiTok presents a substantial challenge, especially when the target
is a compact 1D tokenization which was rarely studied in literature."
TWO-STAGE TRAINING OF TITOK WITH PROXY CODES,0.25757575757575757,"Two-Stage Training Comes to the Rescue. Although training TiTok with the typical Taming-
VQGAN [19] setting is feasible, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm for an improved
performance. The two-stage training strategy contains “warm-up” and “decoder fine-tuning” stages.
Specifically, in the first “warm-up” stage, instead of directly regressing the RGB values and employing
a variety of loss functions (as in existing methods), we propose to train 1D VQ models with the discrete
codes generated by an off-the-shelf MaskGIT-VQGAN model, which we refer to as proxy codes. This
approach allows us to bypass the intricate loss functions and GAN architectures, thereby concentrating
our efforts on optimizing the 1D tokenization settings. Importantly, this modification does not harm
the functionality of the tokenizer and quantizer within TiTok, which can still fully function for image
tokeniztion and de-tokenization; the main adaptation simply involves the processing of TiTok’s
de-tokenizer output. Specifically, this output, comprising a set of proxy codes, is subsequently fed
into the same off-the-shelf VQGAN decoder to generate the final RGB outputs. It is noteworthy that
the introduction of proxy codes differs from a simple distillation [26]. As verified in our experiments,
TiTok yields significantly better generation performance than MaskGIT-VQGAN."
TWO-STAGE TRAINING OF TITOK WITH PROXY CODES,0.2601010101010101,"After the first training stage with proxy codes, we optionally have the second “decoder fine-tuning”
stage, inspired by [10, 53], to improve the reconstruction quality. Specifically, we keep the encoder
and quantizer frozen, and only train the decoder towards pixel space with the typical VQGAN training
recipe [19]. We observe that such a two-stage training strategy significantly improves the training
stability and reconstructed image quality, as shown in the experiments."

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS,0.32575757575757575,"75% in MAE [24]) to expedite the training process without negatively affecting performance. This
strategy has been validated across a variety of computer vision tasks that rely on high-level image
features [30, 42]. However, the efficacy of such approaches in the context of image reconstruction
and generation—where both low-level and high-level details are crucial for creating realistic recon-
structed and generated outputs—remains underexplored. Consequently, in this experiment, we aim to
determine the minimum number of tokens required to reconstruct and generate high-quality images.
As depicted in Fig. 4a, although model performance progressively improves with an increase in the
number of latent tokens, significant enhancements are predominantly observed when K ranges from
16 to 128. Beyond this point, increasing the latent space size yields only marginal gains. Intriguingly,
we find that with merely 32 latent tokens, TiTok-L achieves performance better than a 2D VQGAN
model [19] using 256 tokens. This observation suggests that as few as 32 tokens may suffice as an
effective image latent representation, optimizing the utilization of image redundancy."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS,0.3282828282828283,"Scaling Up Tokenizer Enables More Compact Latent Size. Another intriguing observation from
Fig. 4a is that larger tokenizers facilitate more compact representations. Specifically, TiTok-B with 64
latent tokens achieves performance comparable to TiTok-S with 128 latent tokens, while TiTok-L with
32 latent tokens matches the performance of TiTok-B with 64 latent tokens. This pattern indicates
that with each incremental increase in TiTok size (e.g., from S to B, or from B to L), it is possible to
reduce the size of the latent image representation without compromising performance. This trend
underscores the potential benefits of scaling up the tokenizer to achieve even more compact image
representations."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS,0.33080808080808083,"Semantics Emerges with Compact Latent Space. To evaluate the learned image representation, we
perform linear probing experiments on the image tokenizer, as shown in Fig. 4b. Specifically, we
add a batch normalization layer [31] followed by a linear layer on top of the frozen features from
TiTok encoder, with all hyper-parameters strictly following the MAE protocol [24]. We find that as
the size of the latent representation decreases, the tokenizer increasingly learns semantically rich
representations, as indicated by the improved linear probing accuracy. This suggests that the model
learns high-level information in scenarios of constrained representation space."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS,0.3333333333333333,"Compact Latent Representation Improves Generative Training. In addition to reconstruction
capabilities, we assess TiTok’s effectiveness and efficiency in generative downstream tasks, as
illustrated in Fig. 4c and Fig. 4d. We note that variants of different tokenizer sizes yield comparable
outcomes when the number of latent tokens is sufficiently large (i.e., K ≥128). However, within
the domain of compact latent sizes (i.e., K ≤64), larger tokenizers notably enhance performance.
Furthermore, the adaptability of 1D tokenization in TiTok facilitates more efficient and effective
generative model training. For instance, model variants with K = 32, despite inferior reconstruction
quality, demonstrate significantly better generative performance, underscoring the advantages of
employing a more condensed and semantically rich latent space for generative model training.
Additionally, the reduction in latent tokens markedly accelerates training and inference, with a 12.8×
increase in training speed (2815.2 vs. 219.7 samples/s/gpu) and a 4.5× speed up sampling speed
(123.1 vs. 27.5 samples/s/gpu), when utilizing K = 32 as opposed to K = 256."

to a more compact latent size. In this section, we majorly focus on ImageNet generation benchmarks
against prior arts, and evaluate TiTok as a tokenizer in the generative MaskGIT framework [9]."
MAIN EXPERIMENTS,0.3560606060606061,"Implementation Details. We primarily investigate the following TiTok variants: TiTok-S-128 (i.e.,
small model with 128 tokens), TiTok-B-64 (i.e., base model with 64 tokens), and TiTok-L-32 (i.e.,
large model with 32 tokens), where each variant designed to halve the latent space size while scaling
up the model size. For resolution 512, we double the latent size to ensure more details are kept at
higher resolution, leading to TiTok-L-64 and TiTok-B-128. In the final setting for TiTok training,
the codebook is configured to N = 4096, and the training duration is extended to 1M iterations
(200 epochs). We also adopt the “decoder fine-tuning” stage to further enhance model performance,
where the encoder and quantizer are kept frozen and the decoder is fine-tuned for 500k iterations.
For the training of generative models, we utilize the MaskGIT [9] framework without any specific
modifications, except for the adoption of an arccos masking schedule [6]. All other parameters are
the same as previous setups, and all design improvements will be verified in the ablation studies."

from MaskGIT [9] (rFID 2.28), while using 8× smaller latent representation size. Furthermore,
when using the same generator framework and same sampling steps, TiTok-L-32 improves over
MaskGIT by a large margin (from 6.18 to 2.77 gFID), showcasing the benefits of a more effective
generator training with compact 1D tokens. When compared to other diffusion-based generative

we ablate the tokenizer designs on image reconstruction. We begin with our baseline TiTok-L-32

increasing the training iterations (from 100 epochs to 200 epochs) yields another 0.37 improvement
of rFID. On top of that, the “decoder fine-tuning” (our stage-2 training strategy) can substantially
improve the overall reconstruction performance to 2.21 rFID."
ABLATION STUDIES,0.4065656565656566,"In Tab. 3b, we examine the effects of different masking schedules for MaskGIT with TiTok. Inter-
estingly, unlike the original MaskGIT setting [9] which empirically found that the cosine masking
schedule significantly outperforms the other schedules, we observe that MaskGIT equipped with
TiTok changes the preference to the arccos or linear schedules. Additionally, unlike [9] which
reported that the root schedule performs much worse than the others, we observe that TiTok is quite
robust to different masking schedules. We attribute the observations to TiTok’s ability to provide a
more compact and more semantic meaningful tokens compared to 2D VQGAN, as compared to the
cosine masking schedule, linear and arccos schedules have a lower masking ratio in the early steps.
This coincides with the observation that masking ratio is usually higher for redundant signals (e.g.,
75% masking ratio in images [24]) while relatively lower for semantic meaningful inputs (e.g., 15%
masking ratio in languages [15])."
ABLATION STUDIES,0.4090909090909091,"We ablate the effects of training paradigm in Tab. 3c. We begin with the training setting of

by building a 2D variant of TiTok-B64, where the architecture remains the same except that image
patches instead of latent tokens are used as image representation. As a result, we observe that the 2D
variant suffers from a much worse performance (15.58 vs. 5.15 rFID), since the fixed correspondences
in 2D tokenization limited a reasonable reconstruction under compact latent space. This result"
ABLATION STUDIES,0.4116161616161616,"demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed 1D tokenization, especially at a much more compact
latent size. Although TiTok can achieve a reasonably well performance under straightforward
single-stage training, there exists a performance gap compared to the MaskGIT-VQGAN [9]
due to the missing of a strong training recipe, of which no public reference or access exists.
Therefore, we adopt the two-stage training with proxy codes, which proves to be effective and can
outperform the MaskGIT-VQGAN (1.70 vs. 2.28 rFID). It is noteworthy that the two-stage training
is not that crucial to obtain a reasonable 1D tokenizer, and we believe that TiTok, with the simple
single-stage Taming-VQGAN’s training setting, could also benefit from training on a lagrer-scale
dataset [36] as demonstrated in [58] and we leave it for future work due to the limited compute."
ABLATION STUDIES,0.41414141414141414,"Details on the Two-Stage Training. We provide more technical details on the two-stage training.
Specifically:"
ABLATION STUDIES,0.4166666666666667,"• In the first stage (warm-up stage), we use an off-the-shelf ImageNet-pretrained MaskGIT-VQ
tokenizer to tokenize the input image into 256 tokens, which we refer to as proxy codes.
• In the first stage training, instead of regressing the original RGB values, we use the proxy
codes as reconstruction targets. Specifically, the workflow is: RGB images are patchified
and flattened into a sequence and concatenated with 32 latent tokens, then they are fed into
TiTok-Enc (Encoder of TiTok). Later, the latent tokens are kept as token representation
and go through the quantizer. The quantized latent tokens are concatenated with 256 mask
tokens and go through the TiTok-Dec (Decoder of TiTok). And the final output mask tokens
are supervised by proxy codes using cross-entropy loss.
• Afterwards, we freeze both the TiTok-Enc and quantizer, and then only fine-tune the
TiTok-Dec (responsible for reconstructing proxy codes) and MaskGIT-Dec (responsible
for reconstructing RGB values from proxy codes) end-to-end towards pixel space, where
the training losses include L2 loss, perceptual loss, and GAN loss following the common
VQGAN paradigm."
ABLATION STUDIES,0.41919191919191917,"Moreover, we also note that two-stage training is not necessary for TiTok training, and it works fine
with the commonly used and publicly available Taming-VQGAN recipe as is shown in Tab. 3c . In
this case, the whole workflow is pretty straightforward, where the TiTok-Dec will instead directly
reconstruct the images at pixel space."
ABLATION STUDIES,0.4217171717171717,"However, the Taming-VQGAN recipe (developed more than 3 years ago) leads to an inferior FID
score when compared to state-of-the-art tokenizers, putting TiTok at disadvantage when compared
against other methods. Therefore we propose the two-stage training to benefit TiTok from the state-
of-art MaskGIT-VQGAN tokenizer, which shares a similar architecture to Taming-VQGAN but has a

recent modern VQGAN recipe from [47, 68] in our preliminary experiments."

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.4292929292929293,"In this paper, we have explored a compact 1D tokenization TiTok for reconstructing and generating
natural images. Unlike the existing 2D VQ models that consider the image latent space as a 2D
grid, we provide a more compact formulation to tokenize an image into a 1D latent sequence. The
proposed TiTok can represent an image with 8 to 64 times fewer tokens than the commonly used 2D
tokenizers. Moreover, the compact 1D tokens not only significantly improve the generation model’s
training and inference throughput, but also achieve a competitive FID on the ImageNet benchmarks.
We hope our research can shed some light in the direction towards more efficient image representation
and generation models with 1D image tokenization."

Training and Testing Protocols"
REFERENCES,0.6641414141414141,"For image reconstruction (tokenizer) at preliminary experiments, the training augmentation is
confined to random cropping and flipping, following [19]. The training regimen spans a short
schedule, featuring a batch size of 256 over 500k training iterations, which correlates to roughly 100
epochs on the ImageNet dataset. We employ the AdamW optimizer [46] with an initial learning rate
of 1 × 10−4 (with cosine decay) and weight decay 1 × 10−4. We only adopt stage-1 training here
(i.e., only the “warm-up” training stage). For the main experiments, we adopt the improvements
as shown in the ablation study (Tab. 3 in main paper), including longer training to 200 epochs and
decoder fine-tuning, all other hyper-parameters remain the same. We use patch size 16 for all vision
transformers at resolution 256 × 256 and increase it to 32 for resolution 512 × 512 to ensure a
computation efficiency."

REFERENCES,0.6691919191919192,"For image generation (generator) at preliminary experiments, we majorly build the training and
testing protocols on top of [9]. Specifically, all images are pre-tokenized using center crop and
random flipping augmentation, and then processed by MaskGIT [9] to generate images via the
masked image modeling procedure. During inference, a cosine masking schedule is utilized with 8
steps. The generative models are trained with a batch size of 2048 and 500k iterations to improve
training efficiency. We use AdamW optimizer [46] with learning rate 2 × 10−4 and weight decay
0.03. The learning rate starts from 2 × 10−4 and then decay to 1 × 10−5 following a cosine decaying
schedule. We apply a dropout probability of 0.1 on the class condition. The only differences of
main experiments are using an arccos masking schedule as discussed in the ablation study (main
paper Tab. 3), all other hyper-parameters remain the same. We follow prior arts [19, 9] to generate
50k samples for generation FID evaluation. We also adopt classifier-free guidance [28] following
prior arts [10, 72]."

much faster pace. Specifically, TiTok-L-32 achieves 3.15 gFID, surpassing current state-of-the-art
MAGVIT-v2 [72]’s gFID 3.65, while requiring much fewer sampling steps (8 vs. 64) and smaller
model size (177M vs. 307M), leading to a substantial sampling speed-up (92.4× faster, 101.6 vs.
1.1 samples/sec). Additionally, when compared to MaskGIT [9], which uses the exact same generator
model (i.e., MaskGIT-ViT) as ours and the only difference is the toeknizer, TiTok-L-32 achieves
significantly a better performance (3.15 vs. 6.18). The improvement demonstrates the efficiency and
effectiveness of the learned compact 1D latent space for image representation. When it comes to
resolution 512 × 512 in Tab. 6, MaskGIT [9] requires 1024 tokens for image latent representation,
while TiTok-L-64 requires 16× fewer. As a result, when using the same generator (i.e., MaskGIT-

LIMITATIONS,0.8383838383838383,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations."

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Comprehensive details regarding model training and testing have been provided

and Supplementary Material Sec. A Training and Testing Protocols
Guidelines:"
THEORY ASSUMPTIONS AND PROOFS,0.8535353535353535,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

EXPERIMENT STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE,0.8964646464646465,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper."
EXPERIMENT STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE,0.898989898989899,"• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources"

societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The broader impacts have been discussed in Supplementary Material Sec. F
Broader Impacts.
Guidelines:"
EXPERIMENT STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE,0.9141414141414141,• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
EXPERIMENT STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE,0.9166666666666666,"• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."

SAFEGUARDS,0.9242424242424242,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.9267676767676768,"Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Although our study includes image generation,
we focus on class-conditional image generation with a predefined set of classes, which does
not pose the same risks as those text-to-image models."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9292929292929293,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9318181818181818,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
