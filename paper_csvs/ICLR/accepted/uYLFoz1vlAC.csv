ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0018281535648994515,"A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that
can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on
long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs,
and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they
still struggle to scale to very long sequences of 10000 or more steps. A promising
recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state
space model (SSM) x′(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t), and showed
that for appropriate choices of the state matrix A, this system could handle long-
range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has
prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a
general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space (S4)
sequence model based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it
can be computed much more efﬁciently than prior approaches while preserving
their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning A with a low-rank
correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the
well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results
across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91% accuracy
on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par
with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on
image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation 60× faster (iii)
SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the
challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as
efﬁcient as all competitors.1"

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.005484460694698354,"A central problem in sequence modeling is efﬁciently handling data that contains long-range depen-
dencies (LRDs). Real-world time-series data often requires reasoning over tens of thousands of time
steps, while few sequence models address even thousands of time steps. For instance, results from the
long-range arena (LRA) benchmark (Tay et al., 2021) highlight that sequence models today perform
poorly on LRD tasks, including one (Path-X) where no model performs better than random guessing."
INTRODUCTION,0.007312614259597806,"Since LRDs are perhaps the foremost challenge for sequence models, all standard model families
such as continuous-time models (CTMs), RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers include many specialized
variants designed to address them. Modern examples include orthogonal and Lipschitz RNNs
(Arjovsky et al., 2016; Erichson et al., 2021) to combat vanishing gradients, dilated convolutions to
increase context size (Bai et al., 2018; Oord et al., 2016), and an increasingly vast family of efﬁcient
Transformers that reduce the quadratic dependence on sequence length (Katharopoulos et al., 2020;
Choromanski et al., 2020). Despite being designed for LRDs, these solutions still perform poorly on
challenging benchmarks such as LRA (Tay et al., 2021) or raw audio classiﬁcation (Gu et al., 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.009140767824497258,"An alternative approach to LRDs was recently introduced based on the state space model (SSM)
(Fig. 1). SSMs are a foundational scientiﬁc model used in ﬁelds such as control theory, computational
neuroscience, and many more, but have not been applicable to deep learning for concrete theoretical
reasons. In particular, Gu et al. (2021) showed that deep SSMs actually struggle even on simple tasks,
but can perform exceptionally well when equipped with special state matrices A recently derived"

output y(t) through a latent state x(t). (Center) Recent theory on continuous-time memorization derives special
A matrices that allow SSMs to capture LRDs mathematically and empirically. (Right) SSMs can be computed
either as a recurrence (left) or convolution (right). However, materializing these conceptual views requires
utilizing different representations of its parameters (red, blue, green) which are very expensive to compute. S4
introduces a novel parameterization that efﬁciently swaps between these representations, allowing it to handle a
wide range of tasks, be efﬁcient at both training and inference, and excel at long sequences."
INTRODUCTION,0.025594149908592323,"to solve a problem of continuous-time memorization (Voelker et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2020a). Their
Linear State Space Layer (LSSL) conceptually uniﬁes the strengths of CTM, RNN and CNN models,
and provides a proof of concept that deep SSMs can address LRDs in principle."
INTRODUCTION,0.027422303473491772,"Unfortunately, the LSSL is infeasible to use in practice because of prohibitive computation and
memory requirements induced by the state representation. For state dimension N and sequence
length L, computing the latent state requires O(N 2L) operations and O(NL) space – compared to
a Ω(L + N) lower bound for both. Thus for reasonably sized models (e.g. N = 256 in Gu et al.
(2021)), the LSSL uses orders of magnitude more memory than comparably-sized RNNs or CNNs.
Although theoretically efﬁcient algorithms for the LSSL were proposed, we show that these are
numerically unstable. In particular, the special A matrix is highly non-normal in the linear algebraic
sense, which prevents the application of conventional algorithmic techniques. Consequently, although
the LSSL showed that SSMs have strong performance, they are currently computationally impractical
as a general sequence modeling solution."
INTRODUCTION,0.029250457038391225,"In this work, we introduce the Structured State Space (S4) sequence model based on the SSM that
solves the critical computational bottleneck in previous work. Technically, S4 reparameterizes the
structured state matrices A appearing in Voelker et al. (2019); Gu et al. (2020a) by decomposing
them as the sum of a low-rank and skew-symmetric term. Additionally, instead of expanding the
standard SSM in coefﬁcient space, we compute its truncated generating function in frequency space,
which can be simpliﬁed into a multipole-like evaluation. Combining these two ideas, we show that
the low-rank term can be corrected by the Woodbury identity while the skew-symmetric term can
be diagonalized stably, ultimately reducing to a well-studied and theoretically stable Cauchy kernel
(Pan, 2001; 2017). This results in ˜O(N + L) computation and O(N + L) memory usage, which is
essentially tight for sequence models. Compared to the LSSL, S4 is up to 30× faster with 400× less
memory usage, while exceeding the LSSL’s performance empirically."
INTRODUCTION,0.031078610603290677,"Empirically, S4 signiﬁcantly advances the state-of-the-art for LRD. On the LRA benchmark for
efﬁcient sequence models, S4 is as fast as all baselines while outperforming them by 20+ points on
average. S4 is the ﬁrst model to solve the difﬁcult LRA Path-X task (length-16384), achieving 88%
accuracy compared to 50% random guessing for all prior work. On speech classiﬁcation with
length-16000 sequences, S4 halves the test error (1.7%) of specialized Speech CNNs – by contrast,
all RNN and Transformer baselines fail to learn (≥70% error)."
INTRODUCTION,0.03290676416819013,"Towards a general-purpose sequence model.
Beyond LRD, a broad goal of machine learning
is to develop a single model that can be used across a wide range of problems. Models today are
typically specialized to solve problems from a particular domain (e.g. images, audio, text, time-series),
and enable a narrow range of capabilities (e.g. efﬁcient training, fast generation, handling irregularly
sampled data). This specialization is typically expressed via domain-speciﬁc preprocessing, inductive
biases, and architectures. Sequence models provide a general framework for solving many of these
problems with reduced specialization – e.g. Vision Transformers for image classiﬁcation with less"

ADDRESSING LONG-RANGE DEPENDENCIES WITH HIPPO,0.0603290676416819,"Prior work found that the basic SSM (1) actually performs very poorly in practice. Intuitively, one
explanation is that linear ﬁrst-order ODEs solve to an exponential function, and thus may suffer
from gradients scaling exponentially in the sequence length (i.e., the vanishing/exploding gradients
problem (Pascanu et al., 2013)). To address this problem, the LSSL leveraged the HiPPO theory
of continuous-time memorization (Gu et al., 2020a). HiPPO speciﬁes a class of certain matrices
A ∈RN×N that when incorporated into (1), allows the state x(t) to memorize the history of the
input u(t). The most important matrix in this class is deﬁned by equation (2), which we will call the
HiPPO matrix. For example, the LSSL found that simply modifying an SSM from a random matrix
A to equation (2) improved its performance on the sequential MNIST benchmark from 60% to 98%."

Theorem 2 (S4 Recurrence). Given any step size ∆, computing one step of the recurrence (3) can
be done in O(N) operations where N is the state size."

Woodbury identity). This implies that the discretized matrix A is the product of two DPLR matrices
and thus has O(N) matrix-vector multiplication. Appendix C.2 computes A in closed DPLR form.
Theorem 3 (S4 Convolution). Given any step size ∆, computing the SSM convolution ﬁlter K can
be reduced to 4 Cauchy multiplies, requiring only eO(N + L) operations and O(N + L) space."

maps of size H instead of 1. S4 handles multiple features by simply deﬁning H independent copies of
itself, and then mixing the H features with a position-wise linear layer for a total of O(H2)+O(HN)
parameters per layer. Nonlinear activation functions are also inserted between these layers. Overall,
S4 deﬁnes a sequence-to-sequence map of shape (batch size, sequence length, hidden dimension),

problems: (i) the Long-Range Arena, a well-known benchmark designed to test efﬁcient sequence
models on LRDs, and (ii) a speech classiﬁcation problem as a real-world test of LRDs."

SSMs are a promising candidate that come with a range of capabilities, and S4’s strong results on LRD

model. In this section, we focus on understanding this question in more depth by highlighting key
strengths of S4 in settings that usually require specialized models. The tasks we focus on (generative

DISCUSSION"
REFERENCES,0.3802559414990859,"Related Work.
Our work is most closely related to a line of work originally motivated by a
particular biologically-inspired SSM, which led to mathematical models for addressing LRDs.
Voelker (2019); Voelker et al. (2019) derived a non-trainable SSM motivated from approximating
a neuromorphic spiking model, and Chilkuri & Eliasmith (2021) showed that it could be sped up
at train time with a convolutional view. Gu et al. (2020a) extended this special case to a general
continuous-time function approximation framework with several more special cases of A matrices
designed for long-range dependencies. However, instead of using a true SSM, all of these works ﬁxed
a choice of A and built RNNs around it. Most recently, Gu et al. (2021) used the full (1) explicitly as
a deep SSM model, exploring new conceptual views of SSMs, as well as allowing A to be trained.
As mentioned in Section 1, their method used a naive instantiation of SSMs that suffered from an
additional factor of N in memory and N 2 in computation."
REFERENCES,0.3820840950639854,"Beyond this work, our technical contributions (Section 3) on the S4 parameterization and algorithms
are applicable to a broader family of SSMs including these investigated in prior works, and our
techniques for working with these models may be of independent interest."
REFERENCES,0.38391224862888484,"Implementation.
The computational core of S4’s training algorithm is the Cauchy kernel discussed
in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 and Appendix C.3. As described in Appendix C.3 Proposition 5, there are
many algorithms for it with differing computational complexities and sophistication. Our current
implementation of S4 actually uses the naive O(NL) algorithm which is easily parallelized on GPUs
and has more easily accessible libraries allowing it to be implemented; we leverage the pykeops
library for memory-efﬁcient kernel operations. However, this library is a much more general library
that may not be optimized for the Cauchy kernels used here, and we believe that a dedicated CUDA
implementation can be more efﬁcient. Additionally, as discussed in this work, there are asymptotically
faster and numerically stable algorithms for the Cauchy kernel (Proposition 5). However, these
algorithms are currently not implemented for GPUs due to a lack of previous applications that require
them. We believe that more efﬁcient implementations of these self-contained computational kernels"

efﬁciency."
REFERENCES,0.38939670932358317,"Limitations and Future Directions.
In this work, we show that S4 can address a wide variety of
data effectively. However, it may not necessarily be the most suitable model for all types of data. For
example, Table 7 still found a gap compared to Transformers for language modeling. An interesting
future direction is exploring combinations of S4 with other sequence models to complement their
strengths. We are excited about other directions, including continuing to explore the beneﬁts of
S4 on audio data (e.g. pre-training or generation settings), and generalizing HiPPO and S4 to
higher-dimensional data for image and video applications."
