ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0035842293906810036,"For robots operating in the real world, it is desirable to learn reusable behaviours
that can effectively be transferred and adapted to numerous tasks and scenarios.
We propose an approach to learn abstract motor skills from data using a hierar-
chical mixture latent variable model. In contrast to existing work, our method
exploits a three-level hierarchy of both discrete and continuous latent variables,
to capture a set of high-level behaviours while allowing for variance in how they
are executed. We demonstrate in manipulation domains that the method can effec-
tively cluster ofﬂine data into distinct, executable behaviours, while retaining the
ﬂexibility of a continuous latent variable model. The resulting skills can be trans-
ferred and ﬁne-tuned on new tasks, unseen objects, and from state to vision-based
policies, yielding better sample efﬁciency and asymptotic performance compared
to existing skill- and imitation-based methods. We further analyse how and when
the skills are most beneﬁcial: they encourage directed exploration to cover large
regions of the state space relevant to the task, making them most effective in chal-
lenging sparse-reward settings."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.010752688172043012,"Reinforcement learning is a powerful and ﬂexible paradigm to train embodied agents, but relies on
large amounts of agent experience, computation, and time, on each individual task. Learning each
task from scratch is inefﬁcient: it is desirable to learn a set of skills that can efﬁciently be reused and
adapted to related downstream tasks. This is particularly pertinent for real-world robots, where inter-
action is expensive and data-efﬁciency is crucial. There are numerous existing approaches to learn
transferable embodied skills, usually formulated as a two-level hierarchy with a high-level controller
and low-level skills. These methods predominantly represent skills as being either continuous, such
as goal-conditioned (Lynch et al., 2019; Pertsch et al., 2020b) or latent space policies (Haarnoja
et al., 2018; Merel et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2021); or discrete, such as mixture or option-based
methods (Sutton et al., 1999; Daniel et al., 2012; Florensa et al., 2017; Wulfmeier et al., 2021). Our
goal is to combine these perspectives to leverage their complementary advantages."
INTRODUCTION,0.014336917562724014,"We propose an approach to learn a three-level skill hierarchy from an ofﬂine dataset, capturing both
discrete and continuous variations at multiple levels of behavioural abstraction. The model com-
prises a low-level latent-conditioned controller that can learn motor primitives, a set of continuous
latent mid-level skills, and a discrete high-level controller that can compose and select among these
abstract mid-level behaviours. Since the mid- and high-level form a mixture, we call our method
Hierarchical Latent Mixtures of Skills (HeLMS). We demonstrate on challenging object manipula-
tion tasks that our method can decompose a dataset into distinct, intuitive, and reusable behaviours.
We show that these skills lead to improved sample efﬁciency and performance in numerous trans-
fer scenarios: reusing skills for new tasks, generalising across unseen objects, and transferring from
state to vision-based policies. Further analysis and ablations reveal that both continuous and discrete
components are beneﬁcial, and that the learned hierarchical skills are most useful in sparse-reward
settings, as they encourage directed exploration of task-relevant parts of the state space."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.035842293906810034,"A long-standing challenge in reinforcement learning is the ability to learn reusable motor skills that
can be transferred efﬁciently to related settings. One way to learn such skills is via multi-task rein-
forcement learning (Heess et al., 2016; James et al., 2018; Hausman et al., 2018; Riedmiller et al.,
2018), with the intuition that behaviors useful for a given task should aid the learning of related tasks.
However, this often requires careful curation of the task set, where each skill represents a separate
task. Some approaches avoid this by learning skills in an unsupervised manner using intrinsic objec-
tives that often maximize the entropy of visited states while keeping skills distinguishable (Gregor
et al., 2017; Eysenbach et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020)."
RELATED WORK,0.03942652329749104,"A large body of work explores skills from the perspective of unsupervised segmentation of repeat-
able behaviours in temporal data (Niekum & Barto, 2011; Ranchod et al., 2015; Kr¨uger et al., 2016;
Lioutikov et al., 2017; Shiarlis et al., 2018; Kipf et al., 2019; Tanneberg et al., 2021). Other works
investigate movement or motor primitives that can be selected or sequenced together to solve com-
plex manipulation or locomotion tasks (M¨ulling et al., 2013; Rueckert et al., 2015; Lioutikov et al.,
2015; Paraschos et al., 2018; Merel et al., 2020; Tosatto et al., 2021; Dalal et al., 2021). Some
of these methods also employ mixture models to jointly model low-level motion primitives and a
high-level primitive controller (Muelling et al., 2010; Colom´e & Torras, 2018; Pervez & Lee, 2018);
the high-level controller can also be implicit and decentralised over the low-level primitives (Goyal
et al., 2019)."
RELATED WORK,0.043010752688172046,"Several existing approaches employ architectures in which the policy is comprised of two (or more)
levels of hierarchy.
Typically, a low-level controller represents the learned set of skills, and a
high-level policy instructs the low-level controller via a latent variable or goal. Such latent vari-
ables can be discrete (Florensa et al., 2017; Wulfmeier et al., 2020) or continuous (Nachum et al.,
2018; Haarnoja et al., 2018) and regularization of the latent space is often crucial (Tirumala et al.,
2019). The latent variable can represent the behaviour for one timestep, for a ﬁxed number of
timesteps (Ajay et al., 2021), or options with different durations (Sutton et al., 1999; Bacon et al.,
2017; Wulfmeier et al., 2021). One such approach that is particularly relevant (Florensa et al., 2017)
learns a diverse set of skills, via a discrete latent variable that interacts multiplicatively with the state
to enable continuous variation in a Stochastic Neural Network policy; this skill space is then trans-
ferred to locomotion tasks by learning a new categorical controller. Our method differs in a few key
aspects: our proposed three-level hierarchical architecture explicitly models abstract discrete skills
while allowing for temporal dependence and lower-level latent variation in their execution, enabling
diverse object-centric behaviours in challenging manipulation tasks."
RELATED WORK,0.04659498207885305,"Our work is related to methods that learn robot policies from demonstrations (LfD, e.g. (Rajeswaran
et al., 2018; Shiarlis et al., 2018; Strudel et al., 2020)) or more broadly from logged data (ofﬂine
RL, e.g. (Wu et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020)). While many of these focus on
learning single-task policies, several approaches learn skills ofﬂine that can be transferred online
to new tasks (Merel et al., 2019; Lynch et al., 2019; Pertsch et al., 2020a; Ajay et al., 2021; Singh
et al., 2021). These all train a two-level hierarchical model, with a high-level encoder that maps to
a continuous latent space, and a low-level latent-conditioned controller. The high-level encoder can
encode a whole trajectory (Pertsch et al., 2020a; 2021; Ajay et al., 2021); a short look-ahead state
sequence (Merel et al., 2019); the current and ﬁnal goal state (Lynch et al., 2019); or can even be
simple isotropic Gaussian noise (Singh et al., 2021) that can be ﬂexibly transformed by a ﬂow-based
low-level controller. At transfer time, a new high-level policy is learned from scratch: this can be
more efﬁcient with skill priors (Pertsch et al., 2020a) or temporal abstraction (Ajay et al., 2021)."

of behaviour via the high-level controller, and learns an additional mid-level which is able to transfer
abstract skills to downstream tasks, rather than learning a continuous latent policy from scratch."

METHOD"
METHOD,0.06810035842293907,"This paper examines a two-stage problem setup: an ofﬂine stage where a hierarchical skill space
is learned from a dataset, and an online stage where these skills are transferred to a reinforcement
learning setting. The dataset D comprises a set of trajectories, each a sequence of state-action pairs
{xt, at}T
t=0. The model incorporates a discrete latent variable yt ∈{1, . . . , K} as a high-level skill
selector (for a ﬁxed number of skills K), and a mid-level continuous variable zt ∈Rnz conditioned
on yt which parameterises each skill. Marginally, zt is then a latent mixture distribution represent-
ing both a discrete set of skills and the variation in their execution. A sample of zt represents an
abstract behaviour, which is then executed by a low-level controller p(at | zt, xt). The learned skill
space can then be transferred to a reinforcement learning agent π in a Markov Decision Process de-
ﬁned by tuple {S, A, T , R, γ}: these represent the state, action, and transition distributions, reward
function, and discount factor respectively. When transferring, we train a new high-level controller
that acts either at the level of discrete skills yt or continuous zt, and freeze lower levels of the policy."

LATENT MIXTURE SKILL SPACES FROM OFFLINE DATA,0.14695340501792115,"Information-asymmetry
As noted in previous work (Tirumala et al., 2019; Galashov et al., 2019),
hierarchical approaches often beneﬁt from information-asymmetry, with higher levels seeing addi-
tional context or task-speciﬁc information. This ensures that the high-level remains responsible for
abstract, task-related behaviours, while the low-level executes simpler motor primitives. We employ
similar techniques in HeLMS: the low-level inputs xLL comprise the proprioceptive state of the em-
bodied agent; the mid-level inputs xML also include the poses of objects in the environment; and the
high-level xHL concatenates both object and proprioceptive state for a short number of lookahead
timesteps. The high- and low-level are similar to (Merel et al., 2019), with the low-level controller
enabling motor primitives based on proprioceptive information, and the high-level using the looka-
head information to provide additional context regarding behavioural intent when specifying which
skill to use. The key difference is the categorical high-level and the additional mid-level, with which
HeLMS can learn more object-centric skills and transfer these to downstream tasks."
LATENT MIXTURE SKILL SPACES FROM OFFLINE DATA,0.15053763440860216,"Network architectures
The architecture and information ﬂow in HeLMS are shown in Figure 1b.
The high-level network contains a gated head, which uses the previous skill yt−1 to index into one of
K categorical heads, each of which specify a distribution over yt. For a given yt, the corresponding
mid-level skill network is selected and used to sample a latent action zt, which is then used as input
for the latent-conditioned low-level controller, which parameterises the action distribution. The skill
transition prior p(yt | yt−1) is also learned, and is parameterised as a linear softmax layer which
takes in a one-hot representation of yt−1 and outputs the distribution over yt. All components are
trained end-to-end via the objective in Equation 3."

uniform categorical prior to encourage diversity. While any RL algorithm could be used to optimize
π(yt | xt), in this paper we use MPO (Abdolmaleki et al., 2018) with a categorical action distribu-
tion (see Appendix B for details). We hypothesise that this method improves sample efﬁciency by
converting a continuous control problem into a discrete abstract action space, which may also aid in
credit assignment. However, since both the mid-level components and low-level are frozen, it can
limit ﬂexibility and plasticity, and also requires that all of the mid- and low-level input states are

components can also be initialised to q(zt | yt, xt), to allow for initial exploration over the space
of skills. Alternatively, the mixture components can use different inputs, such as vision: this setup
allows vision-based skills to be learned efﬁciently by regularising to state-based skills learned of-
ﬂine. We optimise this using RHPO (Wulfmeier et al., 2020), which employs a similar underlying

in our experiments. For more details and an ablation, see Appendix A.2.
• Behaviour Cloning (BC): We apply behaviour cloning to the dataset, and ﬁne-tune this
policy via MPO on the downstream task. While the actor is initialised to the solution
obtained via BC, the critic still needs to be learned from scratch.
• Hierarchical BC: We evaluate a hierarchical variant of BC with a similar latent space z
to NPMP using a latent Gaussian high-level controller. However, rather than freezing the
low-level and learning just a high-level policy, Hierarchical BC ﬁne-tunes the entire model.
• Asymmetric actor-critic: For state-to-vision transfer, HeLMS uses prior skills that depend
on object states to learn a purely vision-based policy. Thus, we also compare against a
variant of MPO with an asymmetric actor-critic (Pinto et al., 2017) setup, which uses object
states differently: to speed up learning of the critic, while still learning a vision-based actor."

the gripper moves to the red object, or a grasping skill (row 3) where the gripper lowers and closes its

We next evaluate whether the previously learned skills (i.e.
trained on the simple objects in set 4) can effectively transfer to more challenging object interaction
scenarios: the other four object sets proposed by (Lee et al., 2021). The task uses a sparse staged
reward, with reward incrementally given after completing each sub-goal of the stacking task. As
shown in Figure 4, both variants of HeLMS learn signiﬁcantly faster than baselines on the different
object sets. Compared to the strongest baseline (NPMP), HeLMS reaches better average asymptotic
performance (and much lower variance) on two object sets (1 and 3), performs similarly on set 5,
and does poorer on object set 2. The performance on object set 2 potentially highlights a trade-off
between incorporating higher-level abstract behaviours and maintaining low-level ﬂexibility: this
object set often requires a reorientation of the bottom object due to its slanted faces, a behaviour that
is not common in the ofﬂine dataset, which might require greater adaptation of mid- and low-level
skills. This is an interesting investigation we leave for future work."

stack the blue object on top to construct a pyramid. The task is speciﬁed via a sparse staged reward"

While our method learns skills from proprioception and ob-

This is invaluable for practical real-world scenarios, since the agent acts from pure visual observa-
tion at test time without requiring privileged and often difﬁcult-to-obtain object state information."
TRANSFER TO DOWNSTREAM TASKS,0.3118279569892473,"We use the HeLMS-mix variant to transfer skills to a vision-based policy, by reusing the low-level

prioception as input), and KL-regularising these to the previously learned state-based skills. While
the learned policy is vision-based, this KL-regularisation still assumes access to object states during
training. For a fair comparison, we additionally compare our approach with a version of MPO using
an asymmetric critic (Pinto et al., 2017), which exploits object state information instead of vision in
the critic, and also use this for HeLMS. As shown in Figure 6, learning a vision-based policy with
MPO from scratch is very slow and computationally intensive, but an asymmetric critic signiﬁcantly
speeds up learning, supporting the empirical ﬁndings of Pinto et al. (2017). However, HeLMS once
again demonstrates better sample efﬁciency, and reaches slightly better asymptotic performance. We
note that this uses the same ofﬂine model as for the object generalisation experiments, showing that
the same state-based skill space can be reused in numerous settings, even for vision-based tasks."

WHERE AND HOW CAN HIERARCHICAL SKILL REUSE BE EFFECTIVE?"
TRANSFER TO DOWNSTREAM TASKS,0.31899641577060933,"Sparse reward tasks
We ﬁrst investigate how HeLMS performs for different rewards: a dense
shaped reward, the sparse staged reward from the object generalisation experiments, and a fully
sparse reward that is only provided after the agent stacks the object. For this experiment, we use the
skill space trained on red_on_blue_stacking and transfer it to the same RL task of stacking
on object set 4. The results are shown in Figure 7. With a dense reward (and no object transfer
required), all of the approaches can successfully learn the task. With the sparse staged reward, the
baselines all plateau at a lower performance, with the exception of NPMP, as previously discussed.
However, for the challenging fully-sparse scenario, HeLMS is the only method that achieves non-
zero reward. This neatly illustrates the beneﬁt of the proposed hierarchy of skills: it allows for
directed exploration which ensures that even sparse rewards can be encountered. This is consistent
with observations from prior work in hierarchical reinforcement learning (Florensa et al., 2017;
Nachum et al., 2019), and we next investigate this claim in more depth for our manipulation setting."
TRANSFER TO DOWNSTREAM TASKS,0.3225806451612903,"Exploration

reward an order of magnitude greater. Further, in this experiment we found it was able to achieve
the fully sparse reward (stacked) in one episode. Analysing the state coverage results, while other
methods are able to cover the joint space more (e.g. by randomly moving the joints), HeLMS is
nearly two orders of magnitude higher for grasp states. This indicates the utility of hierarchical
skills: by acting over the space of abstract skills rather than low-level actions, HeLMS performs
directed exploration and targets particular states of interest, such as grasping an object."

‘discrete-only’) and transfer to the stacking task with sparse staged reward in an easy case (object set

only’ case with just a single Gaussian to represent the high- and mid-level skills: this is equivalent
to the NPMP+KL baseline. We observe the the discrete component alone leads to improved sam-
ple efﬁciency in both cases, but modelling both discrete and continuous latent behaviours makes a
signiﬁcant difference in the hard case. In other words, when adapting to challenging objects, it is
important to capture discrete skills, but allow for latent variation in how they are executed."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.36200716845878134,"We present HeLMS, an approach to learn transferable and reusable skills from ofﬂine data using a
hierarchical mixture latent variable model. We analyse the learned skills to show that they effectively
cluster data into distinct, interpretable behaviours. We demonstrate that the learned skills can be
ﬂexibly transferred to different tasks, unseen objects, and to different modalities (such as from state
to vision). Ablation studies indicate that it is beneﬁcial to model both discrete modes and continuous
variation in behaviour, and highlight the importance of KL-regularisation when transferring to RL
and ﬁne-tuning the entire mixture of skills. We also perform extensive analysis to understand where
and how the proposed skill hierarchy can be most useful: we ﬁnd that it is particularly invaluable in
sparse reward settings due to its ability to perform directed exploration."
CONCLUSION,0.3655913978494624,"There are a number of interesting avenues for future work. While our model demonstrated temporal
consistency, it would be useful to more actively encourage and exploit this for sample-efﬁcient
transfer. It would also be useful to extend this work to better ﬁne-tune lower level behaviours, to
allow for ﬂexibility while exploiting high-level behavioural abstractions."
CONCLUSION,0.36917562724014336,"1Note that HeLMS-cat and HeLMS-mix are identical for this analysis: at the start of reinforcement learning,

ABLATIONS FOR KL-REGULARISATION"
REFERENCES,0.5985663082437276,"In these experiments, we investigate the effect of KL-regularisation on the mid-level components,
both for the ofﬂine learning phase (regularising each component to p(zt | yt) = N(0, I) via coefﬁ-
cient βz), and the online reinforcement learning stage via HeLMS-mix (regularising each component
to the mid-level skills learned ofﬂine, via coefﬁcient ηz)). The results are reported in Figure 9, where
each plot represents a different setting for ofﬂine KL-regularisation (either regularisation to N(0, I)
with βz = 0.01, or no regularisation with βz = 0) and a different transfer case (the easy case of
transferring to object set 4, or the hard case of transferring to object set 3). Each plot shows the
downstream performance when varying the strength of KL-regularisation during RL via coefﬁcient
ηz. The HeLMS-cat approach represents the extreme case where the skills are entirely frozen (i.e.
full regularisation)."
REFERENCES,0.6021505376344086,"The results suggest some interesting properties of the latent skill space based on regularisation.
When regularising the mid-level components to the N(0, I) prior, it is important to regularise dur-
ing online RL; this is especially true for the hard transfer case, where HeLMS-cat performs much
better, and the performance degrades signiﬁcantly with lower regularisation values. However, when
removing mid-level regularisation during ofﬂine learning, the method is insensitive to regularisation
during RL over the entire range evaluated, from 0.01 to 100.0. We conjecture that with mid-level
skills regularised to N(0, I), the different mid-level skills are drawn closer together and occupy a
more compact region in latent space, such that KL-regularisation is necessary during RL for a skill
to avoid drifting and overlapping with the latent distribution of other skills (i.e. skill degeneracy). In
contrast, without ofﬂine KL-regularisation, the skills are free to expand and occupy more distant re-
gions of the latent space, rendering further regularisation unnecessary during RL. Such latent space
properties could be further analysed to improve learning and transfer of skills; we leave this as an
interesting direction for future work."
