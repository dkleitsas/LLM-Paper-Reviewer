ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.003745318352059925,"Automatic Music Transcription (AMT), inferring musical notes from raw audio, is
a challenging task at the core of music understanding. Unlike Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR), which typically focuses on the words of a single speaker,
AMT often requires transcribing multiple instruments simultaneously, all while
preserving ﬁne-scale pitch and timing information. Further, many AMT datasets
are “low-resource”, as even expert musicians ﬁnd music transcription difﬁcult and
time-consuming. Thus, prior work has focused on task-speciﬁc architectures, tai-
lored to the individual instruments of each task. In this work, motivated by the
promising results of sequence-to-sequence transfer learning for low-resource Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP), we demonstrate that a general-purpose Trans-
former model can perform multi-task AMT, jointly transcribing arbitrary com-
binations of musical instruments across several transcription datasets. We show
this uniﬁed training framework achieves high-quality transcription results across
a range of datasets, dramatically improving performance for low-resource instru-
ments (such as guitar), while preserving strong performance for abundant instru-
ments (such as piano). Finally, by expanding the scope of AMT, we expose the
need for more consistent evaluation metrics and better dataset alignment, and pro-
vide a strong baseline for this new direction of multi-task AMT.1"

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.011235955056179775,"Recorded music often contains multiple instruments playing together; these multiple “tracks” of a
song make music transcription challenging for both algorithms and human experts. A transcriber
must pick each note out of the audio mixture, estimate its pitch and timing, and identify the instru-
ment on which the note was performed. An AMT system should be capable of transcribing multiple
instruments at once (Multitrack) for a diverse range of styles and combinations of musical instru-
ments (Multi-Task). Despite the importance of Multi-Task Multitrack Music Transcription (MT3),
several barriers have prevented researchers from addressing it. First, no model has yet proven capa-
ble of transcribing arbitrary combinations of instruments across a variety of datasets. Second, even
if such models existed, no uniﬁed collection of AMT datasets has been gathered that spans a variety
of AMT tasks. Finally, even within current AMT datasets, evaluation is inconsistent, with different
research efforts using different metrics and test splits for each dataset."
INTRODUCTION,0.0149812734082397,"Compounding this challenge, many music datasets are relatively small in comparison to the datasets
used to train large-scale sequence models in other domains such as NLP or ASR. Existing open-
source music transcription datasets contain between one and a few hundred hours of audio (see Ta-
ble 1), while standard ASR datasets LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015) and CommonVoice (Ardila
et al., 2020) contain 1k and 9k+ hours of audio, respectively. LibriSpeech alone contains more hours
of audio than all of the AMT datasets we use in this paper, combined. Taken as a whole, AMT ﬁts
the general description of a “low-resource” task, where data is scarce."

MUSIC TRANSCRIPTION"
MUSIC TRANSCRIPTION,0.07865168539325842,"Historically, music transcription research has focused on transcribing recordings of solo piano (Po-
liner & Ellis, 2006; B¨ock & Schedl, 2012; Kelz et al., 2016). As a result, there are a large number
of transcription models whose success relies on hand-designed representations for piano transcrip-
tion. For instance, the Onsets & Frames model (Hawthorne et al., 2017) uses dedicated outputs for
detecting piano onsets and the note being played; Kelz et al. (2019) represents the entire ampli-
tude envelope of a piano note; and Kong et al. (2020) additionally models piano foot pedal events (a
piano-speciﬁc way of controlling a note’s sustain). Single-instrument transcription models have also
been developed for other instruments such as guitar (Xi et al., 2018) and drums (Cartwright & Bello,
2018; Callender et al., 2020), though these instruments have received less attention than piano."
MUSIC TRANSCRIPTION,0.08239700374531835,"Although not as widespread, some multi-instrument transcription systems have been developed. For
example, Manilow et al. (2020) presents the Cerberus model, which simultaneously performs source
separation and transcription for a ﬁxed and predeﬁned set of instruments. Lin et al. (2021) also
perform both separation and transcription, albeit based on an audio query input and with the addition
of synthesis. ReconVAT (Cheuk et al., 2021) uses an approach based on U-Net and unsupervised
learning techniques to perform transcription on low-resource datasets; however, the model does not
predict instrument labels, instead outputting a single pianoroll that combines all instruments into a
single “track”. A similar limitation applies to the early transcription system introduced alongside
the MusicNet dataset by Thickstun et al. (2016). Tanaka et al. (2020) uses a clustering approach to
separate transcribed instruments, but the model output does not include explicit instrument labels.
In contrast, our model outputs a stream of events representing notes from an arbitrary number of
instruments with each note explicitly assigned to an instrument; it learns to detect the presence (or
absence) of instruments directly from audio spectrograms (see Figure 1)."
MUSIC TRANSCRIPTION,0.08614232209737828,"The work most closely related to ours is Hawthorne et al. (2021), which uses an encoder-decoder
Transformer architecture to transcribe solo piano recordings. Here, we extend their approach to
transcribe polyphonic music with an arbitrary number of instruments. We adhere to their philos-
ophy of using components as close to “off-the-shelf” as possible: spectrogram inputs, a standard
Transformer conﬁguration from T5, and MIDI-like output events."

being played. A key contribution of this work is to frame multi-instrument transcription, where
different source instruments are present in a single input audio stream, within this paradigm and
allow the model to learn which instruments are present in the source audio using Transformer model
paired with a novel vocabulary designed to support this general task."

TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE,0.11610486891385768,"In the T5 architecture, a sequence of inputs is mapped to a sequence of learned embeddings plus ﬁxed
positional embeddings; we use absolute positional embeddings instead of the bucketed “relative”
embeddings used in Raffel et al. (2019) to ensure that all positions can be attended to with equal
resolution. The model uses a series of standard Transformer self-attention “blocks” in both the
encoder and decoder. In order to produce a sequence of output tokens, the model uses greedy
autoregressive decoding: an input sequence is fed in, the output token with the highest predicted
probability of occurring next is appended to the sequence, and the process is repeated until an end-
of-sequence (EOS) token is produced. We use the T5 “small” model, which contains approximately
60 million parameters. While much larger models are commonly used in language modeling tasks,
we found that increasing model size tended to exacerbate overﬁtting. Full details on the Transformer
architecture used in this work are given in Appendix A. Additionally, we make our code available
along with the release of this paper at https://github.com/magenta/mt3."

MODEL INPUTS AND OUTPUTS,0.12359550561797752,"As shown in Figure 1, MT3 uses log Mel spectrograms as inputs. For the outputs, we construct a
token vocabulary inspired by the MIDI speciﬁcation, which we refer to as “MIDI-like” because it
contains a subset of the original MIDI2 speciﬁcation (1996) (e.g. our vocabulary does not represent
“control change” MIDI events). This output is a modiﬁcation of the vocabulary of Hawthorne et al.
(2021) with the following differences: (1) addition of instrument change tokens, which allow for
multiple instruments to be represented in a single event stream; (2) removal of velocity, as most of
our training datasets do not contain velocity annotations (and there is no standardized method for
coding velocity across datasets); (3) “ties” to better handle notes that span multiple segments. The

ments, datasets, and orchestrations, without manual tuning of the model or vocabulary. In contrast,
prior works have been limited to models which transcribe only a single instrument (Hawthorne et al.,
2021), contain separate transcription “heads” for a ﬁxed set of instruments (Manilow et al., 2020),
or ignore the instrument dimension entirely and only transcribe the notes (Cheuk et al., 2021)."
MODEL INPUTS AND OUTPUTS,0.16853932584269662,"One limitation of sequence models applied to audio is that most audio sequences are too large to ﬁt
in memory when modeling using a Transformer architecture, which requires O(n2) memory with
respect to sequence length for the self-attention blocks. In order to address these constraints, we
use the procedure described by Hawthorne et al. (2021): audio is split into smaller, non-overlapping
segments, with input spectrograms and event tokens extracted from each segment. The model pro-
cesses each segment independently. The same procedure is used for both training and inference;
however, at inference time we take the additional step of concatenating the decoded events from all
segments into a single sequence to reconstruct the full example."
MODEL INPUTS AND OUTPUTS,0.17228464419475656,"One issue with transcribing cropped audio segments independently is that a note may span multiple
segments. While our basic approach is often able to handle such cases, we ﬁnd that occasionally
the model will forget to “turn off” a note. To ameliorate this problem, we introduce a “tie” section
at the beginning of each segment where the model must declare which notes are already active;
that is, the model is trained to emit Program and Pitch tokens for already-active notes, followed by
the End Tie Section token, followed by the events of the segment. When concatenating segments
to reconstruct an entire transcribed example, we end any notes not explicitly declared in the tie
section. This allows the model to fail gracefully when it detects a note-on in one segment but not
the corresponding note-off in a subsequent segment."

MULTI-TASK MIXTURE,0.1797752808988764,"In addition to removing the cumbersome task of constructing specialized architectures and loss
functions for different instrumentations and datasets, our general output vocabulary also allows our
model to be trained on a mixture of several datasets simultaneously, similar to how multilingual
translation models such as mT5 are trained on several languages (Xue et al., 2020). This approach
not only simpliﬁes model design and training, but also increases the amount and diversity of training
data available to the model. As noted previously, scarcity of training data has been a major challenge
for prior AMT modeling efforts. This mixture approach has not previously been demonstrated in the
music transcription literature; instead, prior works have often focused on training separate models
for individual datasets (i.e. Cheuk et al. (2021)). We note that “mixing” here refers to including data
from multiple datasets within a single training batch."

begins) in evaluating whether a prediction is correct."
EVALUATION,0.26591760299625467,"To provide the fairest and most complete comparison to existing work, we evaluate models on each
dataset using three standard measures of transcription performance: Frame F1, Onset F1, and Onset-
Offset F1. We use the standard implementation of these metrics from the mir eval Python toolkit.
For each metric, mir eval uses bipartite graph matching to ﬁnd the optimal pairing of reference
and estimated notes, then computes precision, recall, and F1 score using the following criteria:"
EVALUATION,0.2696629213483146,"Frame F1 score uses a binary measure of whether a pianoroll-like representation of the predictions
and targets match. Each second is divided into a ﬁxed number of “frames” (we use 62.5 frames per
second), and a sequence of notes is represented as a binary matrix of size [frames × 128] indicating
the presence or absence of an active note at a given pitch and time."
EVALUATION,0.27340823970037453,"Onset F1 score considers a prediction to be correct if it has the same pitch and is within ±50 ms of
a reference onset. This metric ignores note offsets."
EVALUATION,0.27715355805243447,"Onset-Offset F1 score is the strictest metric commonly used in the transcription literature. In ad-
dition to matching onsets and pitch as above, notes must also have matching offsets. The criterion
for matching offsets is that offsets must be within 0.2 · reference duration or 50 ms from each other,
whichever is greater: |offset diff| ≤max(0.2 · reference duration, 50 ms) (Raffel et al., 2014)."
EVALUATION,0.2808988764044944,"While these three metrics are standard for music transcription models, they offer only a limited view
of the performance of a multi-instrument model, as none consider which instrument is predicted to
play which notes in a sequence. This is due to the facts that (1) most prior music transcription models
were limited to single-instrument transcription, and (2) even most multi-instrument transcription
models did not assign speciﬁc instruments to predicted notes; we also believe the lack of a true
multi-instrument metric has led to this gap in prior work. Thus, we also propose and evaluate our
models’ performance using a novel metric which we call multi-instrument F1."
EVALUATION,0.2846441947565543,"Multi-instrument F1 adds to the Onset-Offset F1 score the additional requirement that the instru-
ment predicted to play a note must match the instrument of the reference note. This is a stricter
metric than the MV2H metric proposed in McLeod & Steedman (2018), as MV2H ignores off-
sets and also eliminates notes from ground-truth during evaluation of the instrument labels when
the pitch is not correctly detected; multi-instrument F1 is also more directly related to the existing
transcription metrics widely used in prior works."

This resembles the setup of many prior “multi-instrument” transcription works which transcribe
notes played by all instruments, without respect to their source. The MIDI Class grouping maps
instruments to their MIDI class (Table 8). This creates groupings of eight program numbers each,
with general classes for piano, guitar, bass, strings, brass, etc. The Full grouping retains instruments’
program numbers as annotated in the source dataset. This requires the model to distinguish notes
played by e.g. violin, viola, cello, all of which are grouped in the “strings” MIDI Class."

instrument datasets MusicNet and URMP; the mixture performance leads to an Onset-Offset F1 gain
of 54% on MusicNet and 263% on URMP. Our model outperforms other baselines speciﬁcally opti-
mized for low-resource datasets, such as Cheuk et al. (2021), while also remaining competitive with
or outperforming models tuned for large single-instrument datasets, i.e. Hawthorne et al. (2021)."
RESULTS,0.3707865168539326,"Instruments “in the wild” come in many different forms, and labeling exactly which sound sources
contain the same instrument is a necessary but nontrivial task. While the original General MIDI
1.0 speciﬁcation (1996) provides a 1:1 mapping of program numbers to 128 instruments4 and a
coarser grouping of these instruments into “classes” of eight program numbers (Table 8), these map-
pings are necessarily reductive: not all instruments are represented in the original 128 instruments
mapped to program numbers (e.g. ukulele), and other instruments (piano, organ, guitar) include
multiple program numbers which may be desirable to treat as a single instrument for the purposes
of transcription (e.g. transcribing program numbers 32-39 as a single “bass” class). To explore the
effect of instrument label granularity, we train and evaluate models with three levels of instrument
groupings: Flat, MIDI Class, and Full, shown in Table 3. We evaluate models at these three grouping
levels according to the multi-instrument transcription metric deﬁned in Section 4.2."
RESULTS,0.37453183520599254,"Table 3 demonstrates that our model makes few instrument label errors when it predicts onsets and
offsets correctly, even at the highest level of granularity (“Full”), as the multi-instrument F1 scores
are close to the onset-offset F1 scores in Table 2. We also provide an example transcription in Figure
3, which shows the distinct instrument tracks for an input from the Slakh2100 dataset. In addition to
our transcription results, we provide further experimental results in Appendix D. There, we assess
the ability of our approach to generalize to unseen datasets by conducting a set of leave-one-dataset-
out (LODO) experiments; we also provide evidence regarding the label quality of our datasets by
varying the onset and offset tolerance threshold used to compute F1 scores."

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.38202247191011235,"In this work we have shown that posing multi-instrument music transcription as a sequence-to-
sequence task and training a generic Transformer architecture simultaneously on a variety of
datasets advances the state of the art in multi-instrument transcription, most notably in the low-
resource scenario. We also introduced and applied a consistent evaluation method using note on-
set+offset+instrument F1 scores, using a standard instrument taxonomy."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.3857677902621723,"Our work suggests several future research directions. As labeled data for multi-instrument tran-
scription with realistic audio is very expensive, transcription models may beneﬁt from training on
unlabeled data, in a self- or semi-supervised fashion. There may also be value in a variety of data
augmentation strategies, e.g. mixing together unrelated examples to generate new training data.
Finally, high-quality AMT models such as ours present new frontiers for other musical modeling
tasks, such as generative music modeling (i.e. Dhariwal et al. (2020); Huang et al. (2018)); the tran-
scriptions from our model could be used as training data for a symbolic music generation model."

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS"
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS,0.40823970037453183,"One limitation of our system (and the baseline systems against which we compare) is that it is trained
on and applicable only to music from the “Western tradition”. The characteristic of Western music
most relevant to this work is that it is typically composed of discrete notes belonging to one of 12
pitch classes i.e. “C”, “C#”, “D”, etc. As such, music that does not have a well-deﬁned mapping
onto these 12 pitch classes is outside the scope of this work. This excludes many non-Western
musical traditions such as Indian ragas and Arabic maqams, and Western genres like the blues that
rely on microtonality. These types of music would be better suited to alternate representations e.g.
single or multiple non-discretized pitch tracks. We note that such data should also be considered
“low-resource” given the low availability of transcription datasets representing such traditions, and
represent an important area for future work. See Holzapfel et al. (2019) for a user study on existing
AMT systems in this context), and Viraraghavan et al. (2020) for an approach to transcription in one
non-Western domain."

t ∈[10ms, 500ms], and compute the Onset-Offset F1 for MT3 using threshold t for both onset

MusicNet: As the threshold increases, performance on datasets with high-quality timing labels tends
to level off to a baseline value. However, performance on URMP and MusicNet continues to increase
as the threshold increases, which is suggestive of large timing errors beyond the standard 50 ms
threshold used to evaluate the performance of all models in the experiments in our work."

labels). While there is visible evidence of labeling errors12 in the MusicNet dataset upon inspection,
