ABSTRACT,0.0033333333333333335,"Robustness to distribution shifts is critical for deploying machine learning mod-
els in the real world. Despite this necessity, there has been little work in deﬁn-
ing the underlying mechanisms that cause these shifts and evaluating the robust-
ness of algorithms across multiple, different distribution shifts. To this end, we
introduce a framework that enables ﬁne-grained analysis of various distribution
shifts. We provide a holistic analysis of current state-of-the-art methods by eval-
uating 19 distinct methods grouped into ﬁve categories across both synthetic and
real-world datasets. Overall, we train more than 85K models. Our experimental
framework can be easily extended to include new methods, shifts, and datasets.
We ﬁnd, unlike previous work (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021), that progress has
been made over a standard ERM baseline; in particular, pretraining and augmen-
tations (learned or heuristic) offer large gains in many cases. However, the best
methods are not consistent over different datasets and shifts. Code is available at
github.com/deepmind/distribution_shift_framework."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01,"If machine learning models are to be ubiquitous in critical applications such as driverless cars (Janai
et al., 2020), medical imaging (Erickson et al., 2017), and science (Jumper et al., 2021), it is pivotal
to build models that are robust to distribution shifts. Otherwise, models may fail surprisingly in ways
that derail trust in the system. For example, Koh et al. (2020); Perone et al. (2019); AlBadawy et al.
(2018); Heaven (2020); Castro et al. (2020) ﬁnd that a model trained on one set of hospitals may not
generalise to the imaging conditions of another; Alcorn et al. (2019); Dai & Van Gool (2018) ﬁnd
that a model for driverless cars may not generalise to new lighting conditions or object poses; and
Buolamwini & Gebru (2018) ﬁnd that a model may perform worse on subsets of the distribution,
such as different ethnicities, if the training set has an imbalanced distribution. Thus, it is important
to understand when we expect a model to generalise and when we do not. This would allow a
practitioner to have conﬁdence in the system (e.g. if a model is demonstrated to be robust to the
imaging conditions of different hospitals, then it can be deployed in new hospitals with conﬁdence)."
INTRODUCTION,0.013333333333333334,"While domain generalization is a well studied area, Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz (2021); Schott et al.
(2021) have cast doubt on the efﬁcacy of existing methods, raising the question: has any progress
been made in domain generalization over a standard expectation risk minimization (ERM) algo-
rithm? Despite these discouraging results, there are many examples that machine learning models
do generalise across datasets with different distributions. For example, CLIP (Radford et al., 2021),
with well engineered prompts, generalizes to many standard image datasets. Taori et al. (2020)
found that models trained on one image dataset generalise to another, albeit with some drop in
performance; in particular, higher performing models generalise better. However, there is little un-
derstanding and experimentation on when and why models generalise, especially in realistic settings
inspired by real-world applications. This begs the following question:"
INTRODUCTION,0.016666666666666666,Can we deﬁne the important distribution shifts to be robust to and then systematically evaluate the
INTRODUCTION,0.02,robustness of different methods?
INTRODUCTION,0.023333333333333334,"To answer the above question, we present a grounded understanding of robustness to distribution
shifts. We draw inspiration from disentanglement literature (see section 6), which aims to separate
images into an independent set of factors of variation (or attributes). In brief, we assume the data"

INTRODUCTION,0.03,"is composed of some (possibly extremely large) set of attributes. We expect models, having seen
some distribution of values for an attribute, to be able to learn invariance to that attribute and so to
generalise to unseen examples of the attribute and different distributions over that attribute. Using
a simple example to clarify the setup, assume our data has two attributes (shape and color) among
others. Given data with some distribution over the set of possible colors (e.g. red and blue) and the
task of predicting shape (e.g. circle or square), we want our model to generalise to unseen colors
(e.g. green) or a different distribution of colors (e.g. there are very few red circles in the training set,
but the samples at evaluation are uniformly sampled from the set of possible colors and shapes)."
INTRODUCTION,0.03333333333333333,"Using this framework, we evaluate models across three distribution shifts: spurious correlation, low-
data drift, and unseen data shift (illustrated in ﬁgure 1) and two additional conditions (label noise
and dataset size). We choose these settings as they arise in the real world and harm generalization
performance. Moreover, in our framework, these distribution shifts are the fundamental blocks of
building more complex distribution shifts. We additionally evaluate models when there is varying
amounts of label noise (as inspired by noise arising from human raters) and when the total size of
the train set varies (to understand how models perform as the number of training examples changes).
The unique ability of our framework to evaluate ﬁne-grained performance of models across different
distribution shifts and under different conditions is of critical importance to analyze methods under
a variety of real-world settings. This work makes the following contributions:"

framework to create a systematic evaluation setup across real and synthetic datasets for dif-
ferent distribution shifts. Our evaluation framework is easily extendable to new distribution
shifts, datasets, or methods to be evaluated.

shifts. However, there is no easy way to select the best approach a-priori and results are
inconsistent over different datasets and attributes, demonstrating there is still much work to
be done to improve robustness in real-world settings."

or other confounding factors in data collection, we are only able to train and test our models on data
collected from two related but distinct distributions: ptrain, ptest. For example, ptrain and ptest may
be concentrated on different subsets of hospitals and this discrepancy may result in a distribution

LATENT FACTORISATION,0.09666666666666666,"While generalization in the above sense is desirable for machine learning models, it is not clear why
a model f trained on data from ptrain should generalise to ptest. It is worth noting that while ptrain
and ptest can be different, they are both related to the true distribution p. We take inspiration from
disentanglement literature to express this relationship. In particular, that we can view data as being
decomposed into an underlying set of factors of variations. We formalise various distribution shifts
using a latent variable model for the true data generation process:"

tributes with a conditional generative model. We assume that distribution shifts arise when a new
marginal distribution for the attributes is chosen, such as p(y1:K) 6= ptrain(y1:K) 6= ptest(y1:K),
but otherwise the conditional generative model is shared across all distributions, i.e., we have

LATENT FACTORISATION,0.12,"To provide more context, as a running example, we use the color DSPRITES dataset (Matthey et al.,
2017); where in our notation y1 deﬁnes the color with A1 = {red, green, blue}, and y2 deﬁnes the
shape with A2 = {ellipse, heart, square}. We can imagine that a data collector (intentionally or im-
plicitly) selects some marginal distribution over attributes ptrain(y1:K) when training; for example
they select mostly blue ellipses and red hearts. This induces a new joint distribution over latent fac-
tors and attributes: ptrain(z, y1:K) = p(z|y1:K)ptrain(y1:K). Consequently, during training, we get
images with a different joint distribution ptrain(x, y1:K) = R"
LATENT FACTORISATION,0.12333333333333334,"p(x|z)ptrain(z, y1:K). This similarly

real-world challenges. We discuss these shifts and two additional, real-world inspired conditions."

DISTRIBUTION SHIFTS,0.19333333333333333,"Shift 1: Spurious correlation – Attributes are correlated under ptrain but not ptest.
Spurious
correlation arises in the wild for a number of reasons including capture bias, environmental factors,
and geographical bias (Beery et al., 2018; Torralba & Efros, 2011). These spurious correlations
lead to surprising results and poor generalization. Therefore, it is important to be able to build
models that are robust to such challenges. In our framework, spurious correlation arises when two
attributes ya, yb are correlated at training time, but this is not true of ptest, for which attributes are
independent: ptrain(ya|y1 . . . yb . . . yK) > ptrain(ya|y1 . . . yb−1, yb+1 . . . yK). This is especially
problematic when one attribute yb is yl, the label. Using the running DSPRITES example, shape and
color may be correlated and the model may ﬁnd it easier to predict color. If color is the label, the
model will generalise well. However, if the aim is to predict shape, the model’s reliance on color
will lead to poor generalization."

ties) when data has not been collected uniformly across different attributes. When deploying models

may be seen at training time, yet in ptest all colors are sampled with equal probability."

This is a special case of shift 2: low-data drift which we make explicit due to its important real world
applications. Unseen data shift arises when a model, trained in one setting is expected to work in
another, disjoint setting. For example: a model trained to classify animals on images at certain times
of day should generalise to other times of day. In our framework, unseen data shift arises when
some values in the set Aa of an attribute ya are unseen in ptrain but are in ptest:"

We perform a sweep over the hyperparameters (the precise sweeps are
given in appendix F.8). We run each set of hyperparameters for ﬁve seeds for each setting. To
choose the best model for each seed, we perform model selection over all hyperparameters using the
top-1 accuracy on the validation set. In the low-data and spurious correlation settings, we choose a
different set of samples from the low-data region with each seed. We report the mean and standard
deviation over the ﬁve seeds."
TAKEAWAYS,0.2966666666666667,"4.1
TAKEAWAYS"
TAKEAWAYS,0.3,"Takeaway 1: While we can improve over ERM, no one method always performs best. The
relative performance between methods varies across datasets and shifts. Under spurious correlation
(ﬁgure 3), CYCLEGAN consistently performs best but in ﬁgure 4, under low-data drift, pretraining
consistently performs best. Under unseen data shift (ﬁgure 5), pretraining is again one of the best
performing models. However, if we drill down on the results in ﬁgure 10 (appendix B.1), we can
see pretraining performs best on the synthetic datasets, but not on CAMELYON17 (where using
augmentation or DANN is best) or IWILDCAM (where using ViT or an MLP is best)."
TAKEAWAYS,0.30333333333333334,"Takeaway 2: Pretraining is a powerful tool across different shifts and datasets. While pre-
training is not always helpful (e.g. in appendix B.1 on CAMELYON17 in ﬁgures 10-11, IWILDCAM
in ﬁgures 10-11), it often provides a strong boost in performance. This is presumably because the
representation z learned during pretraining is helpful for the downstream task. For example, the
representation may have been trained to be invariant to certain useful properties (e.g. scale, shift,
and color). If these properties are useful on the downstream tasks, then the learned representation
should improve generalization."
TAKEAWAYS,0.30666666666666664,"Takeaway 3: Heuristic augmentation improves generalization if the augmentation describes
an attribute. In all settings (ﬁgures 3-5), ImageNet augmentation generally improves performance.
However, RandAugment, AugMix, and AutoAugment have more variable performance (as further
shown in ﬁgures 10-12). These methods are compositions of different augmentations. We investigate
the impact of each augmentation in RandAugment in appendix B.2 and ﬁnd variable performance.
Augmentations that approximate the true underlying generative model p(x|y1:K) lead to the best
results; otherwise, the model may waste capacity. For example, on CAMELYON17 (which consists
of cell images), color jitter harms performance but on SHAPES3D and MPI3D it is essential."
TAKEAWAYS,0.31,"Takeaway 4: Learned data augmentation is effective across different conditions and distribu-
tion shifts. This approach is highly effective in the spurious correlation setting (ﬁgure 3). It can
also help in the low-data and unseen data shift settings (ﬁgure 4,5) (though the gains for these two
shifts are not as large as for pretraining). The effectiveness of this approach can be explained by the
fact that if the augmentations are learned perfectly, then augmented samples by design are from the
true underlying generative model and can cover missing parts of the distribution."
TAKEAWAYS,0.31333333333333335,"Takeaway 5: Domain generalization algorithms offer limited performance improvement. In
some cases these methods (in particular DANN) do improve performance, most notably in the low-
data drift and unseen data shift settings (ﬁgures 4-5). However, this depends on the dataset (see
ﬁgures 10-12) and performance is rarely much better than using heuristic augmentation."

TAKEAWAYS,0.32,"Figure 6: Condition 1: Noisy labels. We vary
the amount of noise p in the labels. We plot the
percentage change over the baseline ResNet, av-
eraged over all seeds and datasets."

total size of the dataset T. We plot the percentage
change over the baseline ResNet, averaged over
all seeds and datasets."
TAKEAWAYS,0.32666666666666666,"Takeaway 6: The best algorithms may differ under the precise conditions. When labels have
varying noise in ﬁgure 6, relative performance is reasonably consistent. When the dataset size
decreases in ﬁgure 7, heuristic augmentation methods perform poorly. However, using pretraining
and learned augmentation is consistently robust."
TAKEAWAYS,0.33,"Takeaway 7: The precise attributes we consider directly impacts the results. For example, on
DSPRITES, if we make color yl and shape ya, we ﬁnd that all methods generalise perfectly in the
unseen data shift setting (as demonstrated in appendix B.3) unlike when shape is yl (ﬁgure 10)."
PRACTICAL TIPS,0.3333333333333333,"4.2
PRACTICAL TIPS"
PRACTICAL TIPS,0.33666666666666667,"While there is no free lunch in terms of the method to choose, we recommend the following tips."
PRACTICAL TIPS,0.34,"Tip 1: If heuristic augmentations approximate part of the true underlying generative model,
use them. Under this constraint, heuristic augmentations can signiﬁcantly improve performance;
this should be a ﬁrst point of call. How to heuristically choose these augmentations without exhaus-
tively trying all possible combinations is an open research question."
PRACTICAL TIPS,0.3433333333333333,"Tip 2: If heuristic augmentations do not help, learn the augmentation. If the true underlying
generative model cannot be readily approximated with heuristic techniques, but some subset of the
generative model can be learned by conditioning on known attributes, this is a promising way to
further improve performance. How to learn the underlying generative model directly from data and
use this for augmentation is a promising area to explore more thoroughly."
PRACTICAL TIPS,0.3466666666666667,"Tip 3: Use pretraining. In general, pretraining was found to be a useful way to learn a robust rep-
resentation. While this was not true for all datasets (e.g. CAMELYON17, IWILDCAM), performance
could be dramatically improved by pretraining (DSPRITES, MPI3D, SMALLNORB, SHAPES3D).
An area to be investigated is the utility of self-supervised pre-training."
PRACTICAL TIPS,0.35,"Tip 4: More complex approaches lead to limited improvements. Domain generalization, adap-
tive approaches and disentangling lead to limited improvements, if any, across the different datasets
and shifts. Of these approaches, DANN performs generally best. How to make these approaches
generically useful for robustness is still an open research question."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.3566666666666667,"Our experiments demonstrate that no one method performs best over all shifts and that performance
is dependent on the precise attribute being considered. This leads to the following considerations."
DISCUSSION,0.36,"There is no way to decide a-priori on the best method given only the dataset. It would be
helpful for practitioners to be able to select the best approaches without requiring comprehensive
evaluations and comparisons. Moreover, it is unclear how to pinpoint the precise distribution shift
(and thereby methods to explore) in a given application. This should be an important future area of
investigation."

DISCUSSION,0.37,"considered. Instead of trying to make one algorithm for any possible shift, it makes sense to have
adaptable algorithms which can use auxiliary information if given. Moreover, algorithms should be
evaluated in the context for which we will use them."
DISCUSSION,0.37333333333333335,"It is pivotal to evaluate methods in a variety of conditions.
Performance varies due to the
number of examples, amount of noise, and size of the dataset. Thus it is important to perform
comprehensive evaluations when comparing different methods, as in our framework. This gives
others a more realistic view of different models’ relative performance in practice."

RELATED WORK,0.38333333333333336,"Benchmarking robustness to out of distribution (OOD) generalization.
While a multitude of
methods exist that report improved OOD generalization, Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz (2021) found that
in actuality no evaluated method performed signiﬁcantly better than a strong ERM baseline on a
variety of datasets. However, Hendrycks et al. (2021) found that, when we focus on better aug-
mentation, larger models and pretraining, we can get a sizeable boost in performance. This can be
seen on the Koh et al. (2020) benchmark (the largest boosts come from larger models and better
augmentation). Our work is complementary to these methods, as we look at a range of approaches
(pretraining, heuristic augmentation, learned augmentation, domain generalisation, adaptive, disen-
tangled representations) on a range of both synthetic and real-world datasets. Moreover, we allow
for a ﬁne-grained analysis of methods over different distribution shifts."
RELATED WORK,0.38666666666666666,"Benchmarking spurious correlation and low-data drift.
Studies on fairness and bias (surveyed
by Mehrabi et al. (2021)) have demonstrated the pernicious impact of low-data in face recognition
(Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018), medical imaging (Castro et al., 2020), and conservation (Beery et al.,
2018) and spurious correlation in classiﬁcation (Geirhos et al., 2019) and conservation (Beery et al.,
2020). Arjovsky et al. (2019) hypothesized that spurious correlation may be the underlying reason
for poor generalization of models to unseen data. To our knowledge, there has been no large scale
work focused on understanding the beneﬁts of different methods across these distribution shifts
systematically across multiple datasets and with ﬁne-grained control on the amount of shift. Here
we introduce a framework for creating these shifts in a controllable way to allow such challenges to
be investigated robustly."
RELATED WORK,0.39,"Benchmarking disentangled representations.
A related area, disentangled representation learn-
ing, aims to learn a representation where the factors of variation in the data are separated. If this
could be achieved, then models should be able to generalise effortlessly to unseen data as inves-
tigated in multiple settings such as reinforcement learning (Higgins et al., 2017b). Despite many
years of work in disentangled representations (Higgins et al., 2017a; Burgess et al., 2017; Kim &
Mnih, 2018; Chen et al., 2018), a benchmark study by Locatello et al. (2019) found that, without
supervision or implicit model or data assumptions, one cannot reliably perform disentanglement;
however, weak supervision appears sufﬁcient to do so (Locatello et al., 2020). Dittadi et al. (2021);
Schott et al. (2021); Montero et al. (2020) further investigated whether representations (disentan-
gled or not) can interpolate, extrapolate, or compose properties; they found that when considering
complex combinations of properties and multiple datasets, representations do not do so reliably."

CONCLUSIONS"
CONCLUSIONS,0.39666666666666667,"This work has put forward a general, comprehensive framework to reason about distribution shifts.
We analyzed 19 different methods, spanning a range of techniques, over three distribution shifts –
spurious correlation, low-data drift, and unseen data shift, and two additional conditions – label
noise and dataset size. We found that while results are not consistent across datasets and methods, a
number of methods do better than an ERM baseline in some settings. We then put forward a number
of practical tips, promising directions, and open research questions. We hope that our framework and
comprehensive benchmark spurs research on in this area and provides a useful tool for practitioners
to evaluate which methods work best under which conditions and shifts."
