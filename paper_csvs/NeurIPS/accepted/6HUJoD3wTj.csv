ABSTRACT,0.0015015015015015015,Abstract
ABSTRACT,0.003003003003003003,"Transformer architectures have been widely adopted in foundation models. Due to
their high inference costs, there is renewed interest in exploring the potential of
efficient recurrent architectures (RNNs). In this paper, we analyze the differences in
the representational capabilities of Transformers and RNNs across several tasks of
practical relevance, including index lookup, nearest neighbor, recognizing bounded
Dyck languages, and string equality. For the tasks considered, our results show
separations based on the size of the model required for different architectures. For
example, we show that a one-layer Transformer of logarithmic width can perform
index lookup, whereas an RNN requires a hidden state of linear size. Conversely,
while constant-size RNNs can recognize bounded Dyck languages, we show that
one-layer Transformers require a linear size for this task. Furthermore, we show
that two-layer Transformers of logarithmic size can perform decision tasks such as
string equality or disjointness, whereas both one-layer Transformers and recurrent
models require linear size for these tasks. We also show that a log-size two-layer
Transformer can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm in its forward pass; on
the other hand recurrent models require linear size. Our constructions are based
on the existence of N nearly orthogonal vectors in O(log N) dimensional space
and our lower bounds are based on reductions from communication complexity
problems. We supplement our theoretical results with experiments that highlight the
differences in the performance of these architectures on practical-size sequences."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.006006006006006006,"Transformers [59] are the go-to architecture for building LLMs [11], but recently, there has been
significant interest in reviving recurrent architectures to build LLMs for practical tasks [21, 42, 45] to
circumvent the quadratic complexity of inference for Transformers. While Transformers process all
tokens in parallel, maintaining N vectors, and are in some sense stateless, recurrent models primarily
store information in a fixed-size hidden state that they can update during the course of the computation.
This raises a fundamental question that we explore: Are there tasks that are computationally easier
for one architecture to represent but significantly more difficult for the other one?"
INTRODUCTION,0.0075075075075075074,"Ever since Transformers supplanted LSTMs, there has been significant interest in understanding the
differences in the computational capabilities of the models both theoretically and empirically. On the
one hand, even as Transformers have been widely adopted for building LLMs, several studies found
that they struggled at modeling various formal languages, particularly those that required modular
counting or state-tracking [5, 16, 38]. At the same time, despite substantial effort, it has proven
hard to match the performance of Transformer-based LLMs at scale with recurrent architectures
[15, 45, 21]; in particular, it has been observed that LLMs based on recurrent models struggle on
associative recall or extraction-related tasks [15, 2]. More recently, Arora et al. [2] and Bhattamishra"

INTRODUCTION,0.010510510510510511,"et al. [8] demonstrated that Transformers are better than attention-free models at synthetic tasks based
on associative recall and more general forms such as implementing nearest neighbors. Based on
these observations, it is natural to wonder if such tasks are theoretically easier for Transformers to
represent in comparison to recurrent models."
INTRODUCTION,0.012012012012012012,"Our Contributions. We show differences in the representational capabilities of Transformers and
recurrent models across several natural tasks of real-world relevance. In this paper, we show strong
separation results: when a task is easy we show that it can be expressed by one architecture with
size poly-logarithmic in the input length N; on the other hand we show the other type of architecture
requires the size to be linear in N. We describe the tasks studied and our key results below."
INTRODUCTION,0.013513513513513514,"(i) Index Lookup. Given a sequence of symbols s1, . . . , sN followed by a position p ∈[N], a model
has to output the symbol in the p-th position sp (Figure 1a). Our first result shows that one-layer
Transformers with size poly-logarithmic in N can express this task (Theorem 1) whereas any recurrent
model must have width Ω(N) to perform this task (Theorem 3)."
INTRODUCTION,0.015015015015015015,"(ii) Bounded Dycks. Dyck languages with bounded depth require a model to recognize whether a
string of parentheses is well-balanced (Figure 1b). These formal languages have received a great deal
of attention in the study of neural sequence models because they capture hierarchical dependencies
that occur in natural languages [17, 25, 23, 6]. They are also central to formal language theory as all
context-free languages can be expressed in terms of Dyck languages [14]. In contrast to the results
for index lookup, we show that one-layer Transformers must have a size that grows linearly in input
length to represent this task (Theorem 5), whereas prior works found that constant-size recurrent
models can express this task [25, 6]."
INTRODUCTION,0.016516516516516516,"(iii) String Equality. This task is formalized by the Equality function EQ(x, y) = I[x = y] where
x, y are two strings of length N; it models the natural task of matching two documents. We show that
log-sized two-layer Transformers can represent the function EQ (Theorem 6), whereas both one-layer
Transformers (Theorem 12) and recurrent models (Theorem 11) must have a size that grows linearly
with the sequence length. These results extend to a broader class of Boolean functions."
INTRODUCTION,0.018018018018018018,"(iv) Nearest Neighbor and Associative Recall. In this task, a model is provided with a sequence of
inputs and labels x1, y1, . . . , xk−1, yk−1 followed by a query input xk. The model has to determine
the label yk of the query input by applying the nearest neighbor algorithm in its forward pass
(Figure 1c). This task subsumes various associative recall tasks considered in earlier works (cf.
Appendix G) and was introduced to understand in-context learning. Bhattamishra et al. [8] found
empirical differences in the performance of Transformers and attention-free architectures, though
theoretical understanding is lacking. We show that a two-layer Transformer with size logarithmic in
the input length can perform this task (Theorem 7), whereas recurrent models require a size linear in
the length (Theorem 8)."
INTRODUCTION,0.01951951951951952,"We also empirically investigated the performance of Transformers and standard recurrent models
[26], including recently proposed state-space models [22, 21] on these tasks. The observed behavior
is along the lines indicated by our theoretical results."
INTRODUCTION,0.021021021021021023,"Our Techniques. For constructing Transformers that perform the tasks, one of the key requirements
is the ability to precisely attend to specific positions. In order to do this with low-dimensional
embeddings, our constructions make use of nearly orthogonal vectors obtained using the Johnson-
Lindenstrauss lemma [29]; furthermore these can be generated efficiently in logarithmic space which
allows the size of the models to be poly-logarithmic in the input length (cf. Appendix B.3)."
INTRODUCTION,0.02252252252252252,"For our lower bounds, we appeal to results from communication complexity. We show how to
obtain protocols with communication complexity bounded by the size of the models. Together
with established (and new) communication complexity lower bounds, we obtain lower bounds on
the model size. For our lower bound for one-layer Transformers, we derive a lower bound on the
communication complexity for bounded Dyck languages (Lemma 1)."

Index Lookup Task"

receives a sequence of tokens s1, . . . , sN (possibly with repetitions) followed by an index p where
p ∈[N] and the goal of the model is to output the token sp. Here the symbols si belong to a finite
alphabet Σ."

more general results in this paper: On the one hand, we show how a one-layer Transformer with width
O(log N) can perform this task; on the other hand, we use communication complexity arguments to
show that any type of recurrent or state-space model performing this task needs a hidden state with
representation size Ω(N)."

that performs the Index Lookup task for all input sequences of length at most N. Naïvely one
could construct such a transformer by using one-hot encodings as positional embeddings, as they
are orthogonal and would allow to attend to the desired index. However, this would require the
embedding dimension, and hence the width of the model, to be Ω(N). Key to our constructions of a
width O(log N) Transformer, both here and in other sections, is a result (Lemma 2 in the Appendix)
which states that, in k = O(log N/γ2) dimensional space we can find N nearly orthogonal vectors.
We use such vectors in our construction of the Transformers to allow it to attend almost exactly over

use the N almost orthogonal vectors provided by Lemma 2, both as positional embeddings and also
as a way to embed the numbers {1, . . . , N}, any of which can be used as the index p. Formally, let
T (1), . . . , T (N) be N vectors of dimension k = O(log N) such that ⟨T (i), T (j)⟩≤1/4 for i ̸= j

that the output of an RNN can be computed with a bounded amount of communication when Alice

can represent the Index Lookup task can also compute the INDEX problem and since that implies the
existence of a one-way communication protocol with mp bits (Theorem 2), it follows that the width

formers and recurrent models process sequences. Since Transformers have access to N input vectors
during their computation, a small-sized attention block can attend over the desired input vector to
make the correct prediction. On the other hand, any recurrent model—even with arbitrary positional
embeddings—must store all the required information in its hidden state, which lower bounds the size
of such models to compute the right output. These intuitions are made rigorous by showing (i) how
soft-attention can do lookup using the almost orthogonal vectors, and (ii) small-width RNNs yield
a short one-way communication protocol. These lower bounds also apply to causal forms of linear
attention architectures where softmax is removed and attention weights become dot products [31]."

overhead that is logarithmic in the input length. The key property here is that this protocol works

positions in the string, respectively. Intuitively, in such a situation, Alice needs to know almost all of
the bits available to Bob in order to decide whether a given string is well-bracketed–and vice versa.
More formally, they need to exchange at least N −1 bits to decide membership in Dyck-(2, 2):

bound for any partition is sufficient to establish lower bounds on the size of the Transformer. For
Dyck-(2, 2), contiguous partitions are not a hard case, and in fact, communicating ≤2 open brackets
from the first half is sufficient. This is why the lower bound of Lemma 1 does not apply to RNNs."

as EQ(x) = I[(x1, . . . , xN/2) = (xN/2+1, . . . , xN)]. A related problem is Disjointness: given two
vectors x, y ∈{0, 1}N/2, the function DISJ(x, y) = max xiyi = I[xT y > 0]. Both the functions
Equality and Disjointness are known to have communication complexity Ω(N) (see Appendix B.1)
and Theorems 4 and 2 imply that both one-layer Transformers and RNNs must have width Ω(N)
to represent them. In the next section, we show that these lower bounds do not apply to two-layer
Transformers. Additionally, it is worth noting that the functions EQ and DISJ can also be expressed
in the form of 2-CNFs with O(N) terms. Hence, a more general consequence of the limitations of
RNNs (and one-layer Transformers) is that with width o(N), they cannot compute certain functions
in the class of uniform AC0.3 It is interesting since the class of uniform AC0 is considered one of the
simplest classes of Boolean circuits and even the expressive power of hard-attention Transformers
has been shown to be within this class [24]. In Appendix F.1, we provide an alternate proof of the
lower bound for RNNs computing Equality based on their relation to DFAs."

REPRESENTING BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS,0.11261261261261261,"The construction is based on tools developed in Section 3. The broad idea is as follows. In the
first layer, at each position i > N/2, an attention head attends to position i −N/2 and copies the
input xi−N/2. A feedforward network then checks whether the retrieved value is equal to xi. The
second layer simply uses uniform attention over the outputs of the previous layer to check if there is
a mismatch at any position. Importantly, we show that the above strategy can be implemented with a
representation size O((log N)3)."

information to retrieve the desired label. There are a few challenges to implementing this strategy
which we address in our construction. First, note that for input vectors x1, . . . , xk, naively using
them with dot-product attention will result in the query input xk having maximum dot product and
hence maximum attention weight over itself. Second, the dot product with some label vectors yis
could be higher than the dot product with the nearest neighbor xj∗. Third, the positional information
must be retrieved using soft-attention in a way that it can be used in the next layer to obtain the
desired label. Our intuitive, though somewhat involved, construction deals with these issues to ensure
that a two-layer Transformer with O((log N)3) total size implements the nearest neighbor algorithm.

when the sequence length is much larger than the size of the hidden state or width of the model, then
the model will be incapable of representing the task and consequently fail to learn the task. However,

Discussion and Final Remarks"
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.18618618618618618,"Based on prior theoretical results, it is known that, while recurrent models can express any regular
language [34, 33], Transformers with logarithmic precision can only express languages in the class
of uniform constant depth threshold circuits (TC0) [40]. These results indicate that—under standard
conjectures—Transformers are unable to represent certain state-tracking tasks that recurrent models
can represent. With such results, it might appear that Transformers are less expressive than recurrent
models–potentially at odds with the persistent practical success of Transformer-based LLMs. Our
findings, however, show that when the model size is constrained relative to the sequence length,
a variety of tasks relevant to practice can be represented by small-sized Transformers but not by
recurrent models. Our results suggest that the attention mechanism does lead to expressiveness that
cannot be replicated by recurrent architectures even with arbitrary transition functions."
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.18768768768768768,"Limitations. A general limitation of this line of work is that positive expressivity results do not
imply that the problems under consideration are learnable. Additionally, while lower bounds for an
architecture imply difficulty in learning, when using double precision these results only apply to very
long sequences in practice. Our results (and probably techniques) do not imply any limitations on
two-layer Transformers; this is left as an open question. We note that communication complexity-
based techniques akin to Theorem 4 cannot exist for two-layer Transformers (cf. Appendix F.4).
Hence, we believe that other tools will be needed to prove lower bounds for two-layer Transformers."

Clarifications"
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.26876876876876876,(1) What do the results presented in the paper imply about the learnability of the tasks considered?
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.2702702702702703,"The lower bounds on recurrent models and one-layer Transformers have negative implications for
learnability but the positive results do not have any nontrivial implications. The lower bounds on
the size of recurrent models and one-layer Transformers imply that unless the width of the models
grows linearly with respect to the input length, they cannot represent and consequently cannot learn
such tasks. Note, however, that even though the input length need not be unboundedly long for our
lower bounds to apply, they still need to be sufficiently large N ≳m and do not apply at the lengths"
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.27177177177177175,"considered in our experiments. The results indicating that Transformers can express tasks like Index
lookup, string equality or nearest neighbors do not imply that they can learn those tasks in practice.
The experiments in Sections 6 and H as well as from prior works [8] seem to indicate that small-sized
Transformers perform reasonably well on these tasks."
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.2732732732732733,"(2) For the upper bounds on the total size of Transformers to express functions, does it include the
input and positional embeddings or just the Transformer model with attention and feedforward block?"
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.2747747747747748,"Yes, when we say that Transformers with total size O(f(N)) or poly-logarithmic in N can express a
certain task, it includes the input and positional embeddings. The total representation size indicates
the total number of bits required to represent all the parameters of the model. Our results imply that a
Transformer with total size O((log N)3) can represent tasks such as nearest neighbors, Equality, etc,
whereas the size of any recurrent model must be Ω(N). For our constructions of Transformers, we
ensure that the positional embeddings can be generated in log space (discussed in Appendix B) and
need not be stored as a N × d matrix for the required computations. Lastly, it is worth noting that all
our lower bounds for recurrent models apply even if they have arbitrary positional embeddings stored
in N × d matrix, and hence the size of recurrent models is Ω(N) excluding the embeddings."
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.27627627627627627,"(3) For the constructions with Transformers, why can’t those results follow from some frameworks
like RASP?"
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.2777777777777778,"RASP [61, 36] is a programming language aiming to abstract computations that transformers can
compute. While one might be able to construct RASP programs for some of the tasks we have
considered, such as Index Lookup, such constructions would not entail results similar to ours, because
RASP substantially abstracts from implementational aspects. For instance, RASP allows MLPs to
compute arbitrary functions, and attention is not computed from dot products of keys and queries.
It is not clear if general-purpose translations from RASP to realistic transformers would be able to
recover our efficient bounds, e.g., logarithmic size."
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.27927927927927926,(4) Do the negative results in experiments imply that those architectures cannot learn those tasks?
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.2807807807807808,"The differences in the performance of models apply more to the rate of learning than a binary form
of success/failure. For instance, in the Index Lookup task, one can see that in Figure 2, one-layer
Transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy in a few thousand steps whereas recurrent models fail to
achieve high accuracy even after being trained for 25× steps. It can still be true that if the models are
trained for much longer or are much bigger, they might achieve high accuracy. See Figure 3 which
depicts the performance of Mamba across various sizes and lengths. For tasks like Index lookup,
we observe that Transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy across several learning rates whereas
recurrent architectures fail on all the learning rates we tried. A similar thing is true for other tasks
such as Dyck-(2, 2) where one-layer Transformers seem to learn at a much slower rate compared to
LSTMs and two-layer Transformers even for the lengths where they do achieve near-perfect accuracy."
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.2822822822822823,"(5) Do the lower bounds for Transformers and RNNs apply with additional components such as layer
norm, residual connections, positional embeddings, etc?"
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.28378378378378377,"Yes, for our lower bounds for one-layer Transformers and Recurrent models, they still apply if the
models have additional components including arbitrary positional embeddings, layer norms, etc. We
only assume that the attention mechanism operates over finite precision and the hidden state of RNN
is in finite precision. The results do not make any assumptions about the computational limits of the
remaining components. They apply even when the output of the attention block or the hidden state of
an RNN is processed by an arbitrary function."

DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.28678678678678676,"B.1
Communication Complexity"
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.2882882882882883,"Our lower bounds for recurrent models and 1-layer Transformers are based on communication-
complexity bounds. We assume some familiarity with communication complexity (see Rao and
Yehudayoff [48], Kushilevitz and Nisan [35] for an introduction). We will primarily focus on the
two-party setting where the communication complexity of a function indicates the number of bits two
parties must exchange in order to compute the output of a function. If Alice and Bob want to compute
a function f : {0, 1}N →{0, 1} where Alice has the bits in the indices I ⊂[N] and Bob has the bits
in indices [N] \ I, the communication complexity of f over that partition is the minimum number"
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.2897897897897898,"of bits they must exchange to compute the output for all inputs x ∈{0, 1}N. Alice and Bob are
allowed unbounded computational power. If Alice and Bob must exchange at least k bits to compute
a function f(x) ∀x ∈{0, 1}n over any partition of the input then we say that the communication
complexity C(f) ≥k. If they use a communication protocol where only one party is allowed to send
bits to the other party, then it is called one-way communication, and the communication complexity
of the function in that setting is referred to as one-way communication complexity."
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.2912912912912913,"For our results, we will use the following three well-known facts about the communication complexity
of the Disjointness, Equality, and the INDEX problem."
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.2927927927927928,"Disjointness. The disjointness function takes two sets A, B ⊆[N] as input and returns 0 if
the two sets are disjoint and returns 1 otherwise. This can also be seen as a function DISJ :
{0, 1}N ×{0, 1}N →{0, 1} over two Boolean inputs such that DISJ(a, b) = max aibi = I[aT b > 0].
If Alice has the input vector a ∈{0, 1}N and Bob has the vector b ∈{0, 1}N, then the communication
complexity of DISJ indicates the minimum number of bits that Alice and Bob will have to exchange to
determine the output of the DISJ function. The following is a well-known fact about the disjointness
problem,
Fact 1. (Disjointness [64]) If Alice and Bob have two inputs a, b ∈{0, 1}N, then any deterministic
communication protocol used by them to compute DISJ(a, b) = max aibi must exchange at least
N-bits. Moreover, the randomized communication complexity of the DISJ is Ω(N).
Fact 2. (Equality [48, Ch. 1]) If Alice and Bob have two inputs a, b ∈{0, 1}N, then any deterministic
communication protocol used by them to compute EQ(a, b) = I[a = b] must exchange at least N-bits.
Fact 3. (INDEX [27]) If Alice and Bob have two inputs a ∈{0, 1}N and b ∈[N] respectively, then
any deterministic communication protocol used by Alice to send bits to Bob must require N bits for
Bob to compute INDEX(a, b) = ab. Moreover, the one-way randomized communication complexity of
the INDEX is Ω(N)."
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.29429429429429427,"One thing to note about the Equality problem is that although the deterministic communication
complexity of the EQ problem is Ω(N), the randomized communication complexity is O(log N).
For the Disjointness and INDEX problems, the randomized communication complexity is Ω(N)
as well. In other words, even if the two parties are allowed to compute the output of the function
correctly with high probability (say > 2/3), even then the number of bits they must exchange is
Ω(N)."

Finite Precision Implementation"
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.2972972972972973,"In this work, we are interested in the expressiveness of finite precision models. For our constructions
with Transformers, we will work with p-bit numbers where p = Θ(log N) where N is the maximum
length of the input string."
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.2987987987987988,"In particular, for some sufficiently large constant Kc > 0, we will work with numbers between
−N Kc to N Kc with a step size of ∆=
1
NKc . If Qp is the set of all such numbers then Qp =
{−N Kc, −N Kc + ∆, . . . , 0, ∆, 2∆, . . . , N Kc}. Hence, the size of the set is |Qp| = N 2Kc
=⇒
p = 2Kc log N = Θ(log N). For any real number z ∈R, in the finite precision implementation, z is
rounded down to the nearest ˆz such that ˆzN Kc ∈Z. If z > N Kc, then z is rounded down to N Kc. In
our constructions with Transformers, all the parameters and intermediate values follow the above
implementation."

DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.36186186186186187,"Proof. For an input sequence (s1, . . . , sN, p), the Transformer uses the embeddings of the position
token p and the positional embeddings of the first N inputs to attend over sp, so that the feedforward
network can extract the label from the output of the attention block. Our key idea is to use the
N almost orthogonal vectors provided by Lemma 2, both as positional embeddings and also as a
way to embed the numbers {1, . . . , N}, any of which can be used as the index p. Formally, let
T (1), . . . , T (N) be N vectors of dimension k = O(log N) such that ⟨T (i), T (j)⟩≤1/4 for i ̸= j

are used for the positional embeddings. Suppose we use a binary encoding for symbols in Σ, and
ρ : Σ →{0, 1}log |Σ| is such that ρ(s) is the binary encoding of s ∈Σ. The token embedding of each

DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.38738738738738737,"Discussion. While we showed that a one-layer Transformer with O(log N) width can represent the
index lookup task, it is unclear whether a one-layer Transformer with a small width can express
the associative recall task. The construction above cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner
to show that one-layer Transformers can represent the associative recall task. From the results in
Section G on nearest neighbors, it follows that two-layer Transformers with logarithmic width can
express the associative recall task. At the same time, the lower bound techniques for one-layer
Transformers presented in Section D do not directly apply to the associative recall task and hence
it is not straightforward to prove that Transformers must have two layers in order to perform the
associative recall task."
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.3888888888888889,"The index lookup task serves a few purposes in our work. The result that it is in some sense
easier for Transformers and difficult for recurrent models may not be very surprising based on the
intuitive understanding of the architectures. Our results help theoretically formalize the intuitions that
Transformers can use attention to arbitrarily retrieve tokens whereas recurrent models must compress
the information in their hidden states. Secondly, the task helps us introduce the techniques that will
be used for the constructions and lower bounds to obtain more general results in the later sections.
Lastly, it serves as a simple task that separates one-layer Transformer and recurrent models. As
described above, it is not straightforward to show that the associative recall task can or cannot be
expressed by one-layer Transformers with small width but with the index lookup task, we have that
one-layer Transformers can represent them efficiently."

Dyck with Bounded Depths"
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.4444444444444444,"It is generally agreed that processing and comprehending natural language requires processing
hierarchical structures [e.g. 13, 18]. The fundamental computational problem here consists of
matching and relating material that matches hierarchically, even if it appears at a great linear distance.
This problem is formalized by the family of Dyck languages [14]: languages of well-matched words
over one or more types of parentheses. These languages formalize problems that can be solved with
access to a stack, where opening parentheses are pushed and closing parentheses are popped. Beyond
a fundamental model of hierarchical structure, they are of central importance in formal language
theory, as any context-free language can be expressed in terms of Dyck languages [14]. Perhaps due
to the boundedness of human memory [41], natural language tends to have more bounded levels of
embedding [30, 10]. This has motivated the study of bounded-depth Dyck languages as plausible
simple models of the hierarchical structure underlying language, with substantial interest in the
abilities of neural architectures to model them [25, 65, 6]."
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.44594594594594594,"We will primarily focus on Dyck-2 languages with depth at most k, denoted as Dyck-(2, k). The
Dyck-2 language contains two types of brackets, such as round brackets ‘(’, ‘)’ and square brackets
‘[’, ‘]’. The Dyck-(2, 2) language with depth at most 2 contains well-balanced parenthesis where for
any prefix, the number of unbalanced parentheses can be at most 2. For instance, the string ‘( [ ] ) [ ]’
has a depth at most 2 whereas the string ‘( [ [ ] ] )’ has a depth of 3. We say a model recognizes a
language if it can correctly classify whether or not a string belongs to the language. We will primarily
focus on strings with maximum length N and study how the size of a model depends on that."
DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.44744744744744747,"Our main result in this section is that any 1-layer Transformer that can recognize Dyck-2 with
bounded depths must have a width that grows linearly with the input length N. To show that, we will

Dyck-(2, 2) is exactly 2N−1 with some elementary combinatorics. First, see that the number of
Dyck-2 sequences of depth at most 1 and length N is exactly 2N/2. This is because the string is
made up of blocks of ‘()’ and ‘[]’, and hence there are two choices for every block. Then, consider a
block of Dyck-2 string of length k (where k is even) which starts and ends with an open and closing
bracket respectively. Moreover, the Dyck-2 string has a depth exactly 2, e.g. ‘[ () [] () ]’. Note that,
the total number of such strings of length k is exactly 2k/2 since there are two choices for the first
bracket and there is a Dyck-2 string of depth 1 and length k −2 inside it. For simplicity, we will call
such strings as belonging to the language Dyckb-(2, 2) which is a subset of the language Dyck-(2,
2). In simple terms, strings of length m in the subset Dyckb-(2, 2) have an overall depth 2 and have
a depth 1 string of length m −2 between the first symbol (open bracket) and the last symbol (closing

so on. For instance, a valid partition of the indices [1, 2, . . . , 8] into 3 blocks is [1, 2], [3, . . . , 6], and

a DFA with O(2k) states which is independent of the input length N. In particular, the language
Dyck-(2, 2) considered here can be represented by a DFA with just 7 states. Hence, it follows that
a recurrent model of constant size can represent the Dyck-(2, 2) language for arbitrary lengths in
a finite precision setting. Additionally, prior works have described constructions of such recurrent
models with practical activation functions such as Sigmoid [25] and ReLU [6]. Thus, the bounded

DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS,0.4984984984984985,"input — but not one-way. Hence, the types of lower bounds that apply to these two architectures are
different. For any function f such as the INDEX problem, if the one-way communication complexity
is lower bounded by Ω(N) over some contiguous partitions then it implies that for RNNs, the width
m = Ω(N/p). However since the two-way communication complexity of such problems might
be lower, those lower bounds need not apply to one-layer Transformers. For instance, the INDEX
problem can be solved with log N bits of communication if two-way communication is allowed or in
other words, Bob is allowed to send bits to Alice. Conversely, to prove lower bounds for Transformers
computing a certain function f, proving a communication complexity lower bound for f over any
partition of inputs suffices. For a particular partitioning of inputs, we showed a lower bound on the
communication complexity of bounded Dyck languages. While that result implies a lower bound
on one-layer Transformers, the partitioning is not contiguous and hence does not apply to recurrent
models. For Dyck-(2, 2), contiguous partitions are not a hard case, and in fact, communicating ≤2
open brackets from the first half is sufficient. This is why the lower bound of Lemma 1 does not
apply to RNNs. Despite these differences, for a large class of Boolean functions including functions
such as Equality and Disjointness, the lower bounds apply to both of these architectures."

caveat related to this DFA-based result which does not apply to the communication complexity-based
lower bounds. For the DFA-based result, while the transition function is allowed to be an arbitrary
function, it has to be of the form g(xt, ht−1),i.e., the functions cannot be different based on the
timestep t. It is unclear if the result still applies when the function is allowed to be different based
on the timestep. However, since the transition function is allowed to be any arbitrary function, it
still captures all the recurrent and state-space architectures used in practice. Additionally, this fairly
simple technique could be used to prove lower bounds for RNNs based on lower bounds in formal
language theory.

be less than 1/2N Kc and hence will be rounded to 0. Hence, for η ≥log N +Kc log 2N, the softmax

Representing more general class of Boolean functions"

desired position and retrieve a single bit. Extending that, using k heads, we can retrieve k bits from k
different positions. To compute gIi(x), we will have input embeddings of size 1 + (k + 1)r. For the
ith input xi, the first coordinate will contain the input xi ∈{−1, 1} and will contain 0 for the [BOS]

that Vh(xi) = xi at the coordinate h and is 0 everywhere else. The key transformation for each
head can be K(xi) = [T (i)] containing the vector corresponding to the token’s position. The query
transformation is distinct for each head, and for the jth head, the query vector contains jth block
from the last k blocks containing the positional vectors for each index in the set Ii. If the query and
key transformations are designed in such a way, then using the arguments described in Theorem 6, it
can be seen that the output of the attention block at the ith position will be a k dimensional vector
containing [xI1
i , . . . , xIk
i ]. If the set Ii has a size less than k, then the output vector will be followed
by zeros after |Ii| coordinates and will be a zero vector if Ii = ∅. Finally, the feedforward network
can then compute the function gIi(x) at every position which can be done by a network of constant
size because k = O(1) does not depend on N. The second layer can then compute the threshold over
the k-SPARSE features as described earlier which leads to the desired output."

to predict the label of the query input sk by finding the exact match from the context and producing
the corresponding label. A model that can compute the nearest neighbor algorithm can perform

[63] with the GPT-2 backbone as well as our own custom implementation. We use PyTorch’s standard
or in-built implementation for experiments with LSTMs. For state-space models like Mamba [21]
and Diagonal state-space models [22], we use the official implementation provided by the authors for
our experiments. For RetNet [56] and Linear Transformers, we use our own custom implementation."
BITS,0.8273273273273273,"For each task, we tune the models across several hyperparameters and report the results based on the
best-performing model. We use grid search to tune the models for each task. For each architecture
excluding LSTMs, we tuned across depths ∈{1, 2, 4, 6} and widths {64, 128, 256, 512}. Since
LSTMs with large depths are hard to train [43], we only consider LSTMs with depths up to 3. For
Transformers and linear Transformer variants, we tune the heads across {4, 8}. For all models, we
tune the learning rate across {0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.000001}. We primarily
use Transformers with absolute encodings for the result presented in the main paper. We train the
models for up to 250k steps unless they achieve (almost) perfect validation accuracy earlier. After
training, we evaluate the models on a fresh set of 5000 examples."
BITS,0.8288288288288288,"Note, however, that the focus of our paper is slightly different and for some problems, we are
interested in the behavior of small-sized (width or depth) models of one architecture and a relatively
larger model for another architecture. For instance, in the index lookup task, we are concerned with
how well one-layer Transformers with small widths fare against relatively larger recurrent models.
Additionally, our focus is on the comparison of different architectures of fixed sizes across lengths
and not primarily on how well models of the scale used in practice perform these tasks on much
larger lengths. Hence, we do not consider models with much larger depth or width."

steps could take between 1 hour and 16 hours depending on the length of the inputs and the size
of the models. Some runs are much shorter if the model achieves high accuracy quite early (e.g.
on lengths 20). While each individual run does not take a significant amount of time, tuning the
models, particularly for the tasks where they fail to learn requires several runs and consequently a
much longer duration. We estimate that all the runs across hyperparameters, architectures, and input
lengths took ≤1200 GPU hours in total on the GPUs mentioned above."

the depth is < 2, the sequence is either continued by choosing one of the open brackets uniformly if

character prediction which is commonly used in prior works to test models on formal languages. For

results for index lookup and Dyck-2. On a standard binary classification setup, one must make a
design choice regarding the generation of negative examples that could influence the difficulty of
the task. We first conduct experiments in the classification setup by generating negative examples
using two different strategies. On one task, we find that while recurrent models like LSTMs struggle
beyond a certain length, state-space models like DSS and Mamba are able to match Transformer’s
performance. In the second task, we find that all models are able to achieve near-perfect accuracy.
We note that both classification tasks can be solved by using shortcuts based on the way the negative
examples are created. Hence, we explore another strategy called the next character prediction setting
inspired by prior works [57, 20] on empirical analysis on formal languages. We note that the task in
that setting becomes almost identical to the copying task where a model observes a sequence and
then has to produce the same sequence. In that setting, we observe that at a small width like 64,
state-space models fail to perform the task accurately at certain lengths whereas Transformers with
the same width succeed. For models with larger widths, we find that DSS and Transformers succeed
at performing the tasks for the lengths considered in our experiments."

using some form of shortcuts. In the first case, it is straightforward to see that the first half and
the second half will differ at about half the positions on average. A recurrent algorithm does not
necessarily have to store the first N/2 elements to compute the output correctly with high probability.
Even if it stores the first few elements, then with high probability it can determine the label of
the string correctly. For the second case (Eq-one), even if it might seem difficult at first look, a
recurrent model can solve it perfectly by just maintaining a dictionary of the counts of each symbol

occurrences of at least one symbol will be different in the two halves."

of the models is 64, state-space models such as DSS and Mamba struggle to perform better than
chance-level accuracy for lengths over 400. In contrast, Transformers are able to achieve near-perfect

results indicate that even small-sized one-layer Transformers can learn a lot more efficiently than
recurrent models of much larger sizes. The experiments with bounded Dycks are primarily for
one-layer Transformers and indicate that they learn at a much slower rate than recurrent models like
LSTMs and even two-layer Transformers. On the string equality task, the difference in performance
between Transformers and recurrent models is not as stark as the Index Lookup task, particularly

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims are mentioned in the introduction and abstract reflect the
main contributions of the paper.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9219219219219219,"• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.9234234234234234,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The limitations of the work are discussed in Section 7.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.924924924924925,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.93993993993994,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results."

OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.948948948948949,"Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Our experiments are on synthetic tasks where models either achieve near-
perfect accuracy if they succeed or near chance-level accuracy if they fail. This large
quantitative difference in performance allows for clear comparison between models. As the
test sets have 5,000 entries, Binomial confidence intervals for the accuracy would be very
small and would not add further information to this comparison. Additionally, since our
primary focus is on whether any single run of an architecture can successfully solve a task,
we do not compute error bars across multiple runs and use our compute to tune the learning
rates and other hyperparameters extensively to rule out the failure of models due to lack of
sufficient tuning.

dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

in the paper do not have any direct societal impact."
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.960960960960961,Guidelines:
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9624624624624625,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not release any models or data.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9654654654654654,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.

not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
