INTRODUCTION,0.1141352063213345,"Figure 2: Left: One-to-one correspondence between decorated permutations and leveled per-

on the plane [0, 1] × [0, 1] (top left). Next, we generate random locations l1, . . . , ln from the Poisson
point process with intensity λ (middle left). Then, for each random location, we independently
assign one of the decorations {, , 6, 7} from the categorical distribution as a random mark mi
(i = 1, . . . , n) (bottom left). By reading the positional relationship of the points as a permutation
table, the resulting marked point {(li, mi) : i = 1, 2, . . . n} can be converted to a decorated permu-
tation. Furthermore, by the transformation used in Proposition 2.2 [75], the decorated permutation
can be converted to a leveled permutree, as follows. First, we draw auxiliary lines (dashed lines
colored red) below decorations , 7 and above decorations , 6. From this point on, we will stretch
the permutree edges, and it is important to emphasize that the permutree edges do not cross these
auxiliary lines. Next, focusing on the auxiliary lines extending to the bottom, we can view these as
dividing the lower region into smaller subregions (indicated by the red ovals). The edges are then
extended one by one from each subregion. As we extend the edges from the bottom to the top, when
they reach the height of each vertex, we connect the adjacent edges to that vertex (indicated by the
gray box). By doing this until all vertices are covered, we obtain a leveled permutree."

Uniform random permutation - If we restrict the decoration weights for marks to (c, c, c6, c7) =
(1, 0, 0, 0) and make the Poisson process homogeneous, the permutree process leads to a stochastic
process that generates a uniform random permutation. This relation follows immediately from the
following fact: If a collection of i.i.d. uniform random variables U1, U2, · · · ∼Uniform([0, 1]) is
ordered in ascending order, it follows a uniform random permutation. (b) Mondrian process - If
we restrict the decoration weights to (c, c, c6, c7) = (0, 0, 1, 0) and set λ(·) = µ · Leb(·), the
permutree process leads to a stochastic process that simulates a Mondrian process [88, 87] on [0, 1]
with the intensity µ and the budget 1. By viewing the vertical position in the marked point process as
the moment when the event of the cut in the Markov process (i.e., the Mondrian process) occurs, and
the horizontal position as the location where the cut occurs, the special permutation process described
above can be reduced to a Mondrian process."

locations l1, . . . , ln from the Poisson point process of the intensity λ (middle figure). Finally, for each
random location, we independently assign one of the decorations {, , 6, 7} from the uniform
categorical distribution as a random mark mi (i = 1, . . . , n) (bottom figure). The resulting marked

Transformation to random permutree - Note that the marked points generated from the marked
point process can be considered as a decorated permutation by noting its horizontal and vertical
ordering. Since decorated permutations and leveled permutrees have a one-to-one correspondence,
we are guaranteed to be able to construct their bijective transformation. First, auxiliary lines (red
dashed lines) are drawn below decorations , 7 and above decorations , 6. From this point on, we
will extend the permutree edges, but it is important to emphasize that the permutree edges do not cross
these auxiliary lines. Next, if we look at the auxiliary lines extending all the way to the bottom, we
can see that this divides the lower region into smaller sub-regions (indicated by the red oval). Then,
one edge is extended from each sub-region. The edges are extended from bottom to top, and when
the height of each vertex is reached, the edges adjacent to that vertex are connected (indicated by the
gray boxes). This is done until all vertices are covered, resulting in a leveled permutree. Finally, if
we forget about the vertical position of each vertex in the leveled permutree and focus only on its
structure as a directed tree, we obtain the corresponding permutree."

a new boulevard. The boulevard has a forward road and a backward road on both sides of it with
an entrance in between. When the new boulevard is opened up, which direction is the forward or
backward road is determined with probability 1/2. The figure shows the case where the forward road
is up. Given two concentration parameters θ1 > 0 and θ2 ≥0, the first customer to enter through
the entrance chooses the forward road with probability θ1/(θ1 + θ2), otherwise the backward road,
and receives the dish being served at the end. We assign weights θ1 and θ2 to the forward and back
roads, respectively. At this stage, the one that the customers did not choose between the forward and
backward roads (the lower backward road, represented by the dashed line in the figure) has not yet
been activated. Until both the forward and backward roads are activated, the entrance itself serves as
another endpoint of this boulevard. (b): The next customer coming to this boulevard, entering through
the entrance to this boulevard, will proceed to the side street on that side in the proportion according
to the weights assigned to each side. This side street itself corresponds to the boulevard in the next
smaller CRS in the recursive structure. That is, the forward direction of this side street (i.e., whether
it extends to the left or right first in the figure) is determined by this customer with probability 1/2.
The concept of whether the forward or backward road is chosen first on each side street determines
whether the vertex corresponding to this side street in the permutree structure extends initially to the
parent side or to the child side. (c): Given a discount parameter α ≥0, this side street is assigned a
weight of 1 −α, which is the number of customers who have taken the side street minus the discount
parameter α. The edge divided by the side street is assigned a weight of the discount parameter α.
(d)-(e): When the next customer decides where to go based on the ratio of weights assigned to edges
and side streets, she/he may choose an inactive road (dashed line in (c)). In that case, after the new
side street is added (which also releases the entrance termination facility), the backstreet beyond
it (dashed line in (d)) will continue to remain inactive. (f)-(g): The above procedures are repeated
