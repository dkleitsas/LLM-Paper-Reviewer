ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.002331002331002331,"Modern Neural Architecture Search (NAS) focuses on ﬁnding the best perform-
ing architectures in hardware-aware settings; e.g., those with an optimal tradeoff
of accuracy and latency. Due to many advantages of prediction models over live
measurements, the search process is often guided by estimates of how well each
considered network architecture performs on the desired metrics. Typical predic-
tion models range from operation-wise lookup tables over gradient-boosted trees
and neural networks, with little known information on how they compare. We
evaluate 18 different performance predictors on ten combinations of metrics, de-
vices, network types, and training tasks, and ﬁnd that MLP models are the most
promising. We then simulate and evaluate how the guidance of such prediction
models affects the subsequent architecture selection. Due to inaccurate predic-
tions, the selected architectures are generally suboptimal, which we quantify as
an expected reduction in accuracy and hypervolume. We show that simply ver-
ifying the predictions of just the selected architectures can lead to substantially
improved results. Under a time budget, we ﬁnd it preferable to use a fast and
inaccurate prediction model over accurate but slow live measurements."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.006993006993006993,"Modern neural network architectures are designed not only considering their primary objective,
such as accuracy. While existing architectures can be scaled down to work with the limited available
memory and computational power of, e.g., mobile phones, they are signiﬁcantly outperformed by
speciﬁcally designed architectures (Howard et al., 2017; Sandler et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018;
Ma et al., 2018). Standard hardware metrics include memory usage, number of model parameters,
Multiply-Accumulate operations, energy consumption, latency, and more; each of which may be
limited by the hardware platform or network task. As the range of tasks and target platforms grows,
specialized architectures and the methods to ﬁnd them efﬁciently are gaining importance."
INTRODUCTION,0.009324009324009324,"The automated design and discovery of specialized architectures is the main intent of Neural Archi-
tecture Search (NAS). This recent ﬁeld of study repeatedly broke state of the art records (Zoph et al.,
2018; Real et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019; Tan & Le, 2019; Chu et al., 2019a; Hu et al., 2020) while
aiming to reduce the researchers’ involvement with this tedious and time-consuming process to a
minimum. As the performance of each considered architecture needs to be evaluated, the hardware
metrics need to be either measured live or guessed by a trained prediction model. While measur-
ing live has the advantage of not suffering from inaccurate predictions, the corresponding hardware
needs to be available during the search process. Measuring on-demand may also signiﬁcantly slow
down the search process and necessitates further measurements for each new architecture search.
On the other hand, a prediction model abstracts the hardware from the search code and simpliﬁes
changes to the optimization targets, such as metrics or devices. The data set to train the predictor
also has to be collected only once so that a trained predictor then works in the absence of the hard-
ware it is predicting for, e.g., in a cloud environment. Furthermore, a differentiable predictor can be
used for gradient-based architecture optimization of typically non-differentiable metrics (Cai et al.,
2019; Xu et al., 2020; Nayman et al., 2021)."

et al. (2020); Wu et al. (2019); Wan et al. (2020); Dai et al. (2020); Nayman et al. (2021)), there

INTRODUCTION,0.016317016317016316,"what happens when a predictor is inaccurate. This work investigates the above points. As a ﬁrst
contribution, we conduct large-scale experiments on ten hardware-metric datasets chosen from HW-
NAS-Bench (Li et al., 2021a) and TransNAS-Bench-101 (Duan et al., 2021). We explore how
powerful the different predictors are when using different amounts of training data and whether
these results generalize across different network architecture types. As a second contribution, we
extensively simulate the subsequent architecture selection to investigate the impact of inaccurate
predictors. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of network-based prediction models; provide
insights into predictor mistakes and what to expect from them. To facilitate reproducibility and
further research, our experimental results and code are made available in Appendix A."

RELATED WORK,0.02097902097902098,"NAS Benchmarks:
As the search spaces of NAS methods often differ from one another and lack
extensive studies, the difﬁculty of fair comparisons and reproducibility have become a major concern
(Yang et al., 2019; Li & Talwalkar, 2020). To alleviate this problem, researchers have exhaustively
evaluated search spaces of several thousand architectures to create benchmarks (Ying et al., 2019;
Dong & Yang, 2020; Dong et al., 2020; Siems et al., 2020), containing detailed statistics for each
architecture. TransNAS-Bench-101 (Duan et al., 2021) evaluates several thousand architectures
across seven diverse tasks and ﬁnds that the best task-speciﬁc architectures may vary signiﬁcantly."
RELATED WORK,0.023310023310023312,"The popular NAS-BENCH 201 benchmark (Dong & Yang, 2020) has been further extended with ten
different hardware metrics for all 15625 architectures on each of the three data sets CIFAR10, CI-
FAR100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) and ImageNet16-120 (Chrabaszcz et al., 2017). Major ﬁndings of
this HW-NAS Bench (Li et al., 2021a) include that FLOPs and the number of parameters are a poor
approximation for other metrics such as latency. Many existing NAS methods use such inadequate
substitutes for their simplicity and would beneﬁt from their replacement with better prediction mod-
els. Li et al. also ﬁnd that hardware-speciﬁc costs do not correlate well across hardware platforms.
While accounting for each device’s characteristics improves the NAS results, it is also expensive.
Predictors can reduce costs by requiring fewer measurements and shorter query times. 1."
RELATED WORK,0.02564102564102564,"Predictors in NAS:
Aside from real-time measurements (Tan et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2018),
hardware metric estimation in NAS is commonly performed via Lookup Table (Wu et al., 2019),
Analytical Estimation or a Prediction Model (Dai et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). While an operation-
and layer-wise Lookup Table can accurately estimate hardware-agnostic metrics, such as FLOPs or
the number of parameters (Cai et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2019a), they may be subop-
timal for device-dependent metrics. Latency and energy consumption have non-obvious factors that
depend on hardware speciﬁcs such as memory, cache usage, the ability to parallelize each operation,
and an interplay between different network operations. Such details can be captured with neural
networks (Dai et al., 2020; Mendoza & Wang, 2020; Ponomarev et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) or
other specialized models (Yao et al., 2018; Wess et al., 2021)."
RELATED WORK,0.027972027972027972,"Of particular interest is the correct prediction of the model loss or accuracy, possibly reducing the
architecture search time by orders of magnitude (Mellor et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Li et al.,
2021b). In addition to common predictors such as Linear Regression, Random Forests (Liaw et al.,
2002) or Gaussian Processes (Rasmussen, 2003); specialized techniques may exploit training curve
extrapolation, network weight sharing or gradient information. Our experiments follow the recent
large-scale study of White et al. (2021), who compare 31 diverse accuracy prediction methods based
on initialization and query time, using three NAS benchmarks."

PREDICTING HARDWARE METRICS,0.039627039627039624,"Differences to accuracy predictors:
There are fundamental differences when predicting hard-
ware metrics and the accuracy of network topologies. The most essential is the cost to obtain a
helpful predictor, which may vary widely for accuracy prediction methods. While determining the
test accuracy requires the costly and lengthy training of networks, measuring hardware metrics does
not necessitate any network training. Consequentially, specialized accuracy-estimation methods that
rely on trained networks, loss history, learning curve extrapolation, or early stopping do not apply to
hardware metrics. Furthermore, so-called zero-cost proxies that predict metrics from the gradients
of a single batch are dependant on the network topology but not on the hardware the network is
placed on. Therefore, the dominant hardware-metric predictor family is model-based."
PREDICTING HARDWARE METRICS,0.04195804195804196,"Since all relevant predictors are model-based, they can be compared by their training set size. This
simpliﬁes the initialization time of a predictor as the number of prior measured architectures on
which they are trained. In stark contrast, some accuracy predictors do not need any training data,
while others require several partially or fully trained networks. Since an untrained network and a
few batches sufﬁce to measure a hardware-metric, the collection of such a training set is comparably
inexpensive."
PREDICTING HARDWARE METRICS,0.04428904428904429,"Additionally, hardware predictors are generally used supplementary to a one-shot network optimized
for loss or accuracy. Depending on the NAS method, a fully differentiable predictor is required in
order to guide the gradient-based architecture selection. Typical choices are Lookup Tables (Cai
et al., 2019; Nayman et al., 2021) and neural networks (Xu et al., 2020)."
PREDICTING HARDWARE METRICS,0.046620046620046623,"Model-based predictors:
The goal of a predictor fp(a) is to accurately approximate the function
f(a), which may be, e.g., the latency of an architecture a from the search space A. A model-based
predictor is trained via supervised learning on a set Dtrain of datapoints (a, f(a)), after which it can
be inexpensively queried for estimates on further architectures. The collection of the dataset and the
duration of the training are referred to as initialization time and training time respectively."
PREDICTING HARDWARE METRICS,0.04895104895104895,"The quality of such a trained predictor is generally determined by the (ranking) correlation between
measurements {f(a)|a ∈Atest} and predictions {fp(a)|a ∈Atest} on the unseen architectures
Atest ⊂A. Common correlation metric choices are Pearson (PCC), Spearman (SCC) and Kendall’s
Tau (KT) (Chu et al., 2019b; Yu et al., 2020; Siems et al., 2020)."

The default hyperparameters of the used predictors vary signiﬁcantly
in their levels of hyper-parameter tuning, especially in the context of NAS. Additionally, some pre-
dictors may internally make use of cross-validation, while others do not. Following White et al.
(2021), we attempt to level the playing ﬁeld by running a cross-validation random-search over hyper-
parameters each time a predictor is ﬁt to data. Each search is limited to 5000 iterations and a total
run time of 15 minutes and naturally excludes any test data. The predictor-speciﬁc parameter details

may modify the image size and channels in four ways: not at all, double the channel count, halve the
spatial size, and both. Every network has to double the channel count 1 to 3 times, resulting in 3,256

most of the predictors, although e.g. Gaussian Processes and BOHAMIANN saturate early. The
simple Linear Regression and Ridge Regression models also fail to make proper use of hundreds
of data points but perform decently when only a few training samples are available. Interestingly,
the same is true for the graph-encoding network-based predictors BONAS and GCN. While know-
ing how the different paths within each cell connect (see Appendix B) is especially useful given
less than ﬁfty training samples, the advantage disappears afterward. In contrast, the graph-encoding

able for Lookup Tables, achieving an almost perfect ranking correlation is possible. Nonetheless,
Linear Regression requires only 124 training samples to compete even there and is signiﬁcantly bet-

process will select the architectures with the best tradeoff of accuracy and the hardware metric, i.e.,

dictions are obtained by drawing random values from this deviation distribution and adding them to
the ground-truth hardware measurements."

In other words, the average selected architecture has 1.06% lower accuracy than a comparable one
on the true Paret front. However, simply verifying the hardware metric predictions through actual
measurements reveals that some selected architectures are suboptimal. By choosing only the Pareto
subset of the selection, the opportunity loss can be reduced to 0.43% (MRApareto)."

EVALUATING THE PREDICTOR-GUIDED ARCHITECTURE SELECTION,0.2517482517482518,"Verifying the predicted results matters (Figure 4, left). The best prediction models achieve a KT

means, for each selected architecture, there exists an architecture of equal or lower latency in the
true Pareto set (if latency is the hardware metric) that improves the average accuracy by 1.5%. Even
though all selected architectures are believed to form a Pareto set, that is not the case. Their optimal
subset has a reduction of only MRApareto ≈0.5%, a signiﬁcant improvement. However, ﬁnding
this optimal subset requires actually measuring the hardware metrics of the architectures selected by
the used NAS method."
EVALUATING THE PREDICTOR-GUIDED ARCHITECTURE SELECTION,0.2540792540792541,"Furthermore, the left of Figure 4 aids in anticipating the MRA given a speciﬁc predictor. If one used
e.g. BOHAMIANN (KT≈0.8, see Figure1a) instead of MLPs or LGBoost (KT≈0.9), MRApareto
increases from around 0.5% to roughly 1.2%. The average accuracy of the selected architectures is
thus reduced by another 0.7%, just by using an unsuitable hardware metric predictor. Lookup Tables
(KT≈0.45) are not even visualized anymore, they have an MRApareto of over 2.5%."
EVALUATING THE PREDICTOR-GUIDED ARCHITECTURE SELECTION,0.2564102564102564,"Another interesting observation is that the gap between MRAall and MRApareto is wider for better

EVALUATING THE PREDICTOR-GUIDED ARCHITECTURE SELECTION,0.25874125874125875,"The dataset and metric matter (Figure 4, center). While we generally present the results averaged
over datasets, there exists some discrepancy among them. Most interestingly, predicting hardware
metrics on harder classiﬁcation problems (ImageNet16-120 is harder than CIFAR10) also results in
a higher MRA. This is especially important since MRA is an absolute accuracy reduction. Even
though the CIFAR10 networks achieve twice the accuracy of ImageNet16-120 networks, they lose
less absolute accuracy to imperfect predictions. The order of MRA/dataset is primarily stable for
any predictor KT correlation. Finally, as visualized by the shaded areas, the standard deviation
of the MRA is generally huge. Consequentially, predictor-guided NAS is very likely to produce
results of varying quality for each different predictor or search attempt, especially with less accurate
predictors."
EVALUATING THE PREDICTOR-GUIDED ARCHITECTURE SELECTION,0.26107226107226106,"The number of considered architectures matters (Figure 4, right). We measure the hypervolume of
the discovered Pareto front (i.e., the area beneath it, see Appendix H), which, unlike MRA, also
considers the hardware metric. Quite obviously, if the architectures from the true Pareto set are not
considered, they can not be selected. To achieve the highest possible hypervolume of around 4.2
(i.e. ﬁnd the true Pareto set), every architecture in the search space must be evaluated with a perfect
predictor. This is impossible in most real-world cases, where only a tiny fraction of all possible
architectures can ever be considered."
EVALUATING THE PREDICTOR-GUIDED ARCHITECTURE SELECTION,0.2634032634032634,"For HW-NAS-Bench, considering 5000 architectures with perfect live measurements and predicting
the metrics for all 15625 with ranking correlation KT≈0.73 results in selecting equivalent sets of
architectures. As seen in Figure1a, Ridge Regression can achieve this performance with fewer
than 100 training samples. Thus, a worse predictor leads to better results if it enables considering
more architectures. This insight is especially crucial for live measurements, which are accurate but
slow. Similarly, estimating the network accuracy with super-networks takes much more time than
predicting their performance with a neural predictor (Wen et al., 2020). If the measurement of any
metrics is the limiting factor, a guided selection of a cheap predictor is likely to do better."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.2703962703962704,"Chosen prediction methods
Given the nature of hardware-metric prediction, only the subset of
model-based predictors evaluated by White et al. (2021) is suitable. We extended this subset with
four models, including the popular Lookup Table. We abstained from evaluating layer-wise pre-
dictors (e.g. Wess et al. (2021)) since such data is not available, and meta-learning predictors (Lee
et al., 2021) due to the vast possibilities to conﬁgure them. A separate and specialized comparison
between classic and meta-learning predictors seems favorable to us."
DISCUSSION,0.2727272727272727,"Simulation limitations
In contrast to evaluating real predictors, the simulation allows us to
quickly make statements for any test set sizes and predictor-inaccuracies. However, naturally, the
results are only approximations. While they match actual values, they are generally slightly pes-
simistic (see Appendix I). We also limit the simulation to HW-NAS-Bench since the changes to
classiﬁcation results are more accessible to interpretation than changes to loss values across dif-
ferent problem types. Finally, the current simulation approach can not investigate methods that
absolutely require a trained one-shot network, such as gradient-based approaches. Including such
methods is an interesting direction for future research."
DISCUSSION,0.27505827505827507,"Transferability of the results
Our evaluation includes ﬁve challenging and diverse datasets
based on the micro-level search space of HW-NAS-Bench and ﬁve latency-based datasets of var-
ious macro-level search space architectures in TransNAS-Bench-101. Nonetheless, we ﬁnd shared
trends: All tested prediction models improve over Lookup Tables with little amounts of training
data. Furthermore, most predictors beneﬁt from more training data, even until the entire search
space (aside from the test set) is known. We also ﬁnd that network-based predictors are generally
best but may be challenged by tree-based predictors if enough training data is available. Given only
a few samples, Ridge Regression performs better than most other models."
DISCUSSION,0.2773892773892774,"Recommendations
While Lookup Tables are a cheap, simple, and popular model in gradient-
based architecture selection, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant variance in performance across tasks and devices
(see Table 1 and Appendix E). We recommend replacing such models with either MLPs or Ridge
Regression, which are more stable, fully differentiable, and often take less than 100 training samples
to achieve better results."
DISCUSSION,0.27972027972027974,"For most realistic scenarios where more than 100 training samples are available, MLP models are
the most promising. They are among the top predictors on HW-NAS-Bench and demonstrate out-
standing performance on the TransNAS-Bench-101 datasets. We found that specialized architecture
encodings are primarily beneﬁcial for little training data but suspect that they enjoy an additional
advantage when network topologies are more complex and diverse (White et al., 2021)."
DISCUSSION,0.28205128205128205,"While the query time for all predictors is less than 0.05s and thus negligible, there is a notable
difference in training time (see Appendix F), primarily due to the hyper-parameter optimization. We
recommend Ridge Regression for very little amounts of training data and LGBoost otherwise if that
is an important factor."
DISCUSSION,0.28438228438228436,"If a NAS method selects architectures based on hardware metric predictions, we strongly suggest
verifying the results by measuring the true metric value afterward. Doing so may eliminate inferior
candidates and improve the average result substantially. Finally, if the limiting factor to a NAS
method is the slow measurement of hardware metrics, using a much faster predictor may lead to an
improvement, even if the prediction model is less accurate."

CONCLUSIONS"
CONCLUSIONS,0.289044289044289,"This work evaluated various hardware-metric prediction models on ten problems of different met-
rics, devices, and network architecture types. We then simulated the selection process for different
test set sizes and predictor inaccuracies to improve our understanding of predictor-based architec-
ture selection. We ﬁnd that even imperfect predictors may improve NAS if their low query time
enables considering more candidate architectures. Finally, verifying the predictions for the selected
candidates can lead to a drastic improvement of their average performance. The code and results are
made available, thus acting both for recommendation and as a baseline for future works."

Pareto set, it is possible for the Mean Reduction of Accuracy of the Pareto subset (MRApareto) to be
worse than the average over all architectures (MRAall). This naturally happens more frequently for
worse predictors with a high sampling std. and low KT correlation. Consequentially, the difference
between MRAall and MRApareto is wider for better predictors (see Figure 4). Additionally, all of
the selected non-Pareto-front members are clustered in a high-latency area and redundant with each
other. This emphasizes the limitations of just considering drops in accuracy, as the hardware metric
aspect is ignored. In this case, the predictor-guided selection failed to ﬁnd a low-latency solution.
In this regard, hypervolume is a better but less intuitive metric."

Left: The distance of each selected candidate architecture C1 to the true Pareto front is measured,
for accuracy and the hardware metric. C1 is dominated by A2, A3, and A4 of the true Pareto set. A2
has a slightly higher accuracy than C1 while being much better on the hardware metric, e.g. latency.
A4 has a slightly better hardware metric value, but much higher accuracy. Given several candidate
architectures, their differences are averaged.
Right: We compute the reference point for the hypervolume (for two objectives: area under a
Pareto front) by multiplying the highest hardware metric value from the true Pareto front with 1.1,
and accuracy 0. While we are consistent throughout all experiments, this choice is arbitrary, as there
is no obviously correct choice for the reference point. If the hypervolume of a supposed Pareto
front is computed, the reference point of the true Pareto front is reused. Thus, choosing inferior
architectures will always reduce the hypervolume. We arbitrarily chose the multiplier of m = 1.1
as a middle ground between making the rightmost point of the Pareto front irrelevant (m = 1.0) and
overemphasizing it (m >> 1.0)."
