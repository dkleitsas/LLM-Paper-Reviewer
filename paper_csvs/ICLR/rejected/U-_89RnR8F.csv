ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0030581039755351682,"Understanding and explaining the mistakes made by trained models is critical
to many machine learning objectives, such as improving robustness, addressing
concept drift, and mitigating biases. However, this is often an ad hoc process
that involves manually looking at the model’s mistakes on many test samples and
guessing at the underlying reasons for those incorrect predictions. In this paper, we
propose a systematic approach, conceptual counterfactual explanations (CCE), that
explains why a classiﬁer makes a mistake on a particular test sample(s) in terms of
human-understandable concepts (e.g. this zebra is misclassiﬁed as a dog because
of faint stripes). We base CCE on two prior ideas: counterfactual explanations and
concept activation vectors, and validate our approach on well-known pretrained
models, showing that it explains the models’ mistakes meaningfully. In addition, for
new models trained on data with spurious correlations, CCE accurately identiﬁes
the spurious correlation as the cause of model mistakes from a single misclassiﬁed
test sample. On two challenging medical applications, CCE generated useful
insights, conﬁrmed by clinicians, into biases and mistakes the model makes in
real-world settings. The code for CCE is publicly available and can easily be
applied to explain mistakes in new models."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.009174311926605505,"People who use machine learning (ML) models often need to understand why a trained model
is making a particular mistake. For example, upon seeing a model misclassify an image, an ML
practitioner may ask questions such as: Was this kind of image underrepresented in my training
distribution? Am I preprocessing the image correctly? Has my model learned a spurious correlation
or bias that is hindering generalization? Answering this question correctly affects the usability of a
model and can help make the model more robust. Consider a motivating example:"
INTRODUCTION,0.012232415902140673,"Example 1: Usability of a Pretrained Model. A pathologist downloads a pretrained model to
classify histopathology images. Despite a high reported accuracy, he ﬁnds the model performing
poorly on his images. He investigates why that is the case, ﬁnding that the hues in his images are
different than in the original training data. Realizing the issue, he is able to transform his own images
with some preprocessing, matching the training distribution and improving the model’s performance."
INTRODUCTION,0.01529051987767584,"In the above example, we have a domain shift occurring between training and test time, which
degrades the model’s performance (Subbaswamy et al., 2019; Koh et al., 2020). By explaining the
cause of the domain shift, we are able to easily ﬁx the model’s predictions. On the other hand, if the
domain shift is due to more complex spurious correlations the model has learned, it might need to
be completely retrained before it can be used. During development, identifying and explaining a
model’s failure points can also make it more robust (Abid et al., 2019; Kiela et al., 2021), as in the
following example:"
INTRODUCTION,0.01834862385321101,"Example 2: Discovering Biases During Development. A dermatologist trains a machine learning
classiﬁer to classify skin diseases from skin images collected from patients at her hospital. She shares
her trained model with a colleague at a different hospital, who reports that the model makes many
mistakes with his own patients. She investigates why the model is making mistakes, realizing that
patients at her colleague’s hospital have different skin colors and ages. Answering this question
allows her to not only know her own model’s biases but also guides her to expand her training set
with the right kind of data to build a more robust model."

INTRODUCTION,0.024464831804281346,"Explaining a model’s mistakes is also useful in other settings where data distributions may change,
such as concept drift for deployed machine learning models (Lu et al., 2018). Despite its usefulness,
explaining a model’s performance drop is often an ad hoc process that involves manually looking at
the model’s mistakes on many test samples and guessing at the underlying reasons for those incorrect
predictions. We present counterfactual conceptual explanations (CCE), a systematic method for
explaining model mistakes in terms of meaningful human-understandable concepts, such as those in
the examples above (e.g. hues). In addition, CCE was developed with the following criteria:"
INTRODUCTION,0.027522935779816515,"• No training data or retraining: CCE does not require access to the training data or model
retraining.
• Only needs the model: CCE only needs white-box access to the model. The user can use
any dataset to learn desired concepts.
• High-level explanations: CCE provides high-level explanations of model mistakes using
concepts that are easy for users to understand."

the ﬁrst step is to deﬁne a concept library. After deﬁning a concept library, we then learn a concept

as the Zebra image shown here as an African hunting dog, we would like to generate a conceptual
counterfactual. Meaning that we would like to generate a perturbation in the embedding space that
would correct the model prediction, using a weighted sum of our concept bank. (c) Our method
assigns a score to the set of concepts. A large positive score means that adding that concept to the

RELATED WORKS,0.0764525993883792,"Counterfactual Explanations
Counterfactual explanations (Verma et al. (2020) provides a com-
prehensive review) are a class of model interpretation methods that seek to answer: what perturbations
to the input are needed for a model’s prediction to change in a particular way? A large number
of counterfactual explanation methods have been proposed with various desiderata such as sparse
perturbations (Wachter et al., 2017), perturbations that remain close to the data manifold (Dhurandhar"

provide an interpretable link between model predictions and perturbations to input features. There
are several works focusing on counterfactual explanations for image data(Goyal et al., 2019; Singla
et al., 2020) and many of these methods use distractor images or modify input images to explain the
model behavior. However, perturbations or saliency maps in the input space are shown to be tricky to
interpret and be adopted by users(Alqaraawi et al., 2020; Adebayo et al., 2018)."
RELATED WORKS,0.0856269113149847,"To compute CCE, we use a similar approach, perturbing input data to change its predictions, but for
a complementary goal: to understand the limitations and biases of our model and its training data,
rather than to change a speciﬁc prediction. Further improving upon existing work, we do this by
directly using human-interpretable concepts, without having access to training data."
RELATED WORKS,0.08868501529051988,"Concept Activation Vectors
To explain an image classiﬁcation model’s mistakes in a useful way,
we need to operate not with low-level features, but with more meaningful concepts. Concept activation
vectors (CAVs) (Kim et al., 2018) are a powerful method to understand the internals of a network
in human-interpretable concepts. CAVs are linear classiﬁers trained in the bottleneck layers of a
network and correspond to concepts that are usually user-deﬁned or automatically discovered from
data (Ghorbani et al., 2019). Unlike many prior interpretation methods, explanations produced
by CAVs are in terms of high-level, human-understandable concepts rather than individual pixels
(Simonyan et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2016) or training samples (Koh & Liang, 2017)."
RELATED WORKS,0.09174311926605505,"In previous literature, CAVs have been used to test the association between a concept and the model’s
prediction on a class of training data (Kim et al., 2018) as well as provide visual explanations for
predictions (Zhou et al., 2018). Our approach extends CAVs by showing that perturbations along
the CAV can be used to change a model’s prediction on a speciﬁc test sample, e.g. to correct a
mistaken prediction, and thereby be used in a similar manner to counterfactuals. Since samples (even
of the same class) can be misclassiﬁed for different reasons (see Fig. 6), our approach allows a more
contextual understanding of a model’s behavior and mistakes."
RELATED WORKS,0.09480122324159021,"Bias/Error Detection and Robustness
Understanding a model’s behavior and explaining its mis-
takes is critical for building more robust and less biased models, as we have discussed in Section 1.
While some other methods, such as FairML (Adebayo & Kagal, 2016) and the What-If Tool (Wexler
et al., 2020), can also be used to discover biases and failure points in models, they are typically limited
to tabular datasets where sensitive features are explicitly designated, unlike our approach which is
designed for unstructured data and works with a more ﬂexible and diverse set of concepts. In a similar
spirit to our work, Singh et al. (2020) aim to identify and mitigate contextual bias, however, they
assume access to the whole training setup and data; which is a limiting factor in practical scenarios."
RELATED WORKS,0.09785932721712538,"Our approach can also be used to explain a model’s performance degradation with data drift. It is
complementary to methods for out-of-distribution sample detection (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016)
and black-box shift detection (Lipton et al., 2018), which can detect data drift, but cannot explain
the underlying reasons. There are also algorithmic approaches to improve model robustness with
data drift (Raghunathan et al., 2018; Nestor et al., 2019). Although these methods can provide some
guarantees around robustness for unstructured data, they are in terms of low-level perturbations and
do not hold with more conceptual and natural changes in data distributions. There are several recent
methods for detecting clusters of mistakes made by a model (Kim et al., 2019; d’Eon et al., 2021),
which is useful for detecting disparity in the model, for example. CCE differs in that instead of
ﬁnding mistake clusters, CCE explains errors from just one (or a few) image."

LEARNING CONCEPTS"
LEARNING CONCEPTS,0.11314984709480122,"In generating conceptual explanations, the ﬁrst step is to deﬁne a concept library: a set of human-
interpretable concepts C = {c1, c2, ...} that occur in the dataset. For each concept, we collect positive
examples, Pci, that exhibit the concept, as well as negative examples, Nci, in which the concept is
absent. Unless otherwise stated, we use Pci = Nci = 100. These concepts can be deﬁned by the
researcher, by non-ML domain experts, or even learned automatically from the data (Ghorbani et al.,
2019). Since concepts are broadly reusable within a data domain, they can also be shared among
researchers. For our experiments with natural images, we deﬁned 170 general concepts that include
(a) the presence of speciﬁc objects (e.g. mirror, person), (b) settings (e.g. street, snow) (c) textures
(e.g. stripes, metal), and (d) image qualities (e.g. blurriness, greenness). Many of our concepts were
adapted from the BRODEN dataset of visual concepts (Fong & Vedaldi, 2018). Note that the data
used to learn concepts can differ from the data used to train the ML model that we evaluate."
LEARNING CONCEPTS,0.1162079510703364,"After deﬁning a concept library, we then learn an SVM and the corresponding CAV for each concept.
We follow the same procedure as in (Kim et al., 2018), for the penultimate layer of a ResNet18
pretrained in ImageNet. This step only needs to be done once for each model that we want to evaluate,
and the CAVs can then be used to explain any number of misclassiﬁed samples. We refer the reader
to Appendix A.1 for implementational details and Appendix B for a full list of concepts. We denote
the vector normal to the classiﬁcation hyperplane boundary as ci(normalized, i.e. |ci| = 1) and
the intercept of the SVM as φi. To measure whether concepts are successfully learned, we keep a
hold-out validation set and measure the validation accuracy, disregarding concepts with accuracies
below a threshold (0.7 in our experiments, which left us with 168 of the 170 concepts). We provide
more details about the threshold in Appendix B."

CONCEPTUAL COUNTERFACTUAL EXPLANATIONS,0.12232415902140673,"Drawing inspiration from the counterfactual explanations literature (Verma et al., 2020), we generate
a perturbation for a given misclassiﬁed test sample by varying the amount of different concepts in a
way such that the perturbation satisﬁes the following principles:"
CONCEPTUAL COUNTERFACTUAL EXPLANATIONS,0.12538226299694188,"1. Correctness: A counterfactual is considered correct if it achieves a desired outcome. In our
case, this would mean that the perturbed test point should be classiﬁed as the correct label.
2. Validity: We would like our counterfactuals to be valid, such that they would not violate
real-world conditions. In our case, this means ensuring that the perturbed points contain
realistic levels of each concept, as discussed below.
3. Sparsity: The ultimate goal of generating explanations is communicating them to users. An-
alyzing a large number of modiﬁcations and interactions may not be trivial, so perturbations
should change a small number of concepts."
CONCEPTUAL COUNTERFACTUAL EXPLANATIONS,0.12844036697247707,"Let LCE denote the cross entropy loss. Using the concept vectors and intercepts (ci, φi)(see 3.1),
we build our concept bank C ∈RNc×m, φ ∈RNc where Nc is the number of concepts and
m is the output dimension of the bottleneck layer. As our goal is to come up with a scoring
scheme for concepts, we need to deﬁne what it means to add a concept. For this purpose, we use
statistics of training samples. We compute the geometric margin to the decision boundary of the
SVM, di = cibL(xi)T + φi, for all of the training examples. As different concepts have different
embedding volumes, we scale each concept by the maximum amount of the concept observed in the
data used to learn that concept. Let dmax

this fact by looking at the prediction of our concept SVM. If the concept already exists in the image,

CCE REVEALS SPURIOUS CORRELATIONS LEARNED BY THE MODEL,0.26299694189602446,"We start by demonstrating that CCE correctly identiﬁes high-level spurious correlations that models
may have learned. For example, consider a training dataset that consists of images of different animals
in natural settings. A model trained on such a dataset may capture not only the desired correlations
related to the class of animals but spurious correlations related to other objects present in the images
and the setting of the images. We use CCE to identify these spurious correlations."
CCE REVEALS SPURIOUS CORRELATIONS LEARNED BY THE MODEL,0.26605504587155965,"To systematically validate CCE, we need to know the ground-truth spurious correlations that a model
has learned. To this end, we train models with intentional and known spurious correlations using the
MetaDataset (Liang & Zou, 2021), a collection of labeled datasets of animals in different settings
and with different objects. We construct 20 different training scenarios, each consisting of 5 animal
classes (cat, dog, bear, bird, elephant). We trained a separate model for each scenario. In each
scenario, one class is only included with a speciﬁc confounding variable (e.g. all images of dogs
are with snow), inducing a spurious correlation in the model (images of dogs without snow will be
misclassiﬁed), which we can probe with CCE. We also train a control model using random samples
of animals across contexts, without intentional spurious correlations. In Appendix A.7.2, we provide
training distributions with less severe spurious correlations, i.e. where instead of all images having
the confounding concept, we use a varying level of severity in the correlations."

as one of the top 3 concepts (Fig. 2(b)). For example, in the model we trained with dogs confounded
with snow, CCE recovered the spurious correlation in 100% of test samples. We compare these results
to performing CCE using the control model, in which the same test images are presented, as well as
to picking concepts randomly, both of which result in the spurious correlation being identiﬁed much
less frequently. We provide results in Appendix A.7.3, where instead of doing a sample-by-sample

use two concepts. For instance, we use 50 dog images with water and 50 with bed during training. In
Figure 3a, we show such a scenario. In all of these images, CCE(Univariate) identiﬁes both bed and
water concepts to explain the model mistakes. However, in the ﬁrst image, there is already water and

explanation. However, when CCE with validity constraints is used, the score for the water concept
in the ﬁrst image and the bed concept in the second image drops. Ultimately, this would result in a

too much skin hair in the image contributed to the model’s mistake. This is consistent with other
studies which show that presence of skin hair can degrade the model performance (Okur & Turkan,
2018). In all cases, CCE identiﬁes relevant concepts from our expanded concept bank and displays
them to the user. These explanations were validated by a trained dermatologist as plausible reasons
why these images may have been difﬁcult to classify. In Appendix A.4, we describe details of this

EVALUATING CCE IN THE WILD,0.4434250764525994,"Cardiology - Pneumothorax Classiﬁcation from Chest X-Ray Images
Several studies have
raised concerns about the biases learned by chest X-ray diagnosis models and their deployability in
novel domains (Seyyed-Kalantari et al., 2020; Larrazabal et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021). We investigate
a cross-site evaluation setting, where models trained on Chest X-Ray images are used to classify the
pneumothorax condition. Speciﬁcally, we are taking a binary classiﬁcation model trained on a dataset
collected from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda (NIH)(Wang et al., 2017)
and we test the model with images obtained from the Stanford Health Care in Palo Alto (SHC)(Irvin
et al., 2019). In this experiment, we follow the protocol described in (Wu et al., 2021); see Section
A.5 for details. Notably, the NIH dataset consists of images from the frontal (AP/PA) view positions,
whereas in the SHC dataset, there are also images obtained from the Lateral View. This would mean
that the model has not seen any images from the lateral view during training. Several examples of
these images can be seen in Appendix Figure 10. Similar to Sec.4.4, we use 100 pairs of chest X-ray
images to learn clinically relevant concepts: Lateral View & AP View(view positions), Cardiomegaly
& Atelectasis(comorbidities), patient gender, and patient age under 24."
EVALUATING CCE IN THE WILD,0.44648318042813456,"From the SHC dataset, we randomly select 150 images taken from the lateral view where the model
makes a mistake. We run CCE using a concept bank with 120 BRODEN concepts, in addition to our
clinically relevant concepts. In 100% of these 150 test images, the Lateral View concept received the
largest negative score, meaning that CCE ﬁnds removing the concept would increase the probability
of correctly classifying these images. This is consistent with cardiologist expectation: a model that
has not seen images from the lateral view may fail to generalize to that category. With the help of
CCE, end-users can identify these shortcomings and help address the biases in the training dataset."

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.4525993883792049,"We present a simple and intuitive method, CCE, that generates meaningful insights into why machine
learning models make mistakes on test samples. We validated that CCE identiﬁes spurious correlations
learned by the model for both natural images and medical images, where CCE’s explanations are
conﬁrmed by clinicians. In medical applications, CCE was able to inform the end-user about the
image quality conditions and identify biases in the model’s training data. CCE is fast: the concept
bank just needs to be learned once using simple SVMs and each test example takes < 0.3 seconds
on a single CPU. It can be readily applied to any deep network without retraining and provides
explanations of mistakes in human-interpretable terms."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.45565749235474007,"CCE can detect biases in training data that lead to model mistakes without needing the training data.
It requires a small number of labeled examples to learn concepts. For instance, the dermatology
experiments used 50 images to learn each concept. The data used to learn concepts can come from
datasets different from the ones used to train the model. In the dermatology case study, we learned
concepts using the ISIC dataset (for skin hair) and still correctly explained the mistakes of a model
trained on the Fitzpatrick17k data. This makes the CCE method more broadly useful. The quality
of the concept bank is a crucial component for the outcome of the explanations, as demonstrated in
AppendixA.7.1. It is important to seek guidance from the experts of the problems when building
concept libraries to obtain the best results. Incorporating automatic concept learning(Ghorbani et al.,
2019) is a fruitful future direction, as it could further simplify the entire pipeline."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.45871559633027525,"There are several promising areas where CCE can be extended. While we focused in this paper on
image classiﬁcation tasks, CCE can be applied to other data modalities such as text, audio, and video
data, as well as other tasks such as regression and segmentation. Finally, we seek to do user studies to
understand how human subjects respond to explanations with CCE and how it drives improvements
in model debiasing and robustness."

LEARNING CONCEPTS"
REFERENCES,0.6238532110091743,"Here we provide implementational details on how we learn the concept activation vectors (CAVs).
Concretely, we pick a bottleneck layer in our model, which is the representation space in which we
will learn our features. Unless otherwise stated, we choose the penultimate layer in ResNet18 for
experiments in this paper. Let m be the dimensionality of the bottleneck layer L, and bL : Rd →Rm
be the “bottom” of the network, which maps samples from the input space to the bottleneck layer,
and tL : Rm →Rk be the “top” of the network, deﬁned analogously. In generating conceptual
explanations, the ﬁrst step is to deﬁne a concept library: a set of human-interpretable concepts
C = {c1, c2, ...} that occur in the dataset. For each concept, we collect positive examples, Pci, that
exhibit the concept, as well as negative examples, Nci, in which the concept is absent. Then, we train
a support vector machine to classify {bL(x) : x ∈Pci} from {bL(x) : x ∈Nci}, the same way as
in Kim et al. (2018). Overall pseudocode for the procedure can be found in Figure 5."

EXPLANATION ARTIFACTS"

explanations by CCE. Concepts are represented as vectors in the embedding space, and there may be
similarities among them. Hence, water or ashcan concepts may be very similar to certain textures
that are relevant to the dermatology task, where it was not possible to obtain the true concept itself.
The practitioner using CCE to explain the mistake can easily discard these artifacts suggested by
CCE, where there is also concepts that are more relevant and obtained larger scores. Secondly, as
the user keeps using concept-based methods, they can understand what type of concepts is needed,
or is relevant to the task. Accordingly, it is possible to update and obtain a more informative bank.
Generally, there are various interesting directions that could be pursued in the human-machine
interface that would improve the real-life performance of explanation algorithms. We are also
interested in further understanding this, and think more about the deployment aspects of CCE in
future work."

ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES VALIDATING CCE THROUGH LOW-LEVEL IMAGE
PERTURBATIONS"

SqueezeNet(Iandola et al., 2016) pretrained on ImageNet. Particularly, the ImagetNet dataset on
which SqueezeNet was trained includes a class of green apples known as Granny Smith. These images
were always colored in ImageNet, meaning that the model misclassiﬁes images of these apples in
grayscale. We can use this fact to gradually transform a natural image of a Granny Smith apple,"
