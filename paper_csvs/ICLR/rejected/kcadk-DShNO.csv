ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0037735849056603774,"Unsupervised dataset alignment estimates a transformation that maps two or more
source domains to a shared aligned domain given only the domain datasets. This
task has many applications including generative modeling, unsupervised domain
adaptation, and socially aware learning. Most prior works use adversarial learn-
ing (i.e., min-max optimization), which can be challenging to optimize and eval-
uate. A few recent works explore non-adversarial flow-based (i.e., invertible) ap-
proaches, but they lack a unified perspective. Therefore, we propose to unify and
generalize previous flow-based approaches under a single non-adversarial frame-
work, which we prove is equivalent to minimizing an upper bound on the Jensen-
Shannon Divergence (JSD). Importantly, our problem reduces to a min-min, i.e.,
cooperative, problem and can provide a natural evaluation metric for unsupervised
dataset alignment. We present empirical results of our framework on both simu-
lated and real-world datasets to demonstrate the benefits of our approach."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.011320754716981131,"In many cases, a practitioner has access to multiple related but distinct datasets such as agricultural
measurements from two farms, experimental data collected in different months, or sales data before
and after a major event. Unsupervised dataset alignment (UDA) is the ML task aimed at aligning
these related but distinct datasets in a shared space, which may be a latent space, without any pairing
information between the two domains (i.e., unsupervised). This task has many applications such
as generative modeling (e.g., (Zhu et al., 2017)), unsupervised domain adaptation (e.g., (Grover
et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2018)), batch effect mitigation in biology (e.g., (Haghverdi et al., 2018)), and
fairness-aware learning (e.g., (Zemel et al., 2013))."
INTRODUCTION,0.01509433962264151,"The most common approach for obtaining such alignment transformations stems from Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN)(Goodfellow et al., 2014), which can be viewed as minimizing a lower
bound on the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between real and generated distributions. The
lower bound is tight if and only if the inner maximization is solved perfectly. CycleGAN (Zhu et al.,
2017) maps between two datasets via two GAN objectives between the two domains and a cycle
consistency loss, which encourages approximate invertibility of the transformations. However, ad-
versarial learning can be challenging to optimize in practice (see e.g. (Lucic et al., 2018; Kurach
et al., 2019)) in part because of the competitive nature of the min-max optimization problem. Per-
haps more importantly, the research community only has reasonable GAN evaluation metrics for
certain data types. Specifically, the commonly accepted Frechet Inception Distance (FID) (Heusel
et al., 2017) is only applicable to image or auditory data, which have standard powerful pretrained
classifiers, and even the implementation of FID can have evaluation issues (Parmar et al., 2021). No
clear metrics exist for tabular data or non-perceptual data."
INTRODUCTION,0.018867924528301886,"Recently, flow-based methods that leverage invertible models have been proposed for the UDA task
(Grover et al., 2020; Usman et al., 2020). AlignFlow (Grover et al., 2020) leverages invertible

Figure 1: Overview of our proposed method. In our framework, domain specific transformation
functions {Tj(¬∑)}k
j=1 and a density model Q are cooperatively trained to make the transformed
representations be indistinguishable in the shared latent space. (a) 1-D example. By minimizing our
proposed AUB loss, the transformation functions T1 and T2 are trained to map the corresponding
distributions PX1 and PX2 to latent distributions PT1(X1) and PT2(X2) that have higher likelihood
with respect to a base distribution Q. The density model Q, on the other hand, is trained to fit the
mixture of the latent distributions PT1(X1) and PT2(x2). (b) Intuitively, the optimization process of
our method can be seen to make the Q distribution tight around the mixture of latent distributions to
increase the likelihood (i.e., MLE) while the transformation functions T1 and T2 are encouraged to
expand to fill the latent space defined by Q. Eventually, the latent distributions and Q are converge
to be the same distribution, which means that they are aligned."

REGULARIZED ALIGNMENT UPPER BOUND LOSS,0.07924528301886792,"Background: Normalizing Flows and Invertible Models
Normalizing flows are generative
models that have tractable distributions where exact density evaluations and efficient samplings
are ensured (Kobyzev et al., 2021). Such models leverage the change of variables formula to cre-
ate an invertible mapping T such that PX(x) = PZ(T(x))|JT (x)| where PZ is a known latent
distribution and |JT (x)| is the absolute value of determinant of the Jacobian of the invertible map
T. For sampling in distribution PX, one need to first sample from the latent distribution PZ and
then apply the inverse transform T ‚àí1. Therefore the key challenge in designing invertible models
is to have computationally efficient inverse evaluation and Jacobian determinant calculation. Many
approaches have been proposed by parameterizing mapping function T as deep neural networks in-
cluding autoregressive structures (Kingma et al., 2016; Papamakarios et al., 2021), coupling layers
(Dinh et al., 2017)(Kingma and Dhariwal, 2018), oridinary differential equations(Grathwohl et al.,
2018), and invertible residual networks(Chen et al., 2019; Behrmann et al., 2019). Flow models can
be then learned efficiently by maximizing the likelihood for the given data."

between any of the observed component distributions. The proof follows directly from Theorem 3

AlignFlow (Grover et al., 2020) without
adversarial loss terms is a special case of our method for two distributions where the density model
class Q only contains the standard normal distribution (i.e., a singleton class) and no regularization
is used (i.e., Œª = 0). Thus, AlignFlow can be viewed as initially optimizing a poor upper bound on
JSD; however, the JSD bound becomes tighter as training progresses because the latent distributions

RELATIONSHIP TO PRIOR WORKS,0.3283018867924528,"Cooperative networks versus adversarial networks
Analogous to the generator G and the dis-
criminator D in adversarial learning, our framework has two main networks, Tj and Qz. We can
use any invertible function for Tj (e.g., coupling-based flows (Dinh et al., 2017), neural ODE flows
(Grathwohl et al., 2018), or residual flows (Chen et al., 2019)) and any (approximate) density models
for Qz (e.g., kernel densities (in low dimensions), mixture models, autoregressive densities (Sali-
mans et al., 2017), normalizing flows (Kingma and Dhariwal, 2018), or even VAEs (Kingma and
Welling, 2019)). Thus, our framework has similar modularity compared to adversarial approaches.
In contrast, we have a min-min, i.e., cooperative, optimization problem, but our transformations
must be invertible. As another difference, the inner optimization problem may be more challenging
(i.e., fitting a density model Qz may be more difficult than fitting an auxiliary discriminator D), but
the overall min-min is likely to be more stable than the min-max problem‚Äîspecifically, note that
our problem can align even if the density model Qz is not optimal (see Theorem 3). We expect some
of these limitations to be alleviated as new invertible models and density models are continually be-
ing developed. Therefore, the proposed approach provides a fundamental alternative to adversarial
learning with different strengths and weaknesses."

et al., 2020) method. We construct the experiment to have the task: Translation between the two
half-circled distributions: X1 and X2 in the moons dataset. In this example, we made two models,
one with LRMF setup and one with our AUB setup. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the LRMF method
fails to transform between X1 and X2. Even though Q can model well enough for T1(X1), Q can
only model the mean and variance of X2 which is obviously not informative enough. Therefore, the
LRMF fails to transform between two datasets. While in the AUB setup, both T1(X1) and T2(X2)
are modeled to the same distribution which Q can be learned to fit with high likelihood which leads
to better translation results. In conclusion, the performance of the LRMF model is limited by the
power of the density model Q which means if Q fails to model one of the domain distribution in
high likelihood, data alignment cannot be achieved with good performances.
Simple Fixed Q vs. Learnable Q (AlignFlow vs. Ours)
Next we compare our method with
AlignFlow(Grover et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2018) setup. We construct the experiment to have the task:
Transform between the two random patterns X1 and X2 from the randomly generated datasets.
Again, we made two models with AlignFlow and our AUB setups respectively. As illustrated in
Fig. 3, the AlignFlow method fails to transform between X1 and X2, because the transformed dataset
T1(X1) and T2(X2) failed to reach the normal distribution Q. While in the AUB setup, the density
model Q is learned to help fit the transformed distributions T1(X1) and T2(X2), which allows them
to be aligned with each other easier. In conclusion, the performance of the AlignFlow model is
limited by the performances of the invertible functions.
Regularized vs. Un-regularized (Some prior works vs. Ours)
We finally show the importance
of the regularization term. We construct the experiment to have the task: Transform between two
concentric circles with the same mean but slighted different radius. In this example, we make two
models with our AUB approach, but one with regularization and one without. As illustrated in the
Figure 4, both models are able to transform between two distributions. However, the transformation
pattern is not natural in terms of the movement of each point. Each pair created by the unregularized
model has bigger transportation cost compared to the pairs created by the regularized model. There-
fore, we suggest that by adding transportation cost, the resulting transformation between samples
will be closer to the identity function and therefore more stable."

model Q. We evaluate our model performances in Table 1 along with baseline models: LRMF and
MLE version of AlignFlow. Note that all methods are flow-based models and thus images translated
back to original domain are exactly the same, which implies exact cycle consistency."
REAL-WORLD DATASETS,0.37358490566037733,"As represented in Table. 1, both of our approaches outperform the baseline models in terms of FID
and AUB. The lower score in AUB indicates our model has the tighter bound than baseline model.
This implies the statistical distance between the shared distribution {Zj}k
j=1 and our density model
Q is smaller than baselines, meaning our model has the better dataset alignment performance. We
believe this result comes from our model setup, i.e., a learnable density model and domain specific
invertible transformation functions with shared space. Specifically, AlignFlow with a fixed standard
normal distribution as their Q obtains worse AUB because the Q is not powerful enough to model
the complex shared space trained from the real world dataset. On the other hand, LRMF shows the
lack of stability when trained with relatively simple models that we are using, i.e., RealNVP T and
Real NVP Q. This is because the transformation function and the density model should be able to
directly model the complex real distribution in their setup. By comparing our approach with and
without transportation cost, we observe introducing transportation cost yields insignificant decrease
in AUB and an increase in FID. This indicates the transportation cost regularizes our method well
without degeneration, so that our method can find better solution (which is theoretically unique)."

comes from the lack of expressivity of their Q model. On the other hand, our model shows stable
results across all translation cases, which are also quantitatively verified via the lower FID score.

To illustrate that our method can be easily scaled to more domain
distributions, we present qualitative examples of translating between every digit and every other
digit for MNIST in Fig. 6 with performances in Table 2. To show the effect of transportation cost
proposed in our paper, we also compare our model with and without transportation cost. Note that
we omit LRMF in this experiment because the multi-domain situation is hard to deal with for LRMF
setup due to LRMF‚Äôs two distribution setup and assymetric model structure."
REAL-WORLD DATASETS,0.4188679245283019,"As shown in Table 2, our approach with and without transportation cost shows better performance
in terms of FID and AUB than AlignFlow since our learnable density estimator can model more
complex distribution than fixed simple density model in AlignFlow. In other words, the shared
space of AlignFlow is limited because of the fixed simple density model. Note that the gap in the
AUB score between AlignFow and our model is larger in this multi-domain setting (Table 2) than
in the two domain case (Table 1). We hypothesize that this is because the shared density model
across many domains needs to be more complex than for only two domains and thus, our learnable
Q can create a better upper bound to optimize than AlignFlow. In this experiment, while ours with
transportation cost performs slightly worse, the results are comparable and it does provide a natural
regularization that ensures a theoretically identifiable solution."

latent Tk(xk) into 10 inverse transformation functions, respectively. It is easy to observe that ours
has more clear results in most cases than baseline. Moreover, our model shows better performance
in maintaining the original identity (e.g., width and type of a stroke) than the baseline, as seen in
third, fourth and ninth rows. This is because we jointly train our transformation functions with a
learnable density model, while AlignFlow independently train their transformation functions. This
benefit of our approach may be crucial for other datasets such as human faces (Choi et al., 2018)
where maintaining the original identity is important."

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION,0.4528301886792453,"Generative Tasks

to sample from the density model Q to have a latent image z first, and then forward to the inverse
function T ‚àí1

to get the image sampled in jth domain. Examples of generated images for each
domain in MNIST data are shown in Fig. 7(b). The quality of the generative result also reflects the

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION,0.47924528301886793,"In this paper, we proposed a novel upper bound on the generalized JSD that leads to a theoretically
grounded alignment loss function. We then show that this framework unifies previous flow-based
approaches to dataset alignment and demonstrate the benefits of our approach compared to prior
flow-based methods. Additionally, we show that our framework could enable the use of pre-trained
density models which would enable a type of transfer learning for distribution alignment. More
broadly, we expect that our AUB metric can be useful as a domain-agnostic metric for comparing
dataset alignment methods beyond images. An alignment metric that is not tied to a particular
pretrained model (as for FID) or to a particular data type will be critical for systematic progress in
unsupervised dataset alignment. We hope this paper provides one step in that direction."
