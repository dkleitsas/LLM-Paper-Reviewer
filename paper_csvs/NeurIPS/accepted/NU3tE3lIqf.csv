ABSTRACT,0.004098360655737705,"While the field of 3D scene reconstruction is dominated by NeRFs due to their pho-
torealistic quality, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged, offering
similar quality with real-time rendering speeds. However, both methods primarily
excel with well-controlled 3D scenes, while in-the-wild data – characterized by oc-
clusions, dynamic objects, and varying illumination – remains challenging. NeRFs
can adapt to such conditions easily through per-image embedding vectors, but
3DGS struggles due to its explicit representation and lack of shared parameters. To
address this, we introduce WildGaussians, a novel approach to handle occlusions
and appearance changes with 3DGS. By leveraging robust DINO features and
integrating an appearance modeling module within 3DGS, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate that WildGaussians matches the real-time
rendering speed of 3DGS while surpassing both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in
handling in-the-wild data, all within a simple architectural framework."

objective is to achieve a multi-view consistent 3D scene representation from a set of input images
with known camera poses, enabling photorealistic rendering from novel viewpoints."
INTRODUCTION,0.02459016393442623,"Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [1, 25, 37, 30, 38, 26, 9, 17, 29] have addressed this
challenge by learning a radiance field, which combines a density field and a viewing-direction-
dependent color field. These fields are rendered using volumetric rendering [12]. Despite producing
highly realistic renderings, NeRFs require evaluating numerous samples from the field per pixel to
accurately approximate the volumetric integral. Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [14, 50, 49, 51, 15, 54]
has emerged as a faster alternative. 3DGS explicitly represents the scene as a set of 3D Gaussians,
which enables real-time rendering via rasterization at a rendering quality comparable to NeRFs."
INTRODUCTION,0.028688524590163935,"Learning scene representations from training views alone introduces an ambiguity between geometry
and view-dependent effects. Both NeRFs and 3DGS are designed to learn consistent geometry while
simulating non-Lambertian effects, resolving ambiguity through implicit biases in the representation.
This works well in controlled settings with consistent illumination and minimal occlusion but typically
fails under varying conditions and larger levels of occlusion. However, in practical applications,
images are captured without control over the environment. Examples include crowd-sourced 3D re-
constructions [34, 1], where images are collected at different times, seasons, and exposure levels, and
reconstructions that keep 3D models up-to-date via regular image recapturing. Besides environmental
condition changes, e.g., day-night changes, such images normally contain occluders, e.g., pedestrians
and cars, with which we need to deal with during the reconstruction process."
INTRODUCTION,0.03278688524590164,"NeRF-based approaches handle appearance changes by conditioning the MLP that presents the
radiance field on an appearance embedding capturing specific image appearances [24, 38, 24].
This enables them to learn a class of multi-view consistent 3D representations, conditioned on the
embedding. However, this approach does not extend well to explicit representations such as 3DGS
[14], which store the colors of geometric primitives explicitly. Adding an MLP conditioned on an
appearance embedding would slow down rendering, as each frame would require evaluating the MLP
for all Gaussians. For occlusion handling, NeRFs [24, 31] use uncertainty modeling to discount
losses from challenging pixels. However, in cases with both appearance changes and occlusions,
these losses are not robust, often incorrectly focusing on regions with difficult-to-capture appearances
instead of focusing on the occluders. While NeRFs can recover from early mistakes due to parameter
sharing, 3DGS, with its faster training and engineered primitive growth and pruning process, cannot,
as an incorrect training signal can lead to irreversibly removing parts of the geometry."
INTRODUCTION,0.036885245901639344,"To address the issues, we propose to enhance Gaussians with trainable appearance embeddings and
using a small MLP to integrate image and appearance embeddings to predict an affine transformation
of the base color. This MLP is required only during training or when capturing the appearance of a
new image. After this phase, the appearance can be ""baked"" back into the standard 3DGS formulation,
ensuring fast rendering while maintaining the editability and flexibility of the 3DGS representation
[14]. For robust occlusion handling, we introduce an uncertainty predictor with a loss based on DINO
features [27], effectively eliminating occluders during training despite appearance changes."
INTRODUCTION,0.040983606557377046,"Our contributions can be summarized as: (1) Appearance Modeling: Extending 3DGS [14] with a
per-Gaussian trainable embedding vector coupled with a tone-mapping MLP, enabling the rendered
image to be conditioned on a specific input image’s embedding. This extension preserves rendering
speed and maintains compatibility with 3DGS [14]. (2) Uncertainty Optimization: Introducing an
uncertainty optimization scheme robust to appearance changes, which does not disrupt the gradient
statistics used in adaptive density control. This scheme leverages the cosine similarity of DINO
v2 [27] features between training and predicted images to create an uncertainty mask, effectively
removing the influence of occluders during training. The source code, model checkpoints, and video

GAUSSIANS",0.10655737704918032,"Novel View Synthesis for Unstructured Photo Collections. In real-world scenes, e.g. the unstruc-
tured internet photo collections [35], difficulties arise not only from dynamic occlusions like moving
pedestrians and vehicles but also from varying illumination. Previously, these issues were tackled
using multi-plane image (MPI) methods [20]. More recently, NeRF-W [24], a pioneering work in
this area, addresses these challenges with per-image transient and appearance embeddings, along
with leveraging aleatoric uncertainty for transient object removal. However, the method suffers from
slow training and rendering speeds. Other NeRF-based methods followed NeRF-W extending it
in various ways [37, 47]. Recent concurrent works, including our own, explore the replacement of
NeRF representations with 3DGS for this task. Some methods [33, 6] address the simpler problem
of training 3DGS under heavy occlusions, or only tackling appearance changes [23, 48, 8] with no
occlusions. However, the main challenge is integrating appearance conditioning with the locally inde-
pendent 3D Gaussians under occlusions. VastGaussian [22] applies a convolutional network to 3DGS
outputs which does not transfer to large appearance changes, as shown in the Appendix. SWAG [5]
and Scaffold-GS [23] address this by storing appearance data in an external hash-grid-based implicit
field [26], while GS-W [52] and WE-GS [41] utilize CNN features for appearance conditioning on a
reference image. In contrast, our method employs a simpler and more scalable strategy by embedding
appearance vectors directly within each Gaussian. This design not only simplifies the architecture
but also enables us to ’bake’ the trained representation back into 3DGS after appearances are fixed,
enhancing both efficiency and adaptability. Finally, a concurrent work, Splatfacto-W [45], uses a
similar appearance MLP to combine Gaussian and image embeddings to output spherical harmonics."

METHOD,0.11475409836065574,"Our approach, termed WildGaussians, is shown in Fig. 2. To allow 3DGS-based approaches to handle
the uncontrolled capture of scenes, we propose two key components: (1) appearance modeling
enables our approach to handle the fact that the observed pixel colors not only depend on the
viewpoint but also on conditions such as the capture time and the weather. Following NeRF-based
approaches for reconstructing scenes from images captured under different conditions [24, 30], we
train an appearance embedding per training image to model such conditions. In addition, we train
an appearance embedding per Gaussian to model local effects, e.g., active illumination of parts of
the scene from lamps. Both embeddings are used to transform the color stored for a Gaussian to
match the color expected for a given scene appearance. To this end, we predict an affine mapping"

during the training stage by determining which regions of a training image should be ignored. To this
end, we extract DINO v2 features [27] from training images, and pass them as input to a trainable
affine transformation which predicts a per-pixel uncertainty, encoding which parts of an image likely
correspond to static regions and which parts show occluders. The uncertainty predictor is optimized
using the cosine similarity between the DINO features extracted from training images and renderings."

Experiments"
EXPERIMENTS,0.36065573770491804,"Datasets. We evaluate our WildGaussians approach on two challenging datasets. The NeRF On-
the-go dataset [31] contains multiple casually captured indoor and outdoor sequences, with varying
ratios of occlusions (from 5% to 30%). For evaluation, the dataset provides 6 sequences in total.
Note that there are almost no illumination changes across views in this dataset. Since 3DGS [14]
cannot handle radially distorted images, we train and evaluate our method and all baselines on a
version of the dataset where all images were undistorted. The Photo Tourism dataset [35] consists
of multiple 3D scenes of well-known monuments. Each scene has an unconstrained collection of
images uploaded by users captured at different dates and times of day with different cameras and
exposure levels. In our experiments we use the Brandenburg Gate, Sacre Coeur, and Trevi Fountain
scenes, which have an average ratio of occlusions of 3.5%. Note, that for each dataset (both NeRF
On-the-go and Photo Tourism), the test set was carefully chosen not to have any occluders."

we compare to NeRF On-the-go [31], the original 3DGS formulation [14], Mip-Splatting [50], and

scenarios with medium (15-20%) to high occlusions (30%). Compared to NeRF On-the-go [31], our

we can better represent distant and less-frequently seen background regions (first and third row
in Fig. 4). Interestingly, 3DGS and its derivatives (Mip-Splatting, Gaussian Opacity Fields) are quite
robust to scenes with low occlusion ratios, thanks to its geometry prior in the form of the initial point
cloud. Nevertheless, 3DGS and its derivatives struggles to remove occlusions for high-occlusion
scenes. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our uncertainty modeling strategy."

details, as can be noticed in the flowing water and text on the Trevi Fountain. Compared to 3DGS [14],
our method has comparable rendering speed on the NeRF On-the-go dataset, while being much faster
on the Photo Tourism dataset [35]. This is caused by 3DGS [14] trying to grow unnecessary Gaussians
to explain higher gradients due to the appearance variation. Finally, compared to other 3DGS-based
methods [52, 5], ours achieves stronger performance while having faster inference because we can
‘bake’ the apperance-tuned spherical harmonics back into the standard 3DGS representation."

improves performance. We conclude that it is safe to use appearance embeddings, even if there might
not be strong appearance changes. Similarly, disabling uncertainty modeling has little impact on
datasets with less occlusions and could even make the performance slightly worse for the On-the-go
low dataset, but it is required for the high-occlusion datasets (On-the-go high and Photo Tourism)."

ABLATION STUDIES & ANALYSIS,0.46311475409836067,"As expected, for dataset with low occlusion ratios,
disabling uncertainty modeling has a limited impact
on the overall performance. We attribute this to the
inherent robustness of 3DGS, where the initial 3D
point clouds also help to filter out some occlusions.
However, as the occlusion ratio increases, the im-
portance of uncertainty modeling becomes evident.
This is shown by the significant performance drop
when using no uncertainty modeling for the NeRF
On-the-go high occlusion dataset."
ABLATION STUDIES & ANALYSIS,0.4672131147540984,"Behavior of the appearance embedding. Fig. 6 in-
terpolates between two appearance embeddings. The
transition from the source view to the target view’s ap-
pearance is smooth, with lights gradually appearing.
This demonstrates the smoothness and the continu-
ous nature of the embedding space. In Fig. 7, we
interpolate between two camera poses with a fixed
appearance embedding showing multiview consis-
tency. Next, we further analyze the embedding space
with a t-SNE [39] projection of the embeddings of
training images. The t-SNE visualization in Fig. 8 reveals that the embeddings are grouped by image
appearances, e.g., with night images clustering together and being separated from other images."

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.47540983606557374,"Our WildGaussians model extends Gaussian Splatting to uncontrolled in-the-wild settings where
images are captured across different time or seasons, normally with occluders of different ratios. The
key to the success are our novel appearance and uncertainty modeling tailored for 3DGS, which also
ensures high-quality real-time rendering. We believe our method is a step toward achieving robust
and versatile photorealistic reconstruction from noisy, crowd-sourced data sources."
CONCLUSION,0.47950819672131145,"Limitations. While our method enables appearance modeling with real-time rendering, it is currently
not able to capture highlights on objects. Additionally, although the uncertainty modeling is more
robust than MSE or SSIM, it still struggles with some challenging scenarios. If there are not enough
observations of a part of the scene, e.g., because it is occluded in nearly all training images, our
approach will struggle to correctly reconstruct the region. One way to handle this is to incorporate
additional priors such as pre-trained diffusion models. We leave it as future work."

[50]. Furthermore, we extended the implementation by the AbsGaussian/Gaussian Opacity Fields
absolute gradient scaling fix [51, 49]. All our experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX
4090 GPU. For the uncertainty modeling, we use the ViT-S/14 DINO v2 features (smallest DINO
configuration) [27]. We also resize the images before computing DINO features to the max. size of
350 to make the DINO loss computation faster. To model the appearance, we use embeddings of size
24 for the Gaussians and 32 for the image appearance embeddings. For the appearance MLP, we use
2 hidden layers of size 128. We use the ReLU activation function. We use the Adam optimizer [16]
without weight decay. For test-time appearance embedding optimization, we perform 128 Adam’s
gradient descent steps with the learning rate of 0.1. For the main training objective λdssim to 0.2 and
λuncert to 0.5. We now describe the hyper-parameters used for the two datasets (Photo Tourism [35],

effectiveness of the uncertainty modeling. However, for the Trevi Fountain, the uncertainty does not
improve the performance, which is likely caused by 1) the scene has a small number of occlusions, 2)
the water in the scene is often mistaken for a transient object as it is not multi-view consistent. For
reference, we also included a comparison with a method trained with explicit segmentation masks
obtained from the MaskRCNN predictor [11]."
