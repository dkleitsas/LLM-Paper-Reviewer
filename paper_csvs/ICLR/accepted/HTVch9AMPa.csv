ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0048543689320388345,"Advanced representation learning techniques require reliable and general evalu-
ation methods. Recently, several algorithms based on the common idea of geo-
metric and topological analysis of a manifold approximated from the learned data
representations have been proposed. In this work, we introduce Delaunay Com-
ponent Analysis (DCA) – an evaluation algorithm which approximates the data
manifold using a more suitable neighbourhood graph called Delaunay graph. This
provides a reliable manifold estimation even for challenging geometric arrange-
ments of representations such as clusters with varying shape and density as well
as outliers, which is where existing methods often fail. Furthermore, we exploit
the nature of Delaunay graphs and introduce a framework for assessing the quality
of individual novel data representations. We experimentally validate the proposed
DCA method on representations obtained from neural networks trained with con-
trastive objective, supervised and generative models, and demonstrate various use
cases of our extended single point evaluation framework."

INTRODUCTION,0.019417475728155338,"Quality evaluation of learned data representations is gain-
ing attention in the machine learning community due to
the booming development of representation learning tech-
niques. One common approach is to assess representa-
tion quality based on their performance on a pre-designed
downstream task (Bevilacqua et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020).
Typically, a classification problem is used to evaluate ei-
ther the ability of a model to recover labels of raw in-
puts, or the transferability of their representations to other
domains, as done in state-of-the-art unsupervised repre-
sentation learning methods (Chen et al., 2020b; Ermolov
et al., 2021). However, in many scenarios such straight-
forward downstream classification task cannot be defined,
for instance, because it does not represent the nature of
the application or due to the scarcity of labeled data as of-
ten occurs in robotics (Chamzas et al., 2021; Lippi et al.,
2020). In these scenarios, representations are commonly
evaluated on hand-crafted downstream tasks, e.g., spe-
cific robotics tasks. However, these are time consuming
to design, and potentially also bias evaluation procedures
and consequentially hinder generalization of representa-
tions across different tasks."
INTRODUCTION,0.024271844660194174,"Recently, more general evaluation methods such as Ge-
ometry Score (GS) (Khrulkov & Oseledets, 2018), Im-
proved Precision and Recall (IPR) (Kynk¨a¨anniemi et al.,
2019) and Geometric Component Analysis (GeomCA) (Poklukar et al., 2021) have been proposed."

INTRODUCTION,0.03398058252427184,"These methods analyze global geometric and topological properties of representation spaces instead
of relying on specific pre-designed downstream tasks. These works assume that a set of evaluation
representations E is of high quality if it closely mimics the structure of the true data manifold cap-
tured by a reference set of representations R. This reasoning implies that R and E must have similar
geometric and topological properties, such as connected components, their number and size, which
are extracted from various approximations of the data manifolds corresponding to R and E. For ex-
ample, GS and GeomCA estimate the manifolds using simplicial complexes and proximity graphs,
respectively, while IPR leverages a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) based approximation. However, as
we discuss in Section 2, neither of these approaches provides a reliable manifold estimate in com-
plex arrangements of R and E, for instance, when points form clusters of varying shape and density
as well as in the presence of outliers. Moreover, the informativeness of the scores introduced by
these methods is limited."
INTRODUCTION,0.038834951456310676,"In this work, we address the impediments of evaluation of learned representations arising from poor
manifold approximations by relying on a more natural estimate using Delaunay graphs. As seen in
Figure 1, edges (solid lines) in a Delaunay graph connect spacial neighbours and thus vary in length.
In this way, they naturally capture local changes in the density of the representation space and thus
more reliably detect outliers, all without depending on hyperparameters. We propose an evaluation
framework called Delaunay Component Analysis (DCA) which builds the Delaunay graph on the
union R ∪E, extracts its connected components, and applies existing geometric evaluation scores
to analyze them. We experimentally validate DCA on a variety of setups by evaluating contrastive
representations (Section 4.1), generative models (Section 4.2) and supervised models (Section 4.3)."
INTRODUCTION,0.043689320388349516,"Furthermore, we exploit the natural neighbourhood structure of Delaunay graphs to evaluate a single
query representation. This is crucial in applications with continuous stream of data, for example, in
interactions of an intelligent agent with the environment or in the assessment of the visual quality of
individual images generated by a generative model as also explored by Kynk¨a¨anniemi et al. (2019).
In these cases, existing representation spaces need to be updated either by embedding novel query
points or distinguishing them from previously seen ones. In Delaunay graphs, this translates to
analyzing newly added edges to the given query point. We demonstrate various possible analyses in
Section 4 using aforementioned experimental setups."

STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS"
STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS,0.05339805825242718,"We review the state-of-the-art methods for evaluation of learned data representations, namely
GS (Khrulkov & Oseledets, 2018), IPR (Kynk¨a¨anniemi et al., 2019) and GeomCA (Poklukar et al.,
2021), which compare topological and geometrical properties of an evaluation set E with a refer-
ence set R representing the true underlying data manifold. We discuss differences in their manifold
approximations, visualized in Figure 2, as well as informativeness of their scores."
STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS,0.05825242718446602,"Figure 2: Visualization of manifold approximations obtained by GS (a), IPR (b), GeomCA without
sparsification (c), GeomCA with sparsification (d) and our proposed DCA (e)."
STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS,0.06310679611650485,"The pioneering method in this area, GS, constructs witness simplicial complexes on randomly sam-
pled subsets of R and E (panel (a)), and compares their connected components using tools of com-
putational topology (Zomorodian & Carlsson, 2004). The result is an average over several iterations
summarized either in the form of histograms, which are cumbersome for quantitative comparison, or
as a single un-normalized score, which is in many cases not sufficiently informative. Moreover, GS"
STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS,0.06796116504854369,"depends on four hyperparameters, which can be difficult to understand and tuned by practitioners
unfamiliar with computational topology."
STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS,0.07281553398058252,"In contrast, IPR obtains manifold approximations by enlarging each point in R (or E) with a hy-
persphere of radius equal to the distance to its kNN in that set (panel (b)). It defines two scores:
precision PI which counts the number of E points contained on the approximated R manifold, and
vice versa for recall RI. While the method depends only on one hyperparameter k, it is highly
affected by outliers which induce overly large spheres and dense areas of the space which yield too
conservative coverage as visualized in panel (b). Moreover, it is the only method expecting R and
E to be of equal size, thus, often requiring subsampling of one of them. Both GS and IPR have been
primarily developed to assess generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014)."
STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS,0.07766990291262135,"The most recent and generally applicable method, GeomCA, extends GS and IPR in two ways: i) it
provides functionality to analyze individual connected components of the approximated manifold,
hence enabling one to examine local areas of representation spaces where inconsistencies arise, and
ii) characterizes the captured geometry in four global scores: precision PG and recall RG, which are
similar to IPR, as well as network consistency cG and network quality qG, which are also the basis
of the GeomCA local evaluation scores (see Section 3 for recap). GeomCA estimates the manifolds
using ε-proximity graphs where the hyperparameter ε defines the maximum distance between two
points connected by an edge and is estimated from distances among points in R. However, in
practice, representations often form clusters of different shape and density which makes it impossible
to select a single value of ε that adequately captures such variations (see examples in panel (c))."
STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS,0.0825242718446602,"Moreover, GeomCA reduces the number of points by performing geometric sparsification that ex-
tracts a subset of points from each of R and E being pairwise at least distance δ apart, where δ is
estimated from ε. While the authors argue that this step does not affect their scores as it preserves
the topology, we show that it nevertheless can bias the manifold estimation of R and E. An example
is illustrated in the bottom component of panels (c) and (d), where the sparsification removes a large
portion of the dense E subset and artificially increases the precision. We demonstrate the occurrence
of this scenario in the evaluation of a GAN model in Section 4.2."
STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS,0.08737864077669903,"Our DCA framework utilizes Delaunay graphs (panel (e)) to address the discussed limitations in
manifold approximations of the existing methods, and employs evaluation scores introduced by Pok-
lukar et al. (2021) to maximize its informativeness. Moreover, it extends the existing methods by
additionally providing a general framework for quality evaluation of single query representations."

METHOD"
METHOD,0.0970873786407767,"We propose Delaunay Component Analysis (DCA) algorithm for evaluation of data representations
consisting of three parts: i) manifold approximation which approximates the Delaunay graph on
the given sets of representations, ii) component distillation which distills the graph into connected
components, and lastly iii) component evaluation which outputs the evaluation scores summarizing
the geometry of the data. We provide an outline of our DCA framework in Algorithm 1 found
in Appendix A. Moreover, by exploiting the nature of Delaunay graphs, DCA can be efficiently
implemented (Section 3.2) and extended for evaluation of individual representations (Section 3.1)."
METHOD,0.10194174757281553,"Phase 1: Manifold approximation As mentioned in Section 1, the unique property of Delaunay
graphs is the definition of neighbouring points that are connected by an edge. For example, in an
ε-graph, two points are adjacent if they are at most ε distance apart. In a kNN graph, a point is
connected to all points that are closer than the k-th smallest distance of that point to any other. In
contrast, in a Delaunay graph (Figure 1), a point is adjacent to any point that is its spatial neighbour,
regardless of the actual distance between them or the number of its other spatial neighbours. We
refer to such spatial neighbours as natural neighbours of a point and rigorously define them through
Voronoi cells (depicted as dashed lines in Figure 1) in the following."

. The Delaunay graph GD(W) = (V, E) built on the
set V

=
{(zi, zj) ∈W × W | Cell(zi) ∩Cell(zj) ̸= ∅, zi ̸= zj}."

i=1 ⊂RN and evaluation set E = {zi}nE
i=1 ⊂RN of data
representations with R ̸= E, and approximate the Delaunay graph GD = GD(R ∪E). By Defini-
tion 3.1, edges in GD correspond to points on the boundary of Voronoi cells which are obtained using
Monte Carlo based sampling algorithm presented by Polianskii & Pokorny (2019) (see Appendix A
for further details). The process, visualized in Figure 3, is based on sampling rays originating from
each z ∈R ∪E and finding their intersection with the boundary of its Voronoi cell Cell(z). This
allows to reconstruct GD via subgraph approximation, and can be additionally exploited for memory
optimizations which we present in Section 3.2. Due to the sampling, the number of found edges
directly depends on the number T of rays sampled from each z. However, as we show in ablation
studies in Appendix B.1 and B.2, our evaluation framework is stable with respect to the variations
in T. Next, we discuss the distillation of GD into connected components."
METHOD,0.11650485436893204,"Phase 2: Component distillation Since edges in GD are obtained among natural neighbours, GD
consists of a single connected component uniting regions of points formed in different densities or
shape. These can be distinguished by removing large edges (depicted with transparent edges in
Figure 1), or equivalently, by finding clusters of points having similar natural neighbours (depicted
with opaque edges in Figure 1)."

METHOD,0.1262135922330097,"We distill GD into connected components by adapting the state-
of-the-art hierarchical clustering algorithm HDBSCAN (McInnes
et al., 2017) summarized in Appendix A. We apply the part of HDB-
SCAN that extracts connected components {Gi} from the minimum
spanning tree1 MST(GD). We emphasise that applying HDBSCAN
directly on MST(GD) efficiently bypasses the calculation of a com-
plete pairwise distance matrix2 of size nR + nE which becomes
a computational burden for large R and E sets. Such calculation
is an integral part of HDBSCAN performed to reduce the sensitiv-
ity of the method to noise or outliers which can be omitted in case
of Delaunay graphs due their natural neighbourhood structure (see
Appendix A for further details). In this way, our modification of
HDBSCAN inherits only one of its original hyperparameters, the
minimum cluster size mcs parameter, determining the minimum
number of points needed for a set of points to form a cluster. This
parameter is intuitive to tune and can be flexibly adjusted depending
on the nature of the application. In our ablation studies reported in
Appendix B.1 and B.2, we show that DCA is stable with respect to variations in mcs. At the end of
this phase, we obtain the distilled Delaunay graph GDD = F"

G when no confusion arises. Lastly, we analyze the components of G as summarized below."
METHOD,0.13592233009708737,"Phase 3: Component evaluation We analyze the connected components Gi of G using local and
global evaluation scores introduced by Poklukar et al. (2021) which we recap below. Following
their notation, we denote by |G|V and |G|E the cardinalities of the vertex and edge sets of a graph
G = (V, E), respectively, and by GQ = (V|Q, E|Q×Q) ⊂G its restriction to a set Q ⊂V."
METHOD,0.1407766990291262,"We start by introducing the two local scores: component consistency and quality. Intuitively, a
component Gi attains high consistency if it is equally represented by points from R and E, i.e., if
|GR

i denote the restrictions of Gi to R and E. Similarly, Gi obtains a
high quality score if points from R and E are also well mixed which is measured in terms of edges
connecting R and E, i.e., the points are geometrically well aligned if the number of homogeneous
edges among points in each of the sets, |GR

erogeneous edges connecting representations from R and E. This is rigorously defined as follows:"

measure global imbalances and misalignment between R and E, can be simply derived by extending
Definition 3.2 to the entire graph G. In summary, we consider the following global evaluation scores:"

EXTENSION: QUERY POINT INSERTION AND EVALUATION"
METHOD,0.20388349514563106,"A practical evaluation framework should not only provide a functionality to analyse sets of represen-
tations but also to assess the quality of individual points with respect to R, which is desirable in any
application where data is being collected continuously. In case of Delaunay graphs, evaluating the
quality of a query point q ⊂RN\R is equivalent to studying its insertion into the distilled Delaunay
graph GDD(R). Formally, we consider the neighbourhood N(q) of q in the distilled Delaunay graph
GDD(R ∪{q}) defined as the subgraph of GD(R ∪{q}) induced by all vertices adjacent to q includ-
ing q and intersected with GDD(R). To find the edges of N(q), it suffices to perform the sampling
process described in Phase 1 only within the Voronoi cell Cell(q) of GD. In fact, this process can be
efficiently performed for a set Q of query points independently from each other and has equal com-
putational complexity as the construction of GD(R) provided that |R| and |Q| are comparable. We
refer to this extension as query (point) Delaunay Component Analysis, or in short, q-DCA algorithm."
METHOD,0.2087378640776699,"The obtained neighbourhood graph N(q) = (VN(q), EN(q)) can be analyzed in numerous ways
depending on the application. In this work, we experiment with the length and the number of the
inserted edges in three ways: i) by extracting the point in R closest to q, ii) by additionally extracting
the length of that edge, or iii) by examining the number of inserted edges to each fundamental
component as well as the length of the shortest one. We provide a summary of the three variants in
Algorithm 2 in Appendix A and experimentally validate them in Section 4."

Cell(zi) ∩Cell(zj) normalized by the volume of the unit hypersphere. It is approximated by the
ratio of all rays sampled from zi that provided the corresponding edge (zi, zj) using the algorithm
of Polianskii & Pokorny (2019). Intuitively, low βij values correspond to edges that are unstable

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS"
COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS,0.24271844660194175,"The computational complexity of the Delaunay graph approximation performed in Phase 1 grows
polynomially with the dimensionality of representations N. Given that the number of points |R| +
|E| is at least linear corresponding to their dimensionality N, i.e. |R| + |E| = Ω(N), we utilize
the probabilistic method for the construction of the graph proposed by Polianskii & Pokorny (2019)
that yields the total complexity O((|R| + |E|)2 · (N + T)). The complexity for q-DCA is obtained
by substituting |E| with |Q| for a set of query points Q. Moreover, the asymptotics of the modified
HDBSCAN clustering algorithm utilized in Phase 2 rely on the graph obtained in Phase 1, which
again does not directly depend on the dimensionality N and is at most quadratic of the number of
points, i.e. O((|R| + |E|)2). Real computation times of Phase 1 and Phase 2 are comparable (see
Appendix B.1, Table 6), partially due to high GPU parallelization of Phase 1. We refer the reader
to (Polianskii & Pokorny, 2019), (Campello et al., 2015) and (McInnes & Healy, 2017) for details."

average P ≈0.57 for all p as well as increasing R with increasing p. Moreover, we observed the
scores to have a low std indicating the stability of our method. For p = 0.5, the sparsification in
GeomCA led to an artificial increase in scores, while PI, RI ≈0.7 did not detect the differences
in the sets potentially due to the additional downsampling. While the average GeomCA scores
obtained without sparsification are more aligned with DCA, they exhibit large std due to the unstable
ε estimation. Similar conclusions hold for p = 0.75 and p = 0.999, where both GeomCA and sparse
GeomCA scores are lower than DCA due to a largely disconnected graph resulting from a small ε.
The IPR was again not robust for p = 0.75, while in p = 0.999, PI exhibited larger mean and std
compared to other scores indicating the erroneous merges originating from large radii of the outliers.
Lastly, downsampling of E negatively affected RI resulting in a low score. In Appendix B.1, we
also report the results for GS which we found to be inadequaltely informative."

bution learned by a StyleGAN model trained on the FFHQ dataset and individual generated images."
EVALUATION OF A STYLEGAN,0.3155339805825243,"Generation capacity To evaluate generation capabilities of StyleGAN, we repeated the truncation
experiment performed in (Kynk¨a¨anniemi et al., 2019; Poklukar et al., 2021) where during testing
latent vectors were sampled from a normal distribution truncated with a parameter ψ affecting the
perceptual quality and variation of the generated images. A lower ψ results in improved quality
of individual images but at the cost of reducing the overall generation variety. For each trunca-
tion ψ ∈{0.0, 0.1, . . . , 1.0}, we randomly sampled 50000 training images and generated 50000
images, and encoded them into a VGG16 model pretrained on ImageNet. The corresponding 4096-
dimensional representations composed the sets R and E, respectively. For low values of ψ, we
expect to obtain high precision values as the high-quality generated images should be embedded
close to the (fraction of) training images but low recall values as the former poorly cover the diver-
sity of the training images. Due to the large number of considered representations, we reduced the
size of the approximated Delaunay graph GD(R ∪E) by setting the sphere coverage parameter B,
introduced in Section 3.2, to 0.7."
EVALUATION OF A STYLEGAN,0.32038834951456313,"Figure 6 shows the obtained DCA scores (solid lines) together with GeomCA, IPR and GS scores
(dashed lines). All methods correctly reflect the truncation level ψ apart from GS at ψ = 0 and DCA
at ψ = 0.5, which we discuss in detail below. Firstly, DCA scores exhibit larger absolute values of
P, R compared to the benchmarks. Even though this is expected because Delaunay edges naturally
connect more points, we additionally investigated the average length of homogeneous edges among
R and among E points to verify the correctness of the obtained scores. In Table 7, we observe
that the average length homogeneous edges among E increases with increasing ψ and resembles the
average length homogeneous edges among R for ψ = 1.0. This indicates that the StyleGAN model"
EVALUATION OF A STYLEGAN,0.32524271844660196,"was successfully trained, which is on par with the high-quality images reported by Karras et al.
(2019). However, both GeomCA and IPR methods result in more conservative values which are
especially visible for recall. For GeomCA, this is because ε is estimated from R resulting in fewer
and smaller components (also due to the sparsification), which in turn yields low PsG, RsG. For
IPR, it is because the radii of spheres around E points yield a conservative coverage as discussed in
Section 2. Therefore, this analysis demonstrates that DCA scores in this case provide more accurate
description of the geometry."

EVALUATION OF A STYLEGAN,0.33495145631067963,"Next, we analyze the in-
consistency in R and E de-
tected by DCA at ψ
=
0.5. It originates from their
peculiar geometric position
similar to that visualized in
Figure 2, where points in
E formed a denser cluster
that was slightly mixed but
mostly concatenated to a
more scattered cluster in R.
As discussed in Section 2,
such formation can neither
be detected by IPR due to
the large sphere radii ob-
tained from the more scat-
tered R points nor Ge-
omCA due to the sparsi-
fication removing majority
of dense E points that are
concatenated to the R cluster, while a single score of GS is too uninformative. In Appendix B.2,
we provide a detailed investigation where we both analyzed the lengths of edges in MST(GD) and
applied DCA to R and E sets obtained at different truncation levels. The obtained results verify the
irregular formation of the points and highlight ineffectiveness of existing methods in such scenarios."
EVALUATION OF A STYLEGAN,0.33980582524271846,"Lastly, note that network consistency c and quality q values are reversed in DCA compared to Ge-
omCA as we consider all 50000 points. Therefore, we trivially obtained c equal to 1 that is perfectly
aligned with qsG score due to the geometric sparsification (see Appendix B). On contrary, q in-

EVALUATION OF A STYLEGAN,0.3446601941747573,"Quality of individual generated images A challenging problem in generative modelling is to as-
sess the quality of individual generated samples, which is possible with our q-DCA extension by
analyzing the shortest edges of their corresponding representations added to an existing G."
EVALUATION OF A STYLEGAN,0.34951456310679613,"To demonstrate this, we again created R from representations of randomly sampled 50000 train-
ing images, approximated G = GDD(R) and analyzed newly added edges EN(q) for each query
representation q corresponding to 1000 generated images. In Figure 7, we visualize examples of
generated images with shortest (left) and largest (right) inserted edges. We observe that the length
of the inserted edges correlates well with the visual quality of generated images, where generated
images close to the training ones display clear faces (left) and those further away display distorted
ones (right). We compared our results with the realism score (RS) introduced by Kynk¨a¨anniemi
et al. (2019) and sorted the generated images both by increasing Delaunay edge length and decreas-
ing RS and computed the intersection of first and last 100 samples. We obtained that 51% and 83%
of images are commonly marked as high and low quality, respectively, by both methods. Following
the discussion in Section 2, we emphasize that RS is highly affected both by outliers and uneven
distribution of points in R, which the authors address by discarding half of the hyperspheres with
the largest radii. Such adjustments are not robust to various arrangements or small perturbations of
points, and are not needed in case of Delaunay graphs."

classification model pretrained on ImageNet reflects the human labeling. By repeating the experi-
ment investigating separability of classes performed by Poklukar et al. (2021), we reached a similar
conclusion that VGG16 moderately separates semantic content (see Appendix B.3). However, we
further investigated whether the limited class separation originates from inadequacies of the model
or human labeling inconsistencies. To distinguish between the two scenarios, we applied q-DCA to
obtain labels of query points and compared them to their true labels."

EVALUATION OF A STYLEGAN,0.38349514563106796,"Amending labelling inconsistencies We used representations
of ImageNet images constructed by Poklukar et al. (2021)
corresponding to 5 classes representing kitchen utilities and
5 classes representing dogs. We constructed R by randomly
sampling 10000 points, and composed the query set Q1 of the
remaining 2758 points. We then determined the label of each
query point q by the label of its closest point in its neighbour-
hood N(q). The obtained 87.6% accuracy offers interesting
insights into both human labeling and structure of the VGG16
representation space. In Figure 8, we show various examples
of query images (left) and the corresponding closest image in
GDD (right) having different labels. The first row shows ex-
amples of pairs of images considered close by VGG16 despite
no clear semantic connection between them. The second row
shows examples having meaningfully different labels but are
encoded close by VGG16 potentially due to the similar pat-
tern. On the other hand, the last row shows examples where
human labeling is different but VGG16 correctly encoded the
images close due to their striking semantic similarity. More
examples can be found in Appendix B.3, where we show similar cases using images correspond-
ing to randomly chosen classes also considered by Poklukar et al. (2021). The results suggest that
a more reliable labeling could result from a combination of human input and the ability of neural
networks to recognize semantic similarity in images."

CONCLUSION,0.3932038834951456,"We presented Delaunay Component Analysis (DCA) framework for evaluation of learned data repre-
sentations which compares the structure of two sets of representations R and E using the introduced

regions. Thus, while HDBSCAN obtains the minimum spanning tree MST from the mutual reach-
ability distance matrix, we obtain it directly from GD. From MST, HDBSCAN then extracts the
dendrogram representing the hierarchy of connected components, which is further simplified into a
condensed tree. The latter is obtained by categorizing each split in the dendrogram either as a real
split, if there is more than minimum cluster size mcs points in each branch, or as outlying points
otherwise. Lastly, by analyzing the distances associated to the birth and death of the clusters in the
condensed tree, HDBSCAN extracts flat clusters with longest lifetime. Therefore, with our modi-
fication of HDBSCAN, DCA inherits only one hyperparameter mcs, which is intuitive to tune. In
Appendix B.1, we show that our obtained distilled Delaunay graph GDD and DCA scores are stable
with respect to the choice of mcs. In all our experiments we used mcs = 10."

graph G = GDD(R ∪E) and Q2 further away. Moreover, if the model is robust to the semantic

several Gf although these vary in their length. Therefore, we considered only those inserted edges
whose length were representative of the connected components they connected to, i.e, we calculated
the mean µ(EGf ) and std σ(EGf ) of the length of edges in each Gf ∈F and kept only edges from
N(qj) ∩Gf that were shorter than µ(EGf ) + σ(EGf ). We refer to these edges as typical edges
and define two assignment procedures: (1) conservative where we assigned qj to a component Gf
only if all typical edges connected qj to exactly one Gf and did not assign it to any otherwise, and
(2) flexible where we additionally assigned qj, whose typical edges connected to more than one

likely due to the small radius of the constructed hyperspheres arising from a small distance between
representations of the same class (as discussed in Section 2). We observe that GS (multiplied by

reduces the number of edges and hence improves the memory consumption (see middle rows in
Table 5) at the cost of slightly increasing the total computational time (column total). Thirdly, we
see that in Ab-3) increasing T naturally increases the time necessary for the approximation of GD
and consequentially the time needed to distill GD and analyze GDD. For clarity, we report the
actual elapsed time in seconds for columns distill GD and analyse GDD because of the potentially
misleading percentage obtained from the large normalization constant (column total)."

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION OF STYLEGAN"
REFERENCES,0.8689320388349514,"In this section, we present a detailed investigation of the geometry of R and E points obtained
in Section 4.2 as well as an additional ablation study on the hyperparameters of the DCA method
similar to the one carried out in Section B.1."
REFERENCES,0.8737864077669902,"Investigation of the geometry of R and E points obtained in Section 4.2 Firstly, we additionally
verified the correctness of the obtained DCA scores for each truncation level ψ by investigating the
average length of homogeneous edges among R and among E points. The results including mean
and standard deviation of the lengths are reported in Table 7. We observe that the average length
homogeneous edges among E increases with increasing ψ and resembles the average length of the
homogeneous edges among R for ψ = 1.0. This analysis suggests that the StyleGAN model was
successfully trained, which is supported by the high-quality images reported in (Karras et al., 2019),
and indicates the correctness of the obtained DCA values."
REFERENCES,0.8786407766990292,"Next, we performed a series of further experiments to investigate the decrease in our DCA scores
obtained at truncation level ψ = 0.5 shown in Figure 6. Firstly, we analysed whether the decrease
emerged from irregularities of points in R or points in E. To this end, we performed two more tests
and applied DCA on the sets a) R = R(ψ = 0.4) and E = R(ψ = 0.5) and b) R = R(ψ = 0.4)
and E = E(ψ = 0.5), where we denoted by, e.g., R(ψ = 0.4), the set R obtained at truncation
level ψ = 0.4 in Section 4.2. In a), we obtained that P = 0.98, R = 0.98 and q = 0.55 indicating
no irregularities in the set R(ψ = 0.5) of sampled training image representations, while in b) we
obtained P = 0.52, R = 0.05 and q = 0.14, which is equally low as for R = R(ψ = 0.5) and
E = E(ψ = 0.5) where P = 0.65, R = 0.10 and q = 0.19 (as visualized in Figure 6). This
analysis showed that the irregularity originates from the geometry of the set E(ψ = 0.5)."
REFERENCES,0.883495145631068,"Next, in order to verify that R and E were formed in a specific geometric arragenment similar to that
depicted in Figure 2, we additionally analyzed the minimum spanning tree MST(GD) obtained from
the approximated Delaunay graph GD built on the sets R = R(ψ = 0.5) and E = E(ψ = 0.5).
Recall that MST(GD) is a subgraph of GD connecting all the vertices such that the total edge length
is minimized and there exist no cycles. The latter implies that an MST of a graph with n vertices
contains n −1 edges. If our hypothesis that R and E have different densities and are concatenated
with a minor intersection is correct, this should be reflected in the length of the edges in MST(GD).
We calculated the average length and standard deviation of both homogeneous (among points from
only one of the sets) and heterogeneous edges (among points from R and E) in MST(GD). We
obtained the average length of homogeneous edges 21.58 ± 4.88 among R and 13.78 ± 3.29 among
E points, while for heterogeneous edges the length resulted in 18.19 ± 4.00. This indicates the
differences in the density of points in each of the set. Moreover, homogeneous edges among R and
E points represented 33% and 49% of all edges, respectively, while heterogeneous edges accounted
only for the remaining 18%. Together with the obtained low network quality q = 0.19 showing that
R and E are poorly geometrically mixed, this verifies that points from R and E are concatenated as
shown in Figure 2. Moreover, when performing geometric sparsification on R = R(ψ = 0.5) and
E = E(ψ = 0.5), which resulted in |R| = 9364 and |E| = 576, we obtained P = 0.77, R = 0.43
and q = 0.16, which artificially improved the DCA scores with a minor decrease in q compared to
results obtained in Figure 6. We emphasise that this scenario cannot be detected with the existing
methods due to their limitations discussed in Section 2."

see that all non-trivial E components in both versions consist of individual dog breeds suggesting
that features representing dogs might be easier for the network to distinguish."

scores are affected by the sparsification process, while ours reflect the structure of the original sets
R and E, ii) their absolute values of P, R and |G0|r

result of lower number of edges obtained in GeomCA. For example, the ratio of the number of edges
