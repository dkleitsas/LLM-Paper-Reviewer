ABSTRACT,0.002976190476190476,"Deep Generative Networks (DGNs) are extensively employed in Generative Ad-
versarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and their variants
to approximate the data manifold and distribution. However, training samples are
often distributed non-uniformly on the manifold, due to the cost or convenience
of collection. For example, the CelebA dataset contains a large fraction of smiling
faces. These inconsistencies will be reproduced when sampling from the trained
DGN, which is not always preferred, e.g., for fairness or data augmentation. In
response, we develop MaGNET, a novel and theoretically motivated latent space
sampler for any pre-trained DGN that produces samples uniformly distributed on
the learned manifold. We perform a range of experiments on several datasets and
DGNs, e.g., for the state-of-the-art StyleGAN2 trained on the FFHQ dataset, uni-
form sampling via MaGNET increases distribution precision by 4.1% and recall
by 3.0% and decreases gender bias by 41.2%, without requiring labels or retrain-
ing. Since uniform sample distribution does not imply uniform semantic distri-
bution, we also explore how semantic attributes of generated samples vary under
MaGNET sampling. Colab and codes at bit.ly/magnet-sampling"

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01488095238095238,"Deep Generative Networks (DGNs) are Deep Networks (DNs) trained to learn latent representations
of datasets; such frameworks include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al.,
2014), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2013), ﬂow-based models such as
NICE (Dinh et al., 2014), and their variants (Dziugaite et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2016; Durugkar et al.,
2017; Arjovsky et al., 2017; Mao et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019; Fabius & van Amersfoort, 2014;
van den Oord et al., 2017; Higgins et al., 2017; Tomczak & Welling, 2017; Davidson et al., 2018;
Dinh et al., 2017; Grathwohl et al., 2018; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018). A common assumption that
we will carry through our study is that the datasets of interest are not uniformly distributed in their
ambient space, but rather are concentrated on, or around, manifolds of lower intrinsic dimension,
e.g., the manifold of natural images (Peyr´e, 2009). Different DGN training methods have been
developed and reﬁned to obtain models that approximate as closely as possible the training set
distribution. This becomes an Achilles heel when the training set, regardless of its size, is not
representative of the true data distribution, i.e., when the training samples have been curated based
on cost or availability that result in implicit/explicit biases. In such scenarios, while the training
samples will lie on the true data manifold, the density distribution of the training set will be different
from the natural distribution of the data."
INTRODUCTION,0.017857142857142856,"Deploying a DGN trained with a biased data distribution can be catastrophic, in particular, when
employed for tasks such as data augmentation (Sandfort et al., 2019), controlled data generation for
exploration/interpretation (Thirumuruganathan et al., 2020), or estimation of statistical quantities
of the data geometry, such as the Lipschitz constant of the data manifold (Gulrajani et al., 2017;
Scaman & Virmaux, 2018). Biased data generation from DGNs due to skewed training distributions
also raises serious concerns in terms of fair machine learning (Hwang et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.020833333333333332,"While ensuring semantic uniformity in samples is an extremely challenging task, we take one step
in the more reachable goal of controlling the DGN sampling distribution to be uniform in terms of
the sample distribution on the data manifold. To that end, we propose MaGNET (for Maximum
entropy Generative NETwork), a simple and efﬁcient modiﬁcation to any DGN that adapts its latent
space distribution to provably produce samples uniformly distributed on the learned DGN manifold.
Importantly, MaGNET can be employed on any pre-trained and differentiable DGN regardless of its
training setting, reducing the requirement of ﬁne-tuning or retraining of the DGN. This is crucial
as many models, such as BigGAN (Brock et al., 2019) and StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2020), have
signiﬁcant computational and energy requirements for training. A plug-and-play method is thus
greatly preferred to ease deployment in any already built/trained deep learning pipeline."
INTRODUCTION,0.023809523809523808,"Previously, there has been rigorous work on DGNs aimed at improving the training stability of mod-
els, deriving theoretical approximation results, understanding the role of the DGN architectures,
and numerical approximations to speed-up training and deployment of trained models (Mao et al.,
2017; Chen et al., 2018; Arjovsky & Bottou; Miyato et al., 2018; Xu & Durrett, 2018; Liu et al.,

Berg et al., 2018). Existing methods (Metz et al., 2016; Tanaka, 2019; Che et al., 2020) also try to
tackle mode dropping by improving approximation of the data distribution, but this can potentially
increase the bias learned implicitly by the DGN. We are the ﬁrst to consider the task of providing
uniform sampling on the DGN underlying manifold, which has far-reaching consequences, rang-
ing from producing DGNs stable to data curation and capable of handling inconsistencies such as
repeated samples in the training set. We provide a ﬁrst-of-its-kind provable uniform sampling on
the data manifold that can be used to speed up estimation of various geometric quantities, such as
estimation of the Lipschitz constant."

BACKGROUND,0.03869047619047619,"2
BACKGROUND
Continuous Piecewise Afﬁne (CPA) Mappings. A rich class of functions emerges from piecewise
polynomials: spline operators. In short, given a partition Ωof a domain RS, a spline of order k is
a mapping deﬁned by a polynomial of order k on each region ω ∈Ωwith continuity constraints on
the entire domain for the derivatives of order 0,...,k −1. As we will focus on afﬁne splines (k = 1),
we only deﬁne this case for concreteness. An afﬁne spline S produces its output via"

BACKGROUND,0.047619047619047616,"with input z and Aω, bω the per-region slope and offset parameters respectively, with the key
constraint that the entire mapping is continuous over the domain S ∈C0(RS). Spline operators
and especially afﬁne spline operators have been extensively used in function approximation theory

Deep Generative Networks.
A deep generative network (DGN) is a (nonlinear) operator GΘ
with parameters Θ mapping a latent input z ∈RS to an observation x ∈RD by composing L
intermediate layer mappings. The only assumption we require for our study is that the nonlinearities
present in the DGN are CPA, as is the case with (leaky-)ReLU, absolute value, max-pooling. For
smooth nonlinearities, our results hold from a ﬁrst-order Taylor approximation argument. Precise
deﬁnitions of DGN operators can be found in Goodfellow et al. (2016). We will omit Θ from
the GΘ operator for conciseness unless needed.
It is also common to refer to z as the latent
representation, and x as the generated/observed data, e.g., a time-series or image. One property
of DGNs that employ nonlinearities such as (leaky-)ReLU, max-pooling, and the likes, is that the
entire input-output mapping becomes a CPA spline."

the learned underlying manifold. Hence, our solution produces a generative process that becomes
invariant to the training set distribution. While this provides a theoretical guarantee for uniform
sampling, it also highlights the main limitation of MaGNET: the uniform samples will lie on a
CPA manifold. That is, unless the true manifold M is also continuous, MaGNET will occasionally
introduce abnormal samples that correspond to sampling from the regions of discontinuity of M.
We will see in the following sections how even on high-quality image datasets, MaGNET produces
very few abnormal samples, one reason being that for complicated data manifolds, state-of-the-art
DGNs are often built with (class) conditioning. In such cases, the above continuity assumption on
M lessens only to a within-class continuity assumption which is much more realistic. Sampling
uniformly on the DGN manifold has many important applications that are deferred to the following

UNIFORM SAMPLING ON THE DEEP GENERATIVE NETWORK MANIFOLD,0.19642857142857142,"First, we consider MNIST and assume that the entire data manifold is approximately covered by
the training samples. Regardless of the training data distribution on the manifold (uniform or not),
we can pick a datum at random, count how many generated samples (η) are within this datum ϵ-
ball neighborhood and repeat this process for 10,000 training samples. If η does not vary between
training datum, then it strongly indicates that the generated samples are uniformly distributed on
the manifold covered by the training data. We perform this experiment using a pretrained state-of-
the-art variational autoencoder NVAE (Vahdat & Kautz, 2020) to compare between standard and
MaGNET sampling with the number of generated samples N ranging from 1,000 to 10,000. We
report the distribution of η in Fig. 3. Again, uniform sampling is equivalent to having the same η for
all training samples, i.e., a Dirac distribution in the reported histograms. We can see that MaGNET
sampling approaches that distribution while standard sampling has a heavy-tail η distribution, i.e.,
the generated digits have different concentrations at different parts of the data manifold. Another
quantitative measure consists of ﬁtting a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with varying number of
clusters, on the generated data, and comparing the likelihood obtained for standard and MaGNET
sampling. As we know that in both cases the samples lie on the same manifold and domain, the sam-
pling with lower likelihood will correspond to the one for which samples are spread more uniformly
on the manifold. We report this in Fig. 4, further conﬁrming the ability of MaGNET to produce
uniformly spread samples. We report the generated samples in Appendix E. Lastly, we compare
the Fr´echet Inception Distance (FID) (Heusel et al., 2017) between 50,000 generated samples and
70,000 training samples for StyleGAN2 (conﬁg-f) trained on FFHQ. Since uniform sampling via
MaGNET increases the diversity of generated samples, we see that MaGNET sampling improves

pendix F). While for the aforementioned ψ MaGNET samples alone provide an improved FID, for
higher ψ values, we introduce an increasing amount of MaGNET samples for FID calculation. We
observe in Fig. 4 that by progressively increasing the percentage of MaGNET samples, we are able
to exceed the state-of-the-art FID of 2.74 for StyleGAN2 (ψ = 1), reaching an FID of 2.66 with

Uniform Face Generation:
CelebA-HQ and Flickr-Faces-HQ with progGAN and Style-

pretrained on the Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ) dataset. StyleGAN2 has two DGNs, one that maps to
an intermediate latent space, termed style-space and another DGN that maps style-space vectors
to the pixels-space (output of StyleGAN2). Implementation details are contained in Appendix H.
We focus here on applying MaGNET onto the entire StyleGAN2 model (the composition of both
DGNs), in Sec. 4.4 we discuss applying MaGNET to the style-space DGN. In Fig. 1 we provide
random samples from the same StyleGAN2 model obtained via standard and MaGNET sampling.
Upon qualitative evaluation, it can be seen that the samples obtained via MaGNET (MaGNET Style-
GAN2) have a signiﬁcantly larger variety of age distribution, background variations and wearable"

For experiments with the CelebA-HQ dataset, we adopt the Progressively Growing GAN (prog-
GAN) (Karras et al., 2017), trained on 1024 × 1024 resolution images. In Fig. 9 we provide random
samples from standard and MaGNET sampling, the latter portraying more qualitative diversity. We
see that uniform manifold sampling via MaGNET recovers samples containing a number of at-
tributes that are generally underrepresented in the samples generated by vanilla progGAN. (See Ap-
pendix E for larger batches and attribute distributions.) Note that uniform sampling not only recovers
under-represented groups e.g., age < 30, head-wear, and bald hair, it also increases the presence of
neutral emotion and black hair. One interesting observation is that MaGNET also increases the
number of samples off the true data manifold (images that are not celebrity faces), exposing regions
where the manifold is not well approximated by progGAN.
Conditionally Uniform Generation: ImageNet with BigGAN. We present experiments on the
state-of-the-art conditional generative model BigGAN (Brock et al., 2019) using MaGNET sam-
pling. In Fig. 7 we provide random samples from standard and MaGNET sampling. More ex-
periments on different classes are presented in Appendix E. We see that uniform sampling on the
learned data manifold yields a large span of backgrounds and textures, including humans, while
standard sampling produces examples closer to the modes of the training dataset. This is quite un-
derstandable considering that ImageNet was curated using a large number of images scraped from
the internet. MaGNET therefore could be used for data exploration/model interpretation and also as
a diagnostic tool to assess the quality of the learned manifold a posteriori of training."

APPLICATION: MONTE-CARLO ESTIMATION AND ATTRIBUTE REBALANCING
We conclude this section with two more practical aspects of MaGNET.
Reduced-Variance Monte-Carlo Estimator. The ﬁrst is to speed-up (in terms of number of re-
quired samples) basic Monte-Carlo estimation of arbitrary topological quantities of the generated
manifold. Suppose that one’s goal is to estimate the Lipschitz constant of a DGN. A direct estima-
tion method would use the known bound given by maxz ∥JS(z)∥F (Wood & Zhang, 1996). This
estimation can be done by repeatedly sampling latent vectors z from the same distribution that one
used for training a DGN. However, this implies that the produced samples will not be uniformly dis-
tributed on the manifold in turn leading to slower convergence of the estimator. Instead, we propose
to use MaGNET, and report our ﬁndings in Fig. 8. More domains of application, where MaGNET"

Style-space MaGNET sampling rebalances attributes. When thinking of uniform sampling on a
manifold, it might seem natural to expect fairness i.e., fair representation of different attributes such
as equal representation of gender, ethnicity, hair color, etc. However, this is not necessarily true
in all cases. In fact, it is trivial to show that each attribute category will be equally represented iff
their support on the true data manifold is of equal volume (integrated with respect to the data man-
ifold). Fortunately, as we mentioned in Sec. 4.3, architectures such as StyleGAN2 have explicitly
built a style-space, which is a latent space in which attributes are organized along afﬁne subspaces
occupying similar volumes (Karras et al., 2019) i.e., MaGNET applied on the style-space DGN
should improve fairness. By applying MaGNET sampling on the style-space, we are able to reduce
gender bias from 67–33% (female-male) in standard StyleGAN2 to 60–40%. This simple result
demonstrates the importance of our proposed sampling and how it can be used to increase fairness
for DGNs trained on biased training sets. MaGNET in the style-space also yields improvements
in terms of recall and precision (Sajjadi et al., 2018). Given a reference distribution (e.g., FFHQ
dataset) and a learned distribution, precision measures the ﬁdelity of generated samples while recall
measures diversity. We compare the metrics for face images generated via z ∼N(0, aI) where
a ∈0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, z ∼U[−2, 2], and MaGNET sampling on style-space. For 70k samples generated
for each case, MaGNET sampling obtains a recall and precision of (0.822, 0.92) with a 4.12% rela-
tive increase in recall and 3.01% relative increase in precision compared to the other latent sampling
methods (metrics were averaged for 10 seeds)."

CONCLUSIONS, LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We have demonstrated how the afﬁne spline formulation of DGN provides new theoretical results to
provably provide uniform sampling on the manifold learned by a DGN. This allows becoming robust
to possibly incorrect training set distributions that any DGN would learn to replicate after its train-
ing. We have reported on several experiments using pretrained state-of-the-art generative models
and demonstrated that uniform sampling on the manifold offers many beneﬁts from data exploration
to statistical estimation. Beyond the sole goal of uniform sampling on a manifold, MaGNET opens
many avenues, yet MaGNET is not a “one size ﬁts all” solution.
When not to sample uniformly. We can identify the general cases in which one should not em-
ploy uniform sampling of the DGN manifold. The ﬁrst case occurs whenever the true manifold is
known to be discontinuous and one needs to avoid sampling in those regions of discontinuities. In
fact, in the discontinuous case, DGN training will adapt to put zero (or near zero) density in those
discontinuous regions preventing standard sampling to reach those regions (Balestriero et al., 2020).
However, MaGNET will reverse this process and introduce samples back in those regions. The
second case occurs if one aims to produce samples from the same distribution as the training set
distribution (assuming training of the DGN was successful). In this scenario, one should use the
same latent distribution at evaluation time as the one used during training.
Future work. Currently, there are two main limitations of our MaGNET sampling strategy. The
ﬁrst one lies in the assumption that the trained DGN is able to learn a good enough approximation
of the true underlying data manifold. In future work, we plan to explore how MaGNET can be
used to test such an assumption. One potential direction is as follows; train a DGN using several
sub-sampled datasets (similar to bootstrap methods) and then study if MaGNET samples populate
manifolds that all coincide between the different DGNs. If training is successful, then those sam-
pled manifolds should coincide. Another direction could be understanding the relationship between
uniform sampling and uniform attribute representation. We demonstrated how uniform sampling in
the style-space of StyleGAN2 ensures that relationship by construction."

The CPA spline interpretation enabled from a MASO formulation of DGNs provides a powerful
global geometric interpretation of the network mapping based on a partition of its input space RS
into polyhedral regions and a per-region afﬁne transformation producing the network output. The
partition regions are built up over the layers via a subdivision process and are closely related to
Voronoi and power diagrams (Balestriero et al., 2019). We now propose to greatly extend such
insights to carefully characterize and understand DGNs as well as provide theoretical justiﬁcations

millions. However, we conducted an experiment to see how the number of samples really impacted
the uniformity of the generated manifold as follows. We compute precision and recall metrics [4]
for StyleGAN2 with K generated samples obtained from N Monte Carlo samples based on our
sampling strategy by varying N. We use K = 5000 and N ranging from 10,000 to 500,000. Based
on the metrics, we identify that increasing beyond K = 250, 000 no longer impacts the metrics,
showing that this number of monte carlo samples is enough to converge (approximately) to the
uniform sampling in that case; see Fig. 10."

memory and 576 Tensor cores. For the software details we refer the reader to the provided codebase.
In short, we employed TF2 (2.4 at the time of writing), all the usual Python scientiﬁc libraries such
as NumPy and PyTorch. We employed the ofﬁcial repositories of the various models we employed
with ofﬁcial pre-trained weights. As a note, most of the architectures can not be run on GPUs with
less or equal to 12 GB of memory."

iﬁed. We use the recommended default of ψ = 0.5 as the interpolating stylespace truncation, to
ensure generation quality of faces for the qualitative experiments. For BigGAN we use the BigGAN-
deep architecture with no truncation, available on TFHub2. We also use the NVAE3 and ProgGAN4
models and weights from their respective ofﬁcial implementations. For the Jacobian determinant
calculation of images w.r.t latents, we ﬁrst use a random orthogonal matrix to project generated im-
ages into a lower dimensional space, calculate the Jacobian of the projection w.r.t the latents and
calculate the singular values of the jacobian to estimate the volume scalar. We use a projection of
256 dimensions for StyleGAN2-pixel, ProgGAN and BigGAN, and 128 dimensions for NVAE. To
estimate the volume scalar we use the top 30, 20, 15 singular values for StyleGAN2 MaGNET pixel,
ProgGAN and BigGAN; 40 for StyleGAN2 MaGNET style, and 30 for NVAE."

PROOF OF LEMMA 1"
"STANDARD
-",0.8125,"Proof. In the special case of an afﬁne transform of the coordinate given by the matrix A ∈RD×D the
well known result from demonstrates that the change of volume is given by | det(A)| (see Theorem
7.26 in Rudin (2006)). However in our case the mapping is a rectangular matrix as we span an afﬁne
subspace in the ambient space RD making | det(A)| not deﬁned."
"STANDARD
-",0.8154761904761905,"First, we shall note that in the case of a Riemannian manifold (as is the produced surface from the
per-region afﬁne mapping) the volume form used in the usual change of variable formula can be
deﬁned via the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Now, for a surface of intrin-
sic dimension n embedded in Euclidean space of dimension m (in our case, the per-region afﬁne
mapping produces an afﬁne subspace) parametrized by the mapping M : Rn 7→Rm (in our case
this mapping is simply the afﬁne mapping M(z) = zωz + bω for each region) the metric tensor is
given by g = DM T DM with D the jacobian/differential operator (in our case g = AT
ωAω for each
region). This result is also known as Sard’s theorem (Spivak, 2018). We thus obtain that the change
of volume from the region ω to the afﬁne subspace G(ω) is given by

PROOF OF THM. 2
Proof. As we assume successful training, then regardless of the actual distribution px, the DGN will
learn the correct underlying manifold, and learn the best approximation to px as possible onto this
manifold. Now, applying MaGNET sampling i.e. Sec. 3.2 is equivalent to sampling from a distri-
bution pmz such that after DGN mapping, that distribution is uniform on the learned manifold (see
Thm. 1). As we assumed that regardless of px the DGN approximates correctly the true manifold,
and as we then adapt the sampling distribution pmz to always obtain uniform sampling on that man-
ifold, we see that this ﬁnal sampling becomes invariant upon the data distribution (on the manifold)
leading to the desired result."
