ABSTRACT,0.002004008016032064,"Neural networks for machine learning applications often yield to weight pruning
resulting in a sparse subnetwork that is adequate for a given task. Retraining these
‘lottery ticket’ subnetworks from their initialization minimizes the computational
burden while preserving the test set accuracy of the original network. The exist-
ing literature only confirms that pruning is needed and it can be achieved up to
a certain sparsity. We analyze the pruned network in the context of the proper-
ties of Ramanujan expander graphs. We consider the feed-forward network (both
multi-layer perceptron and convolutional network) as a series of bipartite graphs
which establish the connection from input to output. Now, as the fraction of re-
maining weights reduce with increasingly aggressive pruning, distinct regimes are
observed: initially, no significant decrease in accuracy is demonstrated, and then
the accuracy starts dropping rapidly. We empirically show that in the first regime,
the pruned lottery ticket sub-network remains a Ramanujan graph. Subsequently,
with the loss of Ramanujan graph property, accuracy begins to reduce sharply.
This characterizes an absence of resilient connectivity in the pruned sub-network.
We also propose a modified iterative pruning algorithm which removes edges in
only the layers that are Ramanujan graphs thus preserving global connectivity
even for heavily pruned networks. We perform experiments on MNIST and CI-
FAR10 datasets using different established feed-forward architectures to support
the criteria for obtaining the winning ticket using the proposed algorithm."

INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK"
INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK,0.006012024048096192,"Neural Network (NN) and its recent advancements have made a significant contribution to solve var-
ious machine learning applications. The power of an over-parameterized NN lies in its capability
to learn simple patterns and memorize the noise in the data (Neyshabur et al., 2018). However, the
training of such networks requires enormous computational resources, and often the deployment
onto low-resource environments such as mobile devices, or embedded systems becomes difficult.
Recent trend in research to reduce training time of deep neural networks has shifted towards pre-
training following the introduction of a remarkable contribution, named the Lottery Ticket Hypothe-
sis (LTH), which hypothesize the existence of a highly sparse subnetwork and weight initialization to
reduce the training resources as well (Frankle & Carbin, 2019). It uses a simple iterative, magnitude-
based pruning algorithm, and empirically shows that even after removing approximately 90% of the
weights, the subnetwork can preserve the original generalization error. In the subsequent studies, the
focus goes on finding this lottery ticket for more competitive tasks by pruning with weight rewind-
ing(Frankle et al., 2019a), fine tuning the learning rates (Renda et al., 2020), more efficient training
(You et al., 2019; Brix et al., 2020; Girish et al., 2021)."
INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK,0.008016032064128256,"Neural network pruning involves sparsification of the network (LeCun et al., 1990; Blalock et al.,
2020). It identifies the weight parameters, removal of which incurs minimal effect on the general-
ization error. There exists different categories of pruning based on (i) how the pruning is performed,
for instance based on the weight magnitude (Han et al., 2015; Zhu & Gupta, 2017), gradient in the
backpropagation, hessian of the weight (Hassibi et al., 1993; Dong et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018), etc;
(ii) whether the pruning is global or local; (iii) how often pruning should be applied like one-shot
Lee et al. (2018); Wang et al. (2020), iterative Tanaka et al. (2020). One of the primary goals in
the literature has been to reduce the computational footprint at the time of prediction, i.e., during
post-training. In recent LTH studies, the victim weights are determined by their value at the ini-"

INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK,0.012024048096192385,"tialization, gradient of the error, and network topology Lee et al. (2019); Tanaka et al. (2020). To
understand weight initialization, Malach et al. (2020) show that pruning makes a stronger hypoth-
esis with bounded weight distribution. The sparsity of the network is reduced from polynomial to
a logarithmic factor of the number of training variables (Orseau et al., 2020). Mocanu et al. (2018)
suggest to consider the topology of the network from a network science point of view. The pruning
algorithm starts from a random Erd˝os R´enyi graph and returns a scale-free network of a high sparsity
factor based on the number of neurons in each layer. The method is further evolved for convolution
layers considering both the magnitude and gradient of the weights(Evci et al., 2020a)."
INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK,0.014028056112224449,"Various analysis for explaining the LTH have been attempted in the past. Researchers Evci et al.
(2020b) explain empirically why the LTH works through gradient flow at different stages of the
training. Despite previous attempts to explain why the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis works, the under-
lying phenomenon associated with the hypothesis still remains ill-understood. All of these studies
related to LTH identify that a sparse sub-network can be trained instead of a complete network and
the network needs to be connected from input to output layers. However, none of them try to explain
the LTH and the properties of the pruned network through the lens of spectral graph theory. The
network connectivity can be described from the graph expansion point of view, where any subset of
vertices of size less than or equal to half of the number of vertices in a graph, is adjacent to at least
a fraction of the number of vertices in that set; for details, see (Lubotzky, 2010). Graphs satisfying
this property are known as expander graphs. The Ramanujan Graph is a special graph in a bounded
degree expander family, where the eigenbound is maximal (Nilli, 1991). This leads to a maximum
possible sparsity of a network while preserving the connectivity."
INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK,0.01603206412825651,"In this paper, we initiate a study to observe the characteristics of a pruned sub-network from the
spectral properties of its adjacency matrix, which, has not been reported previously. We represent
a feed-forward neural network as a series of connected bipartite graphs. Both weighted and un-
weighted bi-adjacency matrices are considered. The Ramanujan graph properties of each of the
bipartite layers are studied. We use the results of Hoory (2005) on the bound of spectral gap for the
weight matrix of a pruned network. It is empirically observed that existence of winning tickets in a
pruned network is dependent on the Ramanujan graph properties of the bipartite layers. As network
sparsity increases with more aggressive pruning, we obtain regions where test set accuracy do not
decrease much and the bipartite layers satisfy Ramanujan graph property. Subsequently we obtain
regions where the Ramanujan graph properties are lost for all the layers and test accuracy decreases
sharply. Also, we observe that the impact of noise in the data, on test set accuracy is more adverse
when some of the layers lose their Ramanujan graph properties. Experimental results are presented
for the Lenet architecture on the MNIST dataset and the Conv4 architecture on the CIFAR10 dataset.
Results for other popular feed-forward network are presented in the Appendix."
INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK,0.018036072144288578,"We suggest that preservation of Ramanujan graph properties may benefit existing network pruning
algorithms. We propose a modified pruning algorithm that uses the spectral bounds. The algorithm
identifies network layers that may still be pruned further, while avoiding pruning in layers that have
already lost their Ramanujan graph property. Neural network weight score functions suggested by
various pruning algorithms are used to represent the bipartite layers as weighted graphs. Spectral
bounds for these graphs are used to verify the Ramanujan property. For a number of popular pruning
algorithms, we experimentally demonstrate significant improvement in accuracy for sparse networks
by using these connectivity criteria.
Contributions: The contributions of the paper are the followings:
1. We propose a methodology for analyzing winning lottery tickets with respect to their spectral
properties.
2. We empirically observe that winning lottery tickets often satisfy layerwise bipartite Ramanu-
jan graph property representing a sparse but resiliently connected global network. The property is
checked using spectral bounds that generalize to irregular networks. We also notice better noise ro-
bustness when all the layers of the pruned sparse networks preserve the Ramanujan graph property.
3. Based on the above property we propose a modified iterative network pruning algorithm that
attempts to preserve Ramanujan graph property for all the layers even at low network densities. It
identifies layers that are still amenable to pruning while avoiding further pruning in layers that have
lost their Ramanujan graph property. We report significant performance improvement for a number
of popular pruning algorithms modified using this criteria."

THE LOTTERY TICKET HYPOTHESIS AND NETWORK PRUNING"
THE LOTTERY TICKET HYPOTHESIS AND NETWORK PRUNING,0.02404809619238477,"The lottery ticket hypothesis states that a randomly initialized, dense neural network contains a
subnetwork which when trained independently using the same initialization achieves a test accuracy
close to the original network after training for less or at most the same number of iterations Frankle
& Carbin (2019). These subnetworks, denoted as ‘winning tickets’, can be uncovered by network
pruning algorithms. Weight pruning is one such simple strategy. Let the original dense network be
represented as the function N(x; θ), where x is the input and θ are the weights. The weights have
an initialization of θ0. Weight pruning generates a mask m ∈{0, 1}|θ| such that the pruned network
can be represented by N(x; m ⊙θ) with initialization m ⊙θ0."
THE LOTTERY TICKET HYPOTHESIS AND NETWORK PRUNING,0.026052104208416832,"Pruning algorithms that are used to obtain the winning tickets can be either one-shot or iterative.
In one-shot pruning the original network is trained to convergence, then p% of weights are pruned
and the surviving weights are re-initialized to their values in θ0 followed retraining/fine tuning the
subnetwork. Here, the network training and pruning are not simultaneously performed and pruning
occurs only after convergence is reached. Iterative pruning repeats one-shot pruning over several
iteration. This often leads to higher pruning percentage while retaining test set accuracy. However,
iterative pruning is more time consuming than one-shot pruning. After pruning the surviving weights
may alternately be initialized to their values in θi, i denoting a small iteration number, rather than
their initial values in θ0. This process, as illustrated in Figure 1 (Frankle et al., 2019b), is denoted as
rewinding and is effective for large networks. We adopt this in our study."

case of weighted graphs, we need to modify the definition of the edge set of the graph to incorporate
multiple (as well as fractional) edges. The theory of characterisation of weighted Ramanujan graphs
is not well developed. However, characterisation of weighted expanders (with positive weights)
exist, due to the Cheeger inequality for such graphs, see (Chung, 1996, sec. 5) and we use the
largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix in place of the regularity. In the case of regular graphs,
it coincides with the notion of Ramanujan graphs and even in the general case, by the Cheeger

RAMANUJAN GRAPH PROPERTY PRESERVING PRUNING ALGORITHM,0.16633266533066132,"In this section, we describe a modification of the iterative pruning algorithm that preserves the
Ramanujan graph property of a pruned neural network. In iterative pruning algorithms, pruning is
employed once the training is complete (i.e. after it converged to an optimum or it reached certain
epochs). The pruned network is trained again with its initial weight values to perform the next
pruning iteration. The magnitude of a score function θ is used to identify the victim weights. The
weights are made to zero if their score function values lie in the bottom p percentile. In the Iterative
Magnitude Pruning (IMP) Frankle & Carbin (2019), magnitude of the weight is used as the score
function. More sophisticated score functions are used in SynFlow (Tanaka et al., 2020), SNIP (Lee
et al., 2018)."

the bipartite graph t2 = t(G), i.e., (i) eb- based on the largest eigenvalue(t1) and (ii) db- based on
the average degree (davgL and davgR). Here, G for a bipartite neural network layer Ni is either the

is mainly driven by the pruning level K, the number of input and output neurons at each layer, and
the number of layers. The additional space will be required to store the bipartite graph of a layer.

The existence of LTH regime is illustrated for two representative established networks. The results

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.25851703406813625,"Comparison of pruning approaches
We show that consideration Ramanujan graph properties
benefits network pruning algorithms. We consider three popular network pruning algorithms - (i)
Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) Frankle & Carbin (2019), (ii) the iterative verion of Single-
shot Network Pruning based on Connection Sensitivity (SNIP) Lee et al. (2018), (iii) Synaptic flow
based pruning SynFlow Tanaka et al. (2020) and show the results of test accuracy achieved with
similar densities with and without the bound condition. To do this experimentation, we choose the
a fix compression ratio α to achieve the desired density of the pruned network as 10−α × 100, and
observe the difference in accuracy due to the network connectivity. The results are presented in
Table 2 for Lenet/MNIST and Conv4/CIFAR10. For each of the algorithm we consider two cases
- (i) the network is pruned to very low densities using existing algorithms, (ii) network pruning is
stopped when there is loss of Ramanujan graph properties (#AlgoName-Bound). The bounds are
considered as two types of bounds - first it tries to maintain the bounds on the unweighted graph.
Next, if the unweighted graph looses the Ramanujan property it tries to preserve the information flow
by considering the spectral bounds for the weighted graphs with score function. We use layer-wise
pruning for all the algorithms."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.2605210420841683,"Here, adding the bound criteria guides the pruning algorithm to stop at a density where the accuracy
is comparable with its original network. These values are marked in bold in Table 2. The high-
est improvement is achieved by SynFlow algorithm for the Lenet architecture on MNIST dataset.
While the usual SynFlow algorithm results in an accuracy of 49.11% at the density of 1.0, the
SynFlow-Bound algorithm has an accuracy of 93.82% for a network density of 1.33. For the Conv4
architecture on CIFAR10, the scope of improvement using the bound criteria is limited since the
existing algorithms preserve the unweighted graph connectivity property for most of the layers. We
have also studied the spectral properties of all the layers the results are presented in the Appendix."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.2625250501002004,"We can also observe the difference of an arbitrary non-expander graph with an expander one of
similar density. As an example, we see the result for Conv4/CIFAR10. With density of 3.16 the IMP
achieves accuracy of 60.61% while SynFlow meets 77.18% accuracy. By analyzing the detail it has
been found that the Ramanujan property is lost in FC layer-1 only for SynFlow where the same is
observed in IMP for both Conv Layer-4 and FC layer-1. Hence, IMP loses more Ramanujan graph
property as a whole in the entire network."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.2665330661322645,"In this work, we study the validity of the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) based on structural con-
nectivity properties of the neural network. Ramanujan graph properties of the bipartite layers are
studied in terms of certain spectral bounds. As test accuracy varies with decreasing network density
as a result of pruning, three distinct regions are demarcated using these bounds. In the first region,
all the bipartite layers are Ramanujan graphs, in the second region some of them are, and in the third
low network density regions none of the layers are Ramanujan graphs. We empirically demonstrate
the validity of the lottery ticket hypothesis robustly in the first region and partially in the second re-
gion. We propose a modification of existing iterative pruning algorithms that preserves Ramanujan
graph property. Further refinement of this approach of pruning can result in more efficient winning
ticket search, which will be the basis of future research."
