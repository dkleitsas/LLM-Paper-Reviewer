ABSTRACT,0.004016064257028112,"Video prediction is an important yet challenging problem; burdened with the tasks
of generating future frames and learning environment dynamics. Recently, autore-
gressive latent video models have proved to be a powerful video prediction tool,
by separating the video prediction into two sub-problems: pre-training an im-
age generator model, followed by learning an autoregressive prediction model in
the latent space of the image generator. However, successfully generating high-
ﬁdelity and high-resolution videos has yet to be seen. In this work, we investigate
how to train an autoregressive latent video prediction model capable of predicting
high-ﬁdelity future frames with minimal modiﬁcation to existing models, and pro-
duce high-resolution (256x256) videos. Speciﬁcally, we scale up prior models by
employing a high-ﬁdelity image generator (VQ-GAN) with a causal transformer
model, and introduce additional techniques of top-k sampling and data augmen-
tation to further improve video prediction quality. Despite the simplicity, the pro-
posed method achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches on
standard video prediction benchmarks with fewer parameters, and enables high-
resolution video prediction on complex and large-scale datasets. Videos are avail-
able at the anonymized website https://sites.google.com/view/harp-anonymous."

are video sequences with high-resolution (Castrejon et al., 2019; Villegas et al., 2019; Clark et al.,

at both tasks of generating high-ﬁdelity images and learning the dynamics of environments, though
each task itself is already a very challenging problem."
INTRODUCTION,0.028112449799196786,"Recently, autoregressive latent video prediction methods (Rakhimov et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021)
have been proposed to improve the efﬁciency of video prediction, by separating video prediction
into two sub-problems: ﬁrst pre-training an image generator (e.g., VQ-VAE; Oord et al. 2017), and
then learning the autoregressive prediction model (Weissenborn et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020) in
the latent space of the pre-trained image generator. However, the prior works are limited in that
they only consider relatively low-resolution videos (up to 128 × 128 pixels) for demonstrating the
efﬁciency of the approach; it is questionable that such experiments can fully demonstrate the beneﬁt
of operating in the latent space of image generator instead of high-dimensional pixel-channel space."
INTRODUCTION,0.0321285140562249,"In this paper, we present High-ﬁdelity AutoRegressive latent video Prediction (HARP), which scales
up the previous autoregressive latent video prediction methods for high-ﬁdelity video prediction.
The main principle for the design of HARP is simplicity: we improve the video prediction quality
with minimal modiﬁcation to existing methods. First, for image generation, we employ a high-
ﬁdelity image generator, i.e., vector-quantized generative adversarial network (VQ-GAN; Esser et al.
2021). This improves video prediction by enabling high-ﬁdelity image generation (up to 256 × 256
pixels) on various video datasets. Then a causal transformer model (Chen et al., 2020), which
operates on top of discrete latent codes, is trained to predict the discrete codes from VQ-GAN,
and autoregressive predictions made by the transformer model are decoded into future frames at
inference time. Moreover, motivated by the sampling techniques widely-used in language generation
for making coherent and diverse predictions, we propose to utilize top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018)
that draws the next discrete code from the k-most probable codes. Since the number of discrete
codes the autoregressive model has to predict is very large, e.g., 6,400 codes on KITTI driving
dataset (Geiger et al., 2013), we ﬁnd that discarding rare discrete codes helps the model predict
diverse but high-quality videos, without any change to the training procedure."

2019) that extracts multi-scale hierarchical latents then train SNAIL blocks (Chen et al., 2018) that
predict hierarchical latent codes, enabling high-ﬁdelity video prediction. However, this involves a
complicated training pipeline and a video-speciﬁc architecture, which limits its applicability. As
simple alternatives, Rakhimov et al. (2021); Yan et al. (2021) proposed to ﬁrst learn a VQ-VAE

Similar to the motivation of Tian et al. (2021) that utilizes a pre-trained image generator in the
context of video synthesis, we ﬁrst pre-train the image generator then freeze the model throughout
training to improve the efﬁciency of learning video prediction models. The notable difference to a
prior work that utilize 3D convolutions to temporally downsample the video for efﬁciency (Yan et al.,
2021) is that our image generator operates on single images; hence our image generator solely focus
on improving the quality of generated images. Importantly, this enables us to utilize the VQ-GAN
model pre-trained on a wide range of natural images, e.g., ImageNet, without training the image
generator on the target datasets, which can signiﬁcantly reduce the training cost of high-resolution
video prediction model, Also, the representations from our video prediction model can be easily
transferred to downstream tasks that require ﬁne-grained control at each timestep, e.g., imitation

that top-k sampling improves video prediction quality, especially given that the number of discrete

high-resolution video prediction models on this dataset and fully exploit the beneﬁt of employing a
high-ﬁdelity image generator, we utilize the VQ-GAN model pre-trained on ImageNet dataset (Deng
et al., 2009). 2 As we only train the transformer model for video prediction, this enables us to train
a high-resolution video prediction model in a very efﬁcient manner. Speciﬁcally, we train the trans-
former model for 60,000 steps on training dataset, which takes less than a day using our machine.
As shown in Figure 5, our model can predict future frames on the test videos3, which demonstrates
that leveraging the large image generator pre-trained on a wide range of natural images can be a
promising recipe for efﬁcient video prediction on high-resolution, large-scale video datasets."

For quantitative evaluation, we ﬁrst consider the BAIR robot pushing dataset (Ebert
et al., 2017) consisting of roughly 40k training and 256 test videos. We consider action-free setup,
hence video prediction models should be stochastic for predicting the diverse possible movement
of a robot arm and objects. Following the setup in prior works (Clark et al., 2019; Weissenborn
et al., 2020; Luc et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2021), we predict 15 future frames conditioned on one
frame. We also evaluate our method on KITTI driving dataset (Geiger et al., 2013), where the
training and test datasets are split by following the setup in Lotter et al. (2017). As the KITTI
dataset is relatively small-scale compared to other datasets, i.e., 57 training videos, it provides a
good testbed for investigating the effect of data augmentation. For hyperparameters, we use k = 10
for both datasets and data augmentation with m = 4 is only applied to KITTI as there was no sign
of overﬁtting on BAIR dataset. For a fair comparison, we follow the setup of Villegas et al. (2019),
where (i) a model is trained to predict future ten frames conditioned on ﬁve frames and evaluated to
predict future 25 frames conditioned on ﬁve frames, and (ii) test dataset consists of 148 video clips
constructed by extracting 30-frame clips and skipping every 5 frames."

We use two evaluation metrics: Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS;
Zhang et al. 2018), a frame-wise metric designed to better represent the human perceptual simi-
larity of two frames compared to traditional metrics (Wang et al., 2004; Huynh-Thu & Ghanbari,
2008), and Fr`echet Video Distance (FVD; Unterthiner et al. 2018), a dynamics-based evaluation
metric known to be better correlated with the human evaluation compared to frame-wise evaluation
metrics. FVD is computed by comparing the summary statistics of I3D network trained on Kinetics-
400 dataset (Carreira & Zisserman, 2017), and LPIPS is computed using the features from AlexNet
(Krizhevsky et al., 2012). For comparison with the scores reported in prior works, we exactly follow
the evaluation setup in Villegas et al. (2019) and Babaeizadeh et al. (2021) that samples 100 future
videos for each ground-truth test video, then reports the best score over 100 videos for LPIPS, and
the score using all videos for FVD, with the batch size of 256 for BAIR and 148 for KITTI."
COMPARATIVE EVALUATION ON STANDARD BENCHMARKS,0.3895582329317269,"Results.
Table 1 shows the performances of our method and baselines on test sets of BAIR Robot
Pushing and KITTI driving dataset. We observe that our model achieves competitive or superior
performance to state-of-the-art methods with large end-to-end networks, e.g., HARP outperforms
FitVid with 302M parameters on KITTI driving dataset. Our model successfully extrapolates to un-
seen number of future frames (i.e., 25) instead of 10 future frames used in training on KITTI dataset.
This implies that transformer-based video prediction models can also predict arbitrary number of
frames at inference time. In the case of BAIR dataset, HARP achieves the similar performance of
FitVid with 302M parameters, even though our method only requires 89M parameters. We provide
videos predicted by HARP on BAIR and KITTI datasets in Appendix C."
COMPARATIVE EVALUATION ON STANDARD BENCHMARKS,0.39357429718875503,"Analysis.
We investigate how the top-k sampling, number of layers, and magnitude m of data
augmentation affect the performance. Table 2a shows that smaller k leads to better performance,
implying that the proposed top-k sampling is effective for improving the performance by discarding
rare discrete codes that might degrade the prediction quality at inference time. As shown in Ta-
ble 2b, we observe that more layers leads to better performance on BAIR dataset, which implies our
model can be further improved by scaling up the networks. Finally, we ﬁnd that (i) data augmen-
tation on KITTI dataset is important for achieving strong performance, similar to the observation
of Babaeizadeh et al. (2021), and (ii) too aggressive augmentation leads to worse performance. We
provide the learning curves with and without augmentation in Appendix B."

FINE-TUNING HARP FOR MULTI-TASK IMITATION LEARNING,0.41365461847389556,"Setup.
In order to demonstrate that the pre-trained representations from HARP can be useful for
solving downstream tasks, we evaluate the imitation learning performance of ﬁne-tuned HARP on
MT-50 benchmark from Meta-World. Speciﬁcally, we take the pre-trained HARP model (see Fig-
ure 3 for the video predictions from this model), and ﬁne-tune the model to predict expert actions
by introducing a policy network on top of the transformer model. For comparative evaluation, we
consider three baselines: (a) VQ-Transformer, which shares the same architecture with HARP but
trained from scratch, (b) CNN-LSTM, which extracts features using convolutional neural networks
(CNN) and LSTM networks, and (c) CNN-Transformer, that utilizes transformer networks instead
of LSTM networks. For training and evaluation, we use the same training and test dataset used for
video prediction experiments. We report the average success rate over 10 trials for each task. More
details are available in Appendix A."

We ﬁrst observe
that VQ-Transformer, which has a same architecture with
HARP but trained from scratch, completely fails to solve the
tasks. This shows the difﬁculty of training useful represen-
tations with ﬁxed discrete codes as inputs.
However, ﬁne-
tuned HARP model successfully outperforms other baselines
because pre-trained representations contain useful information
for long-term reasoning. This demonstrates that video predic-
tion with HARP can be an effective self-supervised learning
scheme for solving various control tasks."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.43775100401606426,"In this work, we present HARP, a high-ﬁdelity autoregressive latent video prediction model. By
employing a high-ﬁdelity image generator and utilizing top-k sampling at inference time, HARP
can predict high-resolution future frames, and achieve competitive performance to state-of-the-art
video prediction methods with large end-to-end networks. We also show that HARP can leverage
the image generator pre-trained on a wide range of natural images for video prediction, similar
to the approach in the context of video synthesis (Tian et al., 2021). We hope this work inspires
more investigation into leveraging a pre-trained image generator for video prediction, which can
signiﬁcantly reduce the cost for training a high-resolution video prediction model by building on the
recent success of high-ﬁdelity image generation (Oord et al., 2017; Razavi et al., 2019; Esser et al.,
2021; Child, 2020; Ho et al., 2020; Karras et al., 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021)."
DISCUSSION,0.44176706827309237,"Finally, we report the failure cases of video prediction with HARP and discuss the possible ex-
tensions to resolve the issue. A common failure case for video prediction on RoboNet dataset is
ignoring the interaction between a robot arm and objects. For example, in Figure 6a, our model
ignores the objects and only predicts the movement of a robot arm. On the other hand, common
failure case for Kinetics-600 is a degenerate video prediction, where a model just repeats the con-
ditioning frame without predicting the future, as shown in Figure 6b. These failure cases might be
resolved by training more larger networks similar to the observation in the ﬁeld of natural language
processing, e.g., GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), or might necessitate a new architecture for addressing
the complexity of training autoregressive latent prediction models on video datasets."

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF HARP"
REFERENCES,0.8032128514056225,"VQ-GAN.
The training of HARP consists of two-stages. First, for training a VQ-GAN model
(Esser et al., 2021) we use the publicly available source code from the authors13. Following the sug-
gestion of the authors, we trained a VQ-GAN model without a discriminator loss until it converges,
then resume the training with a discriminator loss for total {300000, 500000, 150000, 30000} train-
ing steps with batch size of {24, 24, 320, 96} on Meta-World, RoboNet, BAIR Robot Pushing,
and KITTI driving dataset, respectively. For Kinetics-600 dataset, we leverage the publicly avail-
able VQ-GAN model14 pre-trained on ImageNet without training a VQ-GAN model from scratch.
The size k of codebook C in (2) is {8192, 8192, 1024, 1024, 1024} for Meta-World, RoboNet,
Kinetics-600, BAIR Robot Pushing, and KITTI dataset, respectively."
REFERENCES,0.8072289156626506,"Causal transformer.
Then we train a 12-layer Sparse Transformers (Child et al., 2019) to predict
the discrete codes from VQ-GAN models in an autoregressive manner, by building on the publicly
available source code15 of VideoGPT (Yan et al., 2021). For conditioning on initial frames, we
utilize the same architecture as in Yan et al. (2021) that utilizes ResNet architecture to extract the
downsampled feature map. We utilize ResNet-18 architecture for all experiments. We train the
model until it converges on Meta-World, BAIR, and KITTI datasets, but we cannot ﬁnd the sign of
overﬁtting on large-scale datasets of RoboNet and Kinetics-600. Speciﬁcally, we train the model
for {50000, 80000, 100000, 85000, 30000} training steps on Meta-World, RoboNet, Kinetics-600,
BAIR Robot Pushing, and KITTI dataset, respectively. We use the data augmentation with the
magnitude of m = 4 on KITTI driving dataset, which has shown to be very effective for improving
the performance (see Appendix B) for a learning curve with and without augmentation)."
REFERENCES,0.8112449799196787,"Inference with top-k sampling.
We utilize top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018) to improve the video
prediction quality. For all datasets, we utilize k = 10. One major limitation of autoregressive
prediction model is slow inference time. We utilize the implementation of Yan et al. (2021) that
caches the previous key, values and utilize them for fast inference. In order to enable our model to
extrapolate to unseen length of frames at evaluation time on KITTI dataset (e.g., the model has to
predict 25 frames instead of 10 frames the model is trained to predict), we ﬁrst predict T frames
xc:T −1 conditioned on c initial frames x1:c, then predict the next frames by (a) keeping x1:c as
conditioning frames and (b) giving the predicted last T −1 frames as inputs to the causal transformer
model. We repeat this process until predicting all 25 future frames."

action embeddings with the same dimension of token em-
beddings, then add the action embeddings of time step
t + 1 to token embeddings used for predicting the tokens
of time step t + 1. At inference time, the inference pro-
cedure is exactly same as HARP except that future action
embedding is added to the token embedding. We ﬁnd that

causal transformer model. Speciﬁcally, we train a behavioral cloning policy to minimize the mean
squared error between the predicted actions from a layer and ground-truth expert actions. In order
to further improve the performance of all methods, we follow the idea of Dasari & Gupta (2020)
to learn a inverse dynamics predictor that predicts the action given two consecutive frames. We
train all methods for 20,000 steps with the batch size of 20 and data augmentation of magnitude
m = 4. For CNN-based methods, we use ResNet-50 for feature extractor, and use 4-layer LSTM16

EFFECTS OF AUGMENTATION"
REFERENCES,0.8473895582329317,"Figure 8 shows the test error during the training of HARP on KITTI driving dataset (Geiger et al.,
2013). One can see that the test error from a model trained without augmentation increases after
initial ∼2500 training steps, which is a sign of overﬁtting. However, we observe that the test error
from a model trained with data augmentation keeps decreasing throughout training until it converges,
which shows the effectiveness of data augmentation for learning video prediction models, similar to
the observation in Babaeizadeh et al. (2021). One notable detail here is that HARP overﬁts to KITTI
training dataset with much fewer number of parameters (i.e., 89M) when compared to FitVid that
utilizes 303M parameters."
