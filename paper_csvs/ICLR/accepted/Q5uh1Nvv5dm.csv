ABSTRACT,0.0010515247108307045,"We extend semi-supervised learning to the problem of domain adaptation to learn
signiﬁcantly higher-accuracy models that train on one data distribution and test
on a different one. With the goal of generality, we introduce AdaMatch, a uniﬁed
solution for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), semi-supervised learning
(SSL), and semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA). In an extensive experi-
mental study, we compare its behavior with respective state-of-the-art techniques
from SSL, SSDA, and UDA and ﬁnd that AdaMatch either matches or signiﬁcantly
exceeds the state-of-the-art in each case using the same hyper-parameters regard-
less of the dataset or task. For example, AdaMatch nearly doubles the accuracy
compared to that of the prior state-of-the-art on the UDA task for DomainNet and
even exceeds the accuracy of the prior state-of-the-art obtained with pre-training
by 6.4% when AdaMatch is trained completely from scratch. Furthermore, by
providing AdaMatch with just one labeled example per class from the target domain
(i.e., the SSDA setting), we increase the target accuracy by an additional 6.1%, and
with 5 labeled examples, by 13.6%.1"

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.0031545741324921135,"Since the inception of domain adaptation and knowledge transfer, researchers have been well aware of
various conﬁgurations of labeled or unlabeled data and assumptions on domain shift (Csurka, 2017).
Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), semi-supervised learning (SSL), and semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) all use different conﬁgurations of labeled and unlabeled data, with
the major distinction being that, unlike SSL, UDA and SSDA assume a domain shift between the
labeled and unlabeled data (see Table 1). However, currently the ﬁelds of SSL and UDA/SSDA are
fragmented: different techniques are developed in isolation for each setting, and there are only a
handful of algorithms that are evaluated on both (French et al., 2018)."
INTRODUCTION,0.004206098843322818,"Techniques that leverage unlabeled data are of utmost importance in practical applications of machine
learning because labeling data is expensive. It is also the case that in practice the available unlabeled
data will have a distribution shift. Addressing this distribution shift is necessary because neural
networks are not robust (Recht et al., 2019a; Biggio & Roli, 2018; Szegedy et al., 2013; Hendrycks
& Dietterich, 2019; Azulay & Weiss, 2018; Shankar et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2019; Taori et al., 2020)
to even slight differences between the training distribution and test distribution. Although there are
techniques to improve out-of-distribution robustness assuming no access to unlabeled data from the
target domain (Hendrycks et al., 2020; Zhang, 2019; Engstrom et al., 2019; Geirhos et al., 2018; Yang
et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019), it is common in practice to have access to unlabeled data in a shifted
domain (i.e. the UDA or SSDA setting), and leveraging this unlabeled data allows for much higher
accuracy. Moreover, while SSDA (Donahue et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2015; Ao et al., 2017; Saito et al.,
2019) has received less attention than both SSL and UDA, we believe it describes a realistic scenario
in practice and should be equally considered."
INTRODUCTION,0.005257623554153523,"In this work, we introduce AdaMatch, a uniﬁed solution designed to solve the tasks of UDA, SSL, and
SSDA using the same set of hyperparameters regardless of the dataset or task. AdaMatch extends
FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020) by (1) addressing the distribution shift between source and target
domains present in the batch norm statistics, (2) adjusting the pseudo-label conﬁdence threshold
on-the-ﬂy, and (3) using a modiﬁed version of distribution alignment from Berthelot et al. (2020)."

INTRODUCTION,0.011566771819137749,"AdaMatch sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 28.7% for UDA without pre-training and 33.4%
with pre-training on DomainNet, an increase of 11.1% when compared on the same code base. With
just one label per class on the target dataset, AdaMatch is more data efﬁcient than other method,
achieving a gain of 6.1% over UDA and 13.6% with 5 labels. We additionally promote democratic
research by reporting results on a smaller 64 × 64 DomainNet. This results in a minimal drop in
accuracy compared to the full resolution, and compared to the practice of sub-selecting dataset pairs,
does not bias the results towards easier or harder datasets. Finally, we perform an extensive ablation
analysis to understand the importance of each improvement and modiﬁcation that distinguishes
AdaMatch from prior semi-supervised learning methods."

RELATED WORK,0.013669821240799159,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). UDA studies the performance of models trained on a
labeled source domain and an unlabeled target domain with the goal of obtaining high accuracy
on the target domain. Inspired by the theoretical analysis of domain adaptation (Ben-David et al.,
2010), a major focus has been reducing the discrepancy of representations between domains, so that
a classiﬁer that is learned on the source features works well on the target features. UDA methods can
be categorized by the technique they use to measure this discrepancy. For example, (Long et al., 2013;
Tzeng et al., 2014; 2015) use the maximum mean discrepancy (Gretton et al., 2012), (Sun & Saenko,
2016) use correlation alignment across domains, and domain adversarial neural networks (Ajakan
et al., 2014; Ganin et al., 2016; Bousmalis et al., 2017; Saito et al., 2018) measure the domain
discrepancy using a discriminator network. Maximum classiﬁer discrepancy (Saito et al., 2018)
(MCD) measures the domain discrepancy via multiple task classiﬁers, achieving SOTA performance."
RELATED WORK,0.014721345951629864,"Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL). In SSL, a portion of the training dataset is labeled and the
remaining portion is unlabeled. SSL has seen great progress in recent years, including temporal
ensemble (Laine & Aila, 2017), mean teacher (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017), MixMatch (Berthelot
et al., 2019), ReMixMatch (Berthelot et al., 2020), FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020), and unsupervised
data augmentation (Xie et al., 2019). While there is no technical barrier to applying SSL to UDA, only
a few SSL methods have been applied to solve UDA problems; for example, on top of the discrepancy
reduction techniques of UDA, several works (French et al., 2018; Long et al., 2018; Saito et al., 2019;
Tran et al., 2019) propose to combine SSL techniques such as entropy minimization (Grandvalet &
Bengio, 2005) or pseudo-labeling (Lee, 2013). While NoisyStudent (Xie et al., 2020) uses labeled
data from ImageNet and unlabeled data from JFT in training, they do not leverage this distribution
shift during training, and they only evaluate on the source domain (i.e., ImageNet)."
RELATED WORK,0.015772870662460567,"Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) has been studied in several settings, including vi-
sion (Donahue et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2015; Ao et al., 2017; Saito et al., 2019) and natural language
processing (Jiang & Zhai, 2007; Daumé III et al., 2010; Guo & Xiao, 2012). Since SSDA assumes
access to labeled data from multiple domains, early works have used separate models for each
domain and regularized them with constraints (Donahue et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2015; Ao et al.,
2017; Daumé III et al., 2010; Guo & Xiao, 2012). However, such methods are difﬁcult to adapt to
the UDA setting where labeled data is only available in a single domain. One recent exception is
minimax entropy (MME) regularization (Saito et al., 2019), which can work in both the UDA and
SSDA setting. However, unlike AdaMatch, MME requires a pre-trained network to work well."
RELATED WORK,0.016824395373291272,"Transfer learning is used to boost accuracy on small datasets by initializing model parameters with
pre-trained weights ﬁrst learned on a separate, larger dataset, which can compensate for the limited
amount of labeled source data and boost the overall performance (Recht et al., 2019b; Kolesnikov

Ofﬁce-31 (Saenko et al., 2010), PACS (Li et al., 2017), and DomainNet (Peng et al., 2019), use
ImageNet-pretrained models to initialize model parameters. Though useful for some cases in practice,
it may not be the most general protocol to evaluate the advancement of UDA algorithms, especially

niques, aimed at solving UDA, SSL, and SSDA. As typical in SSL, AdaMatch takes both an unlabeled

ADAMATCH,0.03785488958990536,"Notation. We use capital letters X, Y , Z to denote minibatches of examples, labels and logits.
Speciﬁcally, XSL ⊂RnSL×d and YSL ⊂{0, 1}nSL×k denote the minibatch of source images and
labels, respectively. Similarly, the minibatch of unlabeled target images is XT U ⊂RnT U×d. Here, k
is the number of classes and d is the input dimension (for images d = h · w · c, where h is height, w
is width, and c is the number of channels). The minibatch size for the labeled data is nSL and the
minibatch size of the unlabeled images is nT U. Additionally, we use Y (i) to refer to its i-th row, and
Y (i,j) to refer to the i, j−th element of Y . The model f : Rd →Rk takes images as input and outputs
logits for each of k classes. Importantly, the source and target domain are the same classiﬁcation task,

METHOD DESCRIPTION"
METHOD DESCRIPTION,0.03995793901156677,"AdaMatch introduces three new techniques to account for differences between the source and target
distributions – random logit interpolation, a relative conﬁdence threshold, and a modiﬁed distribution
alignment from ReMixMatch (Berthelot et al., 2020) – but builds upon the algorithmic backbone
from FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020). We ﬁrst provide a high-level overview of the algorithm and then
discuss the implementation details of the various components. For a brief summary of how each
component helps with distribution shift and accompanying motivational examples, see Appendix A."
METHOD DESCRIPTION,0.04100946372239748,"Overview. A high-level depiction of AdaMatch is in Figure 1. Two augmentations are made for
each image: a weak and a strong one with the intent to make the class prediction harder on the
strongly augmented image2. Next, we obtain logits by running two batches through the model: a
batch of the source images and batch composed of both the source and target images. Each of the
resulting batches of logits are inﬂuenced by their respective batch norm statistics, i.e. the source
batch is only inﬂuenced by the source data batch norm statistics while the batch that combines source
and target is inﬂuenced by both domains batch norm statistics. Two loss terms are then computed:"
METHOD DESCRIPTION,0.04206098843322818,"• The source loss term is responsible for predicting correct source labels and for aligning
source and target logit domains. We ﬁrst combine logits for the source images using
random logit interpolation, which encourages the model to produce the same label for
the hyperspace connecting source logits obtained from 1) only source examples and 2) a
combination of source and target examples. In practice, this creates an implicit constraint
to align the source and target domains in logit space. The newly obtained source logits are
then used to compute the cross-entropy loss for the source data."
METHOD DESCRIPTION,0.04311251314405889,"2We use the general “weak” and “strong” terms because they can be dependent on the task. For all of our
results: Weak is shift and mirror about the x axis. Strong is weak augmentation plus the addition of cutout."

METHOD DESCRIPTION,0.0452155625657203,"• The target loss term is responsible for predicting the correct target labels and for aligning
the target predictions to a desired class distribution. Since we don’t assume access to labels
for the target images, we create a pseudo-label for these images as follows. First, we rectify
the class distribution obtained from weakly augmented target images to a desired class
distribution using distribution alignment. If the target class distribution is known, it can be
used directly. In the general case where it is not known, we use the source class distribution
instead. We then select entries of the batch for which the rectiﬁed probabilities of the
weakly augmented target image predictions are above a user-deﬁned conﬁdence threshold.
A pseudo label is then made for these outputs by selecting the most conﬁdent class, and
these pseudo-labels are used with a standard cross-entropy loss applied to the logits of the
strongly augmented images."
METHOD DESCRIPTION,0.046267087276550996,"Augmentation. For a dataset D ∈{SL, TU}, we augment each image batch XD fed into AdaMatch
twice, once with a weak augmentation and once with a strong augmentation, using the same types
of weak and strong augmentations as (Berthelot et al., 2020). This forms a pair of batches XD,w
and XD,s respectively, which we denote together as Xaug

normalization statistics are shared, and the second time we only pass the source label data. We
only update batch normalization statistics when computing {Z′

avoid double counting source labeled data. Note that without batch normalization, we would have

batch statistics from the source and target domains with the batch statistics from the source domain,
which has the effect of producing batch statistics that are more representative of both domains. More

SL, which can
be accomplished by either 1) having Z′
SL and Z′′
SL be equal to each other, or 2) having the whole
line between Z′
SL and Z′′
SL be a minima. Rather than picking one of the two ways, we formulate the
problem as minimizing the loss for all connecting points, which gives the model the freedom to ﬁnd
the best possible solution. The key point is that we randomly choose the interpolation value , and then
minimize the loss on this randomly interpolated value. Because we randomly choose the point on the
line each time, over the course of training we can ensure that the entire line segment between Z′
SL
and Z′′
SL reaches low loss. Another way to achieve the same result would be to divide the interval
into N (a large number) of different segments, and then minimize the loss on all N points. However
this would be computationally expensive and so by randomly choosing a new each time we achieve
the same result without increasing the computation cost by a factor of N."
METHOD DESCRIPTION,0.054679284963196635,"Distribution alignment. Distribution alignment (Berthelot et al., 2020) can be seen as an additional
form of model regularization that helps constrain the distribution of the class predictions to be more
aligned with the true distribution. Without it, the classiﬁer could just predict the most prevalent class
or exhibit other failure modes. Ideally, if the target label distribution is known, we would use it
directly. However, when the target label distribution is unknown, we approximate it using the only
available distribution – the source label distribution. A limitation of this approach is that the more the
source label distribution differs from the target distribution, the more incorrect the approximation will
be, which may cause the model performance to degrade. However, in practice, we ﬁnd that aligning
the target pseudo-labels to match the source label distribution helps signiﬁcantly."

EXTENSION TO SSL AND SSDA,0.08622502628811778,"SSDA differs from UDA by the presence of targeted labeled data XT L. AdaMatch can be used
without change by feeding the concatenated batch XST L = {XSL, XT L} in place of XSL. As in
SSL, the same trick works for other methods. Note there’s a subtle effect on the uratio which ends
up being implicitly halved since the labeled batch is twice bigger in SSDA than in standard UDA."

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP"
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.08832807570977919,"We evaluate AdaMatch on the SSL, UDA, and SSDA tasks using the standard DigitFive (Ganin et al.,
2016) and DomainNet (Peng et al., 2019) visual domain adaptation benchmarks and we compare
to various existing methods. DigitFive experiments and ablation studies were run on a single V100
GPU, other experiments were run on a single TPU."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.08937960042060988,"Datasets. Digit-Five is composed of 5 domains, USPS (Hull, 1994), MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998),
MNIST-M (Ganin et al., 2016), SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), and synthetic numbers (Ganin et al.,
2016). We resize all images into 32×323 and convert them to RGB. DomainNet (Peng et al., 2019) is
composed of six domains from 345 object categories. Unlike prior work (Ganin et al., 2016; Saito
et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2019), unless otherwise stated, we train models from scratch to focus on
evaluating the efﬁcacy of the algorithms themselves."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.0904311251314406,"Democratic research. For DomainNet, we experiment with two image resolutions, 64×64 and
224×224. Though Peng et al. (2019) only evaluate with resolution 224×224, we include 64×64
to make future experiments using DomainNet more accessible to researchers with limited compute
budget. Moreover, we ﬁnd that AdaMatch can outperform the previous SOTA for DomainNet at
224×224 resolution even when trained with 64×64 resolution images."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.0914826498422713,"Network and training hyperparameters. We use ResNetV2-101 (He et al., 2016) for resolution
224×224 , WRN-34-2 (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) for 64×64, and WRN-28-2 for 32×32.
We tried three conﬁdence thresholds (0.8, 0.9, 0.95) on 64×64 UDA clipart→infograph and picked
the best. Additionally, we picked the largest uratio allowed on 8 GPUs for a batch size of 64
using 224×224 images. We coarsely tuned (using 3 candidate values) the learning rate, learning
rate decay, and weight decay using only the 64×64 supervised source data. For weight decay, we
used a empirical rule: halving it for 32×32 neural networks and doubling it for the 224×224 to
coarsely adapt the regularization to the capacity of the network (we used a weight decay of 0.0005
for WRN-28-2, 0.001 for WRN-34-2 and 0.002 for ResNetV2-101). We set learning rate to 0.03 and

since it achieves SOTA performance on standard SSL benchmarks and our algorithm borrows many
components from it. We also include NoisyStudent since it is a popular approach to SSL that achieves
competitive results on large-scale datasets like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). Finally, we include our

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.138801261829653,"Machine learning models still suffer a drop in accuracy on out-of-distribution data. However, if we
have access to unlabeled data from a shifted domain (the UDA setting) or even a small amount of
labeled data from the shifted domain (the SSDA setting), we can greatly improve accuracy. In this
work, we present AdaMatch, a general method designed to boost accuracy on domain shifts when
given access to unlabeled data from the new domain. AdaMatch uniﬁes the domains of UDA, SSL,
and SSDA, demonstrating that one method can perform well at all three."
CONCLUSION,0.1398527865404837,"Overall, our work shows that it is possible to apply SSL algorithms out-of-the-box to the domain
adaptation problem. By taking into account the distribution shift, AdaMatch can signiﬁcantly
improve upon SSL methods. This suggests that a promising direction for future work is to take new
advances from SSL and translate or modify them for the domain adaptation setting. While AdaMatch
outperforms prior work by a large margin, there is still an even larger margin left for improvement on
out-of-distribution shifts. This leaves open an important question: which is more important for future
progress, making use of unlabeled data more efﬁciently, or attempting to better model domain shifts?"

a limited amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The development of data
efﬁcient ML algorithms are of utmost importance in democratization of ML methods. However, the
conﬁrmation bias of self-training (Arazo et al., 2019) could be a concern for building a fair ML model

but more in-depth investigation on the fairness and robustness of data-efﬁcient ML algorithms should

MOTIVATION AND ILLUSTRATING EXAMPLES"

they help with distribution shift:"
RANDOM LOGIT HAS THE EFFECT OF PRODUCING BATCH STATISTICS THAT ARE MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF BOTH,0.21871713985278654,"1. Random logit has the effect of producing batch statistics that are more representative of both
domains (Section 3.1: Random Logit Interpolation) and creates an implicit constraint to
align the source and target domains in logit space (Section 3.1: Overview)."
DISTRIBUTION ALIGNMENT HELPS CONSTRAIN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE CLASS PREDICTIONS TO BE MORE,0.21976866456361724,"2. Distribution alignment helps constrain the distribution of the class predictions to be more
aligned with the true distribution (Section 3.1: Distribution Alignment). If we left it out, then
the model would have no incentive to match the target distribution to the source distribution."
DISTRIBUTION ALIGNMENT HELPS CONSTRAIN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE CLASS PREDICTIONS TO BE MORE,0.22082018927444794,"3. Relative conﬁdence thresholding addresses the issue that models are poorly calibrated on
out-of-distribution data. (Section 3.1: Relative Conﬁdence Threshold) By including relative
conﬁdence thresholding, we can ensure that the target data is used as pseudo labels as often
as it should be."

follow a frequency distribution of {0.4, 0.6}, e.g. 40% of samples are from class 1 and 60% from
class 2. Let’s say the model for the weakly augmented source data currently predicts an empirical
frequency distribution of {0.3, 0.7}, e.g. 30% for class 1 and 70% for class 2. However, for the
weakly augmented target data the model predicts on average {0.6, 0.4}."

of making the ﬁrst class of PT U,w half as likely and the second class (roughly) twice as likely. In
other words, it changes the class distribution on the weakly augmented unlabeled target domain from
{0.6, 0.4} to {0.3, 0.7}."
DISTRIBUTION ALIGNMENT HELPS CONSTRAIN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE CLASS PREDICTIONS TO BE MORE,0.22607781282860148,"Relative conﬁdence thresholding example: Conﬁdence thresholding determines what is a conﬁdent
pseudo-label for unlabeled data. However, since machine learning models are poorly calibrated (Guo
et al., 2017), especially on out-of-distribution data, the conﬁdence varies from dataset to dataset
depending on the ability of the model to learn its task."

data. Using a default conﬁdence threshold of τ = 0.9 for pseudo-labels will exclude almost all
unlabeled data since they are unlikely to exceed the maximum labeled data conﬁdence. In this
scenario, relative conﬁdence thresholding is particularly useful. By multiplying the default conﬁdence
threshold τ by the average top-1 labeled conﬁdence, we can obtain a relative conﬁdence ratio of
cτ = 0.9 × 0.7 = 0.63 which is more likely to capture a meaningful fraction of the unlabeled data."

1.0. When the average top-1 conﬁdence on the labeled data is 1.0, the relative conﬁdence threshold
cτ and the default conﬁdence threshold τ are the same. Therefore, one can see relative conﬁdence
thresholding as a generalization of the conﬁdence thresholding concept."
