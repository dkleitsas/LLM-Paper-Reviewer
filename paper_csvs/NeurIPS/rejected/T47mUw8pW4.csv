Introduction
10"
INTRODUCTION,0.02522935779816514,"In [19], Federer introduced the reach of a (closed) set S ⊂Rd as the infimum over all points in S of
11"
INTRODUCTION,0.027522935779816515,"the distance from these points to the medial axis ax(S), the set of points in Rd for which the closest
12"
INTRODUCTION,0.02981651376146789,"point in S is not unique. Federer also introduced the reach at a point p ∈S to be the distance from p
13"
INTRODUCTION,0.03211009174311927,"to the medial axis of S. We now call this quantity the local feature size [3] and denote it by lfs(p).
14"
INTRODUCTION,0.034403669724770644,"Federer proved that the reach is stable under C1,1 diffeomorphisms of the ambient space. Here, a
15"
INTRODUCTION,0.03669724770642202,"C1,1 map is a C1 map whose derivative is Lipschitz, and a C1,1 diffeomorphism is a C1,1 bijective

17"
INTRODUCTION,0.04128440366972477,"respect to the Hausdorff distance under ambient diffeomorphisms, but under stronger assumptions
18"

19"
INTRODUCTION,0.045871559633027525,"morphism of the ambient space. Chazal and Soufflet based their work on earlier results by Blaschke
20"
INTRODUCTION,0.0481651376146789,"[9], which were not as strong as Federer’s.
21"
INTRODUCTION,0.05045871559633028,"In this paper we extend the stability result of the medial axis. More concretely, we generalize the
22"
INTRODUCTION,0.052752293577981654,"result of Chazal and Soufflet [13] to arbitrary closed sets and C1,1 diffeomorphisms of the ambient
23"
INTRODUCTION,0.05504587155963303,"space; we show that the Hausdorff distance between the medial axes of the closed set and its image is
24"
INTRODUCTION,0.05733944954128441,"bounded in terms of Lipschitz constants stemming from the diffeomorphism of the ambient space.
25"
INTRODUCTION,0.05963302752293578,"Our result follows from the work of Federer [19] and in fact shortens the proof in [13] significantly.
26"
INTRODUCTION,0.06192660550458716,"Our bounds on the Hausdorff distance say nothing about the topology of the medial axis, which is
27"
INTRODUCTION,0.06422018348623854,"known to be highly unstable (see e.g. [5]), although it preserves the homotopy type (see [28]).
28"
INTRODUCTION,0.06651376146788991,"Contribution and related work
Our work differs from the majority of the literature in three
29"
INTRODUCTION,0.06880733944954129,"essential ways:
30"
INTRODUCTION,0.07110091743119266,"Firstly, we make no assumptions on the set we consider apart from that it is closed. The stability of
31"
INTRODUCTION,0.07339449541284404,"the medial axis of (piecewise) smooth manifolds has been the object of intense study, see for example
32"
INTRODUCTION,0.07568807339449542,"[13, 15–17, 24, 30, 37–40]. However, the manifold assumption is impossible to achieve in many
33"
INTRODUCTION,0.0779816513761468,"applications — such as in the context of astrophysics, one of the main motivations of this paper.
34"
INTRODUCTION,0.08027522935779817,"Secondly, we achieve stability without pruning the medial axis. This contrasts with a large body of
35"
INTRODUCTION,0.08256880733944955,"work, such as [6, 12, 16, 29]. Not having to prune the medial axis is a significant advantage. On the
36"
INTRODUCTION,0.08486238532110092,"downside, we limit the changes of the considered set to those induced by ambient diffeomorphisms.
37"
INTRODUCTION,0.0871559633027523,"Nevertheless, given the standard examples of the instability of the medial axis — see for example [5]
38"
INTRODUCTION,0.08944954128440367,"— we believe these limitations are near to the weakest assumptions necessary for Hausdorff stability.
39"
INTRODUCTION,0.09174311926605505,"Within the context of ambient homeomorphisms, the results we obtain are close to optimal, as we
40"
INTRODUCTION,0.09403669724770643,"specify in Remark 4.2.
41"
INTRODUCTION,0.0963302752293578,"Thirdly, our results hold for sets in arbitrary dimensions and are not sensitive to the dimension of the
42"
INTRODUCTION,0.09862385321100918,"set itself. A large part of the related work only investigates sets of low dimensions or codimension
43"
INTRODUCTION,0.10091743119266056,"one manifolds, although there are some notable exceptions such as [39], see also [17], and [12, 29].
44"
INTRODUCTION,0.10321100917431193,"Motivation
The medial axis has many real world applications — among others, in robot motion
45"
INTRODUCTION,0.10550458715596331,"planning [27], triangulation algorithms [4], graphics [35], and shape recognition, segmentation, and
46"
INTRODUCTION,0.10779816513761468,"learning [10, 18, 25, 33, 41]. See also the overviews [32, 35]. The reach — the distance between a
47"
INTRODUCTION,0.11009174311926606,"set and its medial axis — is a central concept in manifold learning [1, 2, 20–22, 34].
48"
INTRODUCTION,0.11238532110091744,"The motivation of this paper is twofold: Firstly, we tackle the following challenge from the processing
49"
INTRODUCTION,0.11467889908256881,"of images collected with optical devices which use lenses — such as cameras or telescopes. A shape
50"
INTRODUCTION,0.11697247706422019,"extracted from such an image may be imprecise due to the imperfection of the lenses. Our result
51"
INTRODUCTION,0.11926605504587157,"implies that the medial axis of such a shape is stable under these imperfections. As a consequence,
52"
INTRODUCTION,0.12155963302752294,"the outcome of any shape recognition or shape segmentation algorithm based on the medial axis will
53"
INTRODUCTION,0.12385321100917432,"be stable.
54"
INTRODUCTION,0.12614678899082568,"In addition to the disciplines listed above, such stability is sought after in astrophysics, in particular
55"
INTRODUCTION,0.12844036697247707,"for shape analysis and automated shape identification in observational astronomy. Observational
56"
INTRODUCTION,0.13073394495412843,"astronomers are interested in reconstructing objects like stars or galaxies, and their place in the
57"
INTRODUCTION,0.13302752293577982,"universe from data gathered by telescopes. They can deduce the distance from the object to the
58"
INTRODUCTION,0.1353211009174312,"observer thanks to so-called standard candles or red shift [14, 23, 31]. However, the image gets
59"
INTRODUCTION,0.13761467889908258,"distorted due to optical effects — either through gravitational lensing ([7]) or lensing inside the
60"
INTRODUCTION,0.13990825688073394,"telescope itself ([36]).
61"
INTRODUCTION,0.14220183486238533,"Such a distortion can be modeled as a diffeomorphism of the ambient space. At the same time, this
62"
INTRODUCTION,0.1444954128440367,"problem cannot be tackled using the result by Chazal and Soufflet [13], since the observed objects
63"
INTRODUCTION,0.14678899082568808,"might not be smooth — for example due to interactions with shock waves or jets. In addition, with
64"
INTRODUCTION,0.14908256880733944,"our method astrophysicists can not only reconstruct objects in space (3D), but also in spacetime (4D).
65"
INTRODUCTION,0.15137614678899083,"The second motivation is more formal in nature: The stability of the medial axis is instrumental in
66"
INTRODUCTION,0.1536697247706422,"establishing its computability. Indeed, when proving properties of algorithms based on the medial
67"
INTRODUCTION,0.1559633027522936,"axis, authors generally assume the real RAM model.1 However, as was recently argued in [29], the
68"
INTRODUCTION,0.15825688073394495,"medial axis needs to be stable in order to be computable in more realistic models of computation.
69"
INTRODUCTION,0.16055045871559634,"There is a more practical component to this formal question: It is not a priori clear if using possibly
70"
INTRODUCTION,0.1628440366972477,"noisy real world data or the output of other computer programs as input for these algorithms yields
71"
INTRODUCTION,0.1651376146788991,"answers that are close to the ground truth. To be able to prove that the output is correct, we need

73"
INTRODUCTION,0.16972477064220184,"Outline
After revisiting preliminaries and known results in Section 2, we state the main stability
74"
INTRODUCTION,0.1720183486238532,"result in Section 3. In Section 4 we reformulate this result in terms of norms on Banach spaces. This
75"
INTRODUCTION,0.1743119266055046,"also exhibits the fact that the stability of the medial axis is Lipschitz in the following sense: We think
76"
INTRODUCTION,0.17660550458715596,"of the set S as fixed and consider the map from the space of diffeomorphisms (endowed with a norm
77"
INTRODUCTION,0.17889908256880735,"which makes it a Banach space) to the space of closed subsets of Rd (endowed with the Hausdorff
78"

79"
INTRODUCTION,0.1834862385321101,"The Lipschitz constant then only depends on the diameter of the bounding sphere of the set S.
