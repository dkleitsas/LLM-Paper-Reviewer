ABSTRACT,0.0,"ABSTRACT
We propose a minimax formulation for removing backdoors from a given poi-
soned model based on a small set of clean data. This formulation encompasses
much of prior work on backdoor removal. We propose the Implicit Backdoor
Adversarial Unlearning (I-BAU) algorithm to solve the minimax. Unlike previous
work, which breaks down the minimax into separate inner and outer problems, our
algorithm utilizes the implicit hypergradient to account for the interdependence
between inner and outer optimization. We theoretically analyze its convergence
and the generalizability of the robustness gained by solving minimax on clean
data to unseen test data. In our evaluation, we compare I-BAU with six state-of-
art backdoor defenses on eleven backdoor attacks over two datasets and various
attack settings, including the common setting where the attacker targets one class
as well as important but underexplored settings where multiple classes are tar-
geted. I-BAU’s performance is comparable to and most often signiﬁcantly better
than the best baseline. Particularly, its performance is more robust to the variation
on triggers, attack settings, poison ratio, and clean data size. Moreover, I-BAU
requires less computation to take effect; particularly, it is more than 13× faster
than the most efﬁcient baseline in the single-target attack setting. Furthermore, it
can remain effective in the extreme case where the defender can only access 100
clean samples—a setting where all the baselines fail to produce acceptable results."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.0037593984962406013,"In backdoor attacks, adversaries aim to embed predeﬁned triggers into a model during training time
such that a test example, when patched with the trigger, is misclassiﬁed into a target class. For
instance, it has been shown that one could use a sticker as the trigger to mislead a road sign classiﬁer
to identify STOP signs to speed limit signs (Gu et al., 2017). Such attacks pose a great challenge to
deploy machine learning in mission-critical applications (Li et al., 2020c; 2021a)."
INTRODUCTION,0.005639097744360902,"Various approaches have been proposed to remove the effect of backdoor attacks from a poisoned
model. One popular class of approaches (Wang et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2019)
is to ﬁrst synthesize the trigger patterns from the model and then unlearn the triggers. However,
these approaches presume that backdoor triggers only target a small portion of classes, thereby
becoming ineffective when many classes are targeted by the attacker. Moreover, they suffer from
high computational costs, as they either require synthesizing the trigger for each class independently
or training additional models to synthesize the triggers all at once. Another line of works does not
rely on trigger synthesis; instead, it directly mitigates the triggers’ effects via, for example, ﬁne-
tuning and pruning the model parameters (Liu et al., 2018a) and preprocessing the model input (Qiu
et al., 2021). While these approaches are more efﬁcient than the trigger-synthesis-based approaches,
they cannot maintain a good balance between robustness and model accuracy due to the unawareness
of potential triggers. Recent work (Li et al., 2020b) proposes to leverage a teacher model to guide
ﬁne-tuning. However, our empirical studies ﬁnd that the effectiveness of this approach is particularly
sensitive to the underlying attack and data augmentation techniques utilized to enrich the ﬁne-tuning
dataset. Overall, it remains a challenge to design a defense that achieves a good balance between
model accuracy, robustness, and computational efﬁciency."

We conduct a thorough empirical evaluation of I-BAU by comparing it with six state-of-art backdoor
defenses on seven backdoor attacks over two datasets and various attack settings, including the com-

RELATED WORK"
INTRODUCTION,0.015037593984962405,"Backdoor Attacks. Backdoor attacks evolve through three stages. 1) Visble triggers using unrelated
patterns (Gu et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017), or optimized triggers (Liu et al., 2018b; Bagdasaryan
& Shmatikov, 2021; Zhao et al., 2020; Garg et al., 2020) for higher attack efﬁcacy. While this line’s
attack methods achieve high attack success rates and clean accuracy, the triggers are visible and
thus easily detected by human eyes. 2) Visually invisible triggers via solving bilevil optimizations
regarding the lp norm (Li et al., 2020a), or adopting nature optical effects (Liu et al., 2020; Nguyen
& Tran, 2021), and Clean label attacks via feature embeeding (Turner et al., 2019; Saha et al., 2020)
for better stealthiness. For most work from this line, the triggers or the poisons can evade the detec-
tion from manual efforts. 3) Invisible triggers considering other latent spaces, e.g., the frequency
domian (Zeng et al., 2021; Hammoud & Ghanem, 2021) or auto-encoder feature embedding (Li
et al., 2021b), which improved the stealthiness by breaking the fundamental assumptions of a list
of defenses. This paper incorporates successful attacks from these major groups and we show our
method provides an effective, and generalizable defense.
Backdoor Defenses. Backdoor defenses can be divided into four categories: 1) Poison detection via
outlier detection regarding functionalities or artifacts (Gao et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2018; Tran et al.,
2018; Koh & Liang, 2017; Chou et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2021), which rely on the modeling of clean
samples’ distribution. 2) Poisoned model identiﬁcation identiﬁes if a given model is backdoored
or not (Xu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). 3) Robust training via differential privacy (Du et al.,
2019; Weber et al., 2020) or ensembled/decoupled pipeline (Levine & Feizi, 2020; Jia et al., 2020;
2021; Huang et al., 2022). This line of work tries to achieve general robustness to withstand outlier’s
impact, but may suffer from low clean accuracy. 4) Backdoor removal via trigger synthesising (Wang
et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2019), or preprocessing & ﬁnetuning (Li et al., 2020b;
Borgnia et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2021). This line of work serves as the fundamental solution given
a poisoned model, but there is still no satisfying solution to attaining robust results across different
datasets and triggers. In this work, we propose a minimax formulation and a solver for backdoor
removal. We attempt to include all cutting-edge methods under this category for comparison.

PROBLEM FORMULATION"
INTRODUCTION,0.016917293233082706,"Attack model.
We assume that an adversary carries out a backdoor attack against a clean training
set generated from the distribution D. The adversary has pre-determined triggers and target classes.
The adversarial goal is to poison the training dataset such that, given a clean test sample x, adding a
backdoor pattern δ to x (i.e., x + δ) will alter the trained classiﬁer output to be a target class ˜y. The
norm of δ represents the adversary’s manipulative power. We assume that ||δ|| ≤Cδ. In general,
the attack can add r backdoored examples into the training set to induce the association between
the trigger δ and the target class ˜y. The ratio of the total backdoored examples over the size of the
training set is deﬁned as the poison ratio. For better stealthiness, attacks often aim not to affect the
prediction of a test example when the trigger is absent. Note that in our attack model, we explicitly
acknowledge the possibility that multiple trigger patterns and multiple target classes are present. We
will refer to the model trained on the poisoned training set as a poisoned model."

INTRODUCTION,0.020676691729323307,"Defense goal.
We consdier that the defender is given a poisoned classiﬁer fθpoi and an extra set of
clean data D = {(xi, yi)}n
i=1 from D. With fθpoi and D, the defender aims to build a model fθ∗
immunne to backdoors, i.e., fθ∗(x + δ) = fθ∗(x). Note that the size of available clean examples is
assumed to be much smaller than the size necessary to retrain a high-accuracy model from scratch."
INTRODUCTION,0.022556390977443608,"Minimax formulation for defense.
To achieve the defense goal, we want the resulting classiﬁer
to maintain the correct label even if the attacker patches the backdoor trigger to a given input. This
intuition naturally leads to the following minimax optimization formulation of backdoor removal:"

INTRODUCTION,0.02819548872180451,"where L is the loss function. Note that this formulation looks similar to adversarial training for
evasion attacks (a.k.a. adversarial examples) (Madry et al., 2017). The main distinction is that in
evasion attacks, the adversarial perturbation is speciﬁc to an individual data point, while in backdoor
attacks, the same perturbation (i.e., the backdoor trigger) is expected to cause misclassiﬁcations for
any examples upon being patched. Hence, in the formulation for backdoor attacks, the same trigger,
δ, is applied to every clean sample xi, whereas, in the minimax formulation for evasion attacks, the
perturbation is optimized independently for each sample (see Eq. (2.1), Madry et al. (2017))."
INTRODUCTION,0.03007518796992481,"The minimax formulation for backdoor removal has many advantages. 1), it gives us a unifying
perspective that encompasses much prior work on backdoor removal. The formulation comprises
an inner maximization problem and an outer minimization problem. Both of these problems have
a natural interpretation in the security context. The inner maximization problem aims to ﬁnd a
trigger that causes a high loss for predicting the correct label. This aligns with the problem of
a backdoor attack that misleads the model to predict a predeﬁned incorrect target label. In our
formulation, we choose to maximize the prediction loss for the correct label instead of using the
exact backdoor attack objective of minimizing the prediction loss associated with the target label.
We make this design choice because, in reality, the defender does not know the target labels selected
by the attacker. The outer minimization problem is to ﬁnd model parameters so that the “adversarial
loss” given by the inner attack problem is minimized. Existing backdoor removal approaches based
on trigger synthesis and unlearning the synthesized trigger (Wang et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019;
Guo et al., 2019) can be considered as a special instance of this minimax formulation, where they
neglect the interdependence between the inner and outer optimization and solve them separately. 2),
the formulation does not make any assumption on the backdoor trigger beyond the bounded norm
constraint. By contrast, much of the existing work makes additional assumptions about backdoor
triggers in order to be effective. For instance, synthesis-based approaches often assume that the
classes coinciding with the target classes of the triggers account for only a tiny portion of the total,
making those approaches ineffective in countering multiple target cases. 3), the formulation provides
a quantitative measure of backdoor robustness. In particular, when the parameters θ yield a (nearly)
vanishing loss, the corresponding model is perfectly robust to attacks speciﬁed by our attack model
on D. We will discuss the generalization properties of this formulation in Section 5. Using the
results developed there, we can further reason about the robustness on the data distribution D."

ALGORITHM"
ALGORITHM,0.03383458646616541,"A natural (but problematic) algorithm design.
Given the empirical success of adversarial train-
ing for defending against evasion attacks (Li et al., 2022), one may wonder whether we can solve
the minimax for the backdoor attack via adversarial training. Adversarial training keeps alternating
between two steps until the loss converges: (1) solving the inner maximization for a ﬁxed outer mini-
mization variable; and (2) solving the outer minimization by taking a gradient of the loss evaluated at
the maximum. Practically, adversarial training proceeds by ﬁrst generating adversarial perturbations
and then updating the model using the gradient calculated from the perturbed data. For backdoor at-
tacks, the adversarial perturbation needs to fool the model universally on all inputs. Hence, a natural
algorithm to solve the backdoor minimax problem is to tune the model with universal adversarial
perturbations. Universal adversarial perturbations have been studied in the past, and there exists an
off-the-shelf technique to create such perturbations (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017). However, we
found that this simple algorithm is highly unstable. Figure 1 illustrates the change of the model ac-
curacy and robustness (measured in terms of the attack success rate (ASR)) for 20 runs as adversarial
training proceeds. It can be seen that the ASR varies signiﬁcantly across different runs. Within a
single run, while the ASR decays as a whole, the decrement is mostly erratic and slow."

ALGORITHM,0.03759398496240601,"There are two issues with naive adversarial training with universal perturbations. First, the perfor-
mance of the existing universal perturbation algorithm is unstable. At its core, it generates adver-
sarial perturbations for each example and adds the perturbations together. The addition may not
always lead to a perturbation that can fool all examples; instead, the addition operation may cancel
the effect of individual perturbations. More importantly, the decoupling between solving the inner
maximization and the outer minimization in adversarial training is often justiﬁed by Danskin’s Theo-
rem (Danskin, 2012), which states that the gradient of the inner function involving the maximization
term is simply given by the gradient of the function evaluated at this maximum. In other words,
letting δ∗= arg max||δ||≤Cδ H(δ, θ), we have ∇θ max||δ||≤Cδ H(δ, θ) = ∇θH(δ∗, θ). However,
in practice, due to stochastic gradient descent, it is impossible to solve the inner maximization op-
timally. Worse yet, the underperformance of the existing universal perturbation algorithm makes it
even harder to approach the maximum. Moreover, Danskin’s Theorem only holds for convex loss
functions. Due to the violation of maximum condition and convexity, it is unsuitable for utilizing
Danskin’s Theorem, and hence, adversarial training is not justiﬁed."

is that second-order optimization algorithms are tolerant to the inaccuracy of Hessian (Byrd et al.,

EFFICACY
We evaluate I-BAU’s efﬁcacy against three attack settings: 1) One-trigger-one-target attack, in which
the attacker uses only one trigger, and there is only one target label. This setting is most commonly
considered in existing defense works. 2) One-trigger-all-to-all attack, in which the attacker uses
only one trigger but aims to mislead predictions from i to i+1, where i is the ground truth label (Gu
et al., 2017). 3) Multi-trigger-multi-target attack, where the attacker uses multiple distinct triggers,
each targeting a different label. We will refer to the ﬁrst two settings as “one-trigger setting” and the
last setting as “multi-trigger setting.” For each setting, we study seven different backdoor triggers
in the main text, namely, BadNets white square trigger (BadNets) (Gu et al., 2017), Hello Kitty
blending trigger (Blend) (Chen et al., 2017), l0 norm constraint invisible trigger (l0 inv) (Li et al.,
2020a), l2 norm constraint invisible trigger (l2 inv) (Li et al., 2020a), Smooth trigger (frequency
invisble trigger) (Smooth) (Zeng et al., 2021), Trojan square (Troj SQ) (Liu et al., 2018b), and
Trojan watermark (Troj WM) (Liu et al., 2018b). These trigger patterns are illustrated in Figure
3 in the Appendix. Given that I-BAU’s fundamental formulation takes backdoor noise as additive
noise, one may be curious about how I-BAU’s performance mitigates non-additive backdoor attacks.
We have included case studies on using I-BAU mitigating four non-additive triggers (semantical
replacement, WaNet (Nguyen & Tran, 2021), IAB attack (Nguyen & Tran, 2020)) and hidden trigger
attack (Saha et al., 2020) (non-additive poisoning) to illustrate the effectiveness (Appendix A.5).
For all experiments in the mian text, we adopt a large poison ratio of 20%, a severe attack case for
defenders. To acquire a poisoned model, we train on the poisoned dataset for 50 epochs."

et al., 2019). Note that DP requires access to the poisoned data; hence, its attack model is different
from the attack model of the other baselines and our method. In the following tables, we use [ ASR ] to
mark the results that fail to reduce the attack success rate (ASR) below 20%; we use [ ACC ] to mark
the results where the accuracy (ACC) on clean data drops by more than 10%; we use [ ACC or ASR ]
to mark the best result among the six baselines; ﬁnally, we use [ ACC or ASR ] to mark the results from
I-BAU that is comparable to or signiﬁcantly better than the best result among the baselines. We con-
sider I-BAU’s result as comparable if 1) the ACC gap is less than 1%, 2) the ASR gap is less than
4%, or the ASR of I-BAU is close to the label percental (i.e., the probability of random guessing for
outputting the target label, 10% for the CIFAR-10, 2.3 % for the GTSRB).
One-trigger Setting: Table 1 presents the defense results on the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10
contains 60,000 samples. We use 50,000 samples as training data, among which 10,000 samples are
poisoned. We used 5,000 separate samples as the clean set accessible to the defender for conducting
each defense (e.g., via unlearning, ﬁnetuning, trigger synthesis) except DP. The remaining 5,000
samples are used to assess the defense result. The left column depicts the attack cases. The ﬁrst
seven cases each contain only one target label. The all-to-all case represents the case in which we
use the BadNets trigger to carry out the one-trigger-all-to-all attack. As shown in the table, all single-
target attacks are capable of achieving an ASR close to 100% with no defenses. It is empirically
observed that the ASR of the all-to-all attack is upper-bounded by the ACC. Intuitively, the model
needs to classify the clean samples correctly to classify the corresponding backdoored samples with
triggers to the next class. Thus, we tune the model to produce an ASR that is close to the ACC."

fails to detect any backdoor triggers in this case). For DP, we ﬁne-tune a noise multiplier effective

NAD is the only baseline able to evaluate well on CIFAR-10, and
our methods achieve comparable performance. However, sim-
ilar to the one-trigger setting, NAD’s performance requires the
customization of preprocessing to different datasets. The default
preprocessing cannot maintain the same performance on GTSRB;
e.g., the random ﬂipping—a beneﬁcial preprocessing step for
CIFAR—completely alters the semantics of images in GTSRB.

comparison. We see that as the number of clean samples drops, the performance of all defenses

EFFICIENCY,0.19548872180451127,"Finally, we compare the efﬁciency of defenses. We use the one-
trigger-one-target attack setting to exemplify the result. Table 6
shows the average runtime for each defense to take effect (i.e.,
mitigating the ASR to < 20%). As I-BAU can mitigate the attacks
in one iteration, it only takes 6.82 s on average on CIFAR-10 and
7.84 s on GTSRB. Note that NC and TABOR need to go through
each label independently for trigger synthesis; thus, the total run-
time is proportional to the number of labels. Especially, it takes
much more time for the two to take effect on GTSRB than on
CIFAR-10. In difﬁcult attack cases, such as all-to-all attacks and
multi-trigger-multi-target attacks, I-BAU requires more rounds to be operative but remains the only
effective one across all settings with high efﬁciency and efﬁcacy. The Appendix shows the per-
formance of I-BAU over different rounds under multi-target attack cases. Theoretical analysis and
comparison of the time complexity of I-BAU are presented in Appendix A.3.3."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.19924812030075187,"In this work, we proposed a minimax formulation of the backdoor removal problem. This formula-
tion encompassed the objective of the existing unlearning work without making assumptions about
attack strategies or trigger patterns. To solve the proposed minimax, we proposed I-BAU using
implicit hypergradients. A theoretical analysis veriﬁed the convergence and generalizability of the
proposed I-BAU or minimax formulation. A comprehensive empirical study established that I-BAU
is the only generalizable defense across all evaluated eleven backdoor attacks. The defense results
are comparable to or exceed the best results obtained by combining six existing state-of-the-art tech-
niques. Meanwhile, I-BAU is less sensitive to poison rate and is effective in extreme cases where the
defender has access to only 100 clean samples. Finally, under the standard one-trigger-one-target
circumstances, I-BAU can achieve an effective defense in an average of 7.35 s."

the GAN is of the time complexity ˜O(θGAN), thus making the total time complexity roughly
equals to ˜O(max( ˜O(θGAN), ˜O(θ))). In practice, the overhead of training a GAN trigger in-
spector is much expensive (estimated 300× longer GPU time on the CIFAR-10) than training
θ.
• FP mitigates backdoor attacks via multi rounds (K2 rounds) of pruning the network; in practice,
FP requires more than 100 rounds of pruning (used half the number of samples for pruning, and
the rest is for ﬁne-tuning) to meet the stop requirements.
• NAD’s time complexity is proportional to the number of epochs used to ﬁne-tune the student and
teacher models. As those two models share the same structure, we assume the time complexity
of training them over the unlearning dataset is ˜O(θ). Assuming teacher model training phase
takes K3 epochs, and tuning student model based on the teacher model takes K4 epochs, then
the total time complexity is ˜O((K3 + 2 × K4) ˜O(θ)). In practice, we adopted K3 = K4 = 20
according to the original work."

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILED SETTINGS"

convolutional layer, we used batch normalization, and ELU is adopted as the activation function for
each. We use Adam with a learning rate of 0.05 as the optimizer for poisoned models. The models
are trained with 50 epochs over each poisoned dataset to converge and attain the results shown in
the main text. Our experiment adopted ten NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPUs as the computing units with
four servers equipped with AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1920X 12-Core Processors. Interestingly,
the same experiments showed slower convergence (it takes more rounds to mitigate the backdoors)
using GTX TITAN X and GTX 2080 TI. To reproduce the exact experimental results, we suggest
considering adopting NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPUs for the experiments. PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019)
is adopted as the deep learning framework for implementations. For the settings of implementing
the I-BAU, the inner and outer is conducted with iterative optimizers (SGD or Adam) with a learning

• DI adopted model inversion technique for agnostic to the clean samples, yet made the defense’s

CASE STUDY ON NON-ADDITIVE BACKDOOR ATTACKS"
N,0.9342105263157895,"As our fundamental formulation takes backdoor triggers as additive noise, in this speciﬁc section,
we would like to evaluate the effectiveness of I-BAU towards non-additive backdoor attacks empir-
ically. We selected four unique backdoor attacks/ settings to evaluate I-BAU towards non-additive
attacks, which will be introduced as follows. 1) Semantical replacement (SR), which directly re-
places the poison image with a piece of different semantical information. We designed this attack
by directly changing all the poisoned images to an out-of-distributed ‘Hallo Kitty’ image with the
poisoned label. SR should be considered as one of the worst-case attack scenario in practice, as its
trigger is additional semantical information with a large norm bound; 2) WaNet (Nguyen & Tran,
2021) adopts a universal wrapping augmentation as the backdoor trigger. Under such a case, the
backdoor trigger becomes a speciﬁc augmentation technique but not direct information insertion or
addition. And WaNet has shown its ability to bypass some existing defense methods; 3) IAB attack
(Nguyen & Tran, 2020) adopts autoencoder to learn and assign sample-speciﬁc noise to inputs to
launch sample-speciﬁc backdoor attacks; 4) Hidden trigger (HT) attack (Saha et al., 2020) adopts
a unique poisoning procedure using projected gradient descent to compute adversarial noise, which
we consider as another example of a non-additive attack. We evaluate the effectiveness of I-BAU
against the above four non-additive attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We will illustrate their speciﬁc
settings and results in the following parts of this section."

TOWARDS MITIGATING SR"
N,0.9379699248120301,"We ﬁrst evaluate an extreme case where we replace the poisoned CIFAR-10 images with an out-
of-domain ’Hallo Kitty’ image. Such a procedure directly changes the semantic information of the
poisoned data. We set the target label as ’0’. Like the other evaluated attack, we replaced 20%
of the non-target-class samples with the trigger kitty and set the label as ’0’. As for launching the
attack during test time, we evaluate the same ’Hallo Kitty’ image exposed to the poisoned model and
measure the attack success rate (in this case it becomes either 100% or 0%). The target model here
adopted the small VGG16 introduced in our experiment. As for I-BAU, we adopted Adam optimizer
and a learning rate of 0.1 and an unlimited l2 norm bound (instead, we crop the perturbation’s value
and restricted it to 0-1 as discussed in Appendix A.3.1). The results before and after are listed below

acceptable ACC drop compared to the baseline. Interestingly, the extreme case directly inserts an
additional semantical link between the poison kitty and the class ’0’, which can be interpreted as
direct exposure of a speciﬁc training sample to the test set and interfere with the model general-
izability (aka, overﬁt to a rare feature). Surprisingly, I-BAU can effectively mitigate such attack
patterns. To our best knowledge, the above attack setting is never considered before. I-BAU also
shows a potential path towards resolving model overﬁtting issues. We will leave such discussion to
future work."

CIFAR-10; target label:0; ρb = ρc = 0.1; model: PreActResNet18. One difference is that we
