ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0035587188612099642,"Molecular design and synthesis planning are two critical steps in the process
of molecular discovery that we propose to formulate as a single shared task of
conditional synthetic pathway generation. We report an amortized approach to
generate synthetic pathways as a Markov decision process conditioned on a target
molecular embedding. This approach allows us to conduct synthesis planning
in a bottom-up manner and design synthesizable molecules by decoding from
optimized conditional codes, demonstrating the potential to solve both problems of
design and synthesis simultaneously. The approach leverages neural networks to
probabilistically model the synthetic trees, one reaction step at a time, according to
reactivity rules encoded in a discrete action space of reaction templates. We train
these networks on hundreds of thousands of artiﬁcial pathways generated from a
pool of purchasable compounds and a list of expert-curated templates. We validate
our method with (a) the recovery of molecules using conditional generation, (b)
the identiﬁcation of synthesizable structural analogs, and (c) the optimization of
molecular structures given oracle functions relevant to drug discovery."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.010676156583629894,"Designing new functional materials, such as energy storage materials (Hachmann et al., 2011; Janet
et al., 2020), therapeutic molecules (Zhavoronkov et al., 2019; Lyu et al., 2019), and environmentally
friendly materials (Zimmerman et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2021), is key to many societal and technological
challenges and is a central task of chemical science and engineering. However, traditional molecular
design processes are not only expensive and time-consuming, but also rely heavily on chance and
brute-force trial and error (Sanchez-Lengeling & Aspuru-Guzik, 2018). Thus, a systematic approach
to molecular design that can leverage data and minimize the number of costly experiments is of great
interest to the ﬁeld and is a prerequisite for autonomous molecular discovery (Coley et al., 2020a;b)."
INTRODUCTION,0.014234875444839857,"The core of computer-aided molecular discovery is molecular design. The objective of the task is to
identify novel molecules with desirable properties through de novo generation or to identify known
molecules through virtual screening. There has been a growing interest in applying machine learning
methods to tackle this task in recent years (Gómez-Bombarelli et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2018; You
et al., 2018; Bradshaw et al., 2019; 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2021), which has been the subject
of many reviews (Elton et al., 2019; Schwalbe-Koda & Gómez-Bombarelli, 2020; Vanhaelen et al.,
2020). Despite the large number of models developed, there are few examples that have proceeded
to experimental validation or been used in a realistic discovery scenario (Zhavoronkov et al., 2019;
Schneider & Clark, 2019). One major barrier to the deployment of these algorithms is that they lack
considerations of synthesizability (Gao & Coley, 2020; Huang et al., 2021); Gao & Coley (2020)
have demonstrated that when applied to goal-directed optimization tasks, de novo molecular design
algorithms can propose a high proportion of molecules for which no synthetic plan can be found
algorithmically."

INTRODUCTION,0.021352313167259787,"Planning and executing a practical synthetic route for a hypothetical molecular structure is a bottleneck
that hinders the experimental validation of molecular design algorithms. The goal of computer-
assisted synthesis planning (CASP) is to identify a series of chemically plausible reaction steps
beginning from available starting materials to synthesize a target chemical compound. Machine
learning methods have been applied to improve CASP model performance (Segler et al., 2018; Coley
et al., 2018; 2019b; Schwaller et al., 2020; Genheden et al., 2020), and experimental execution has
validated signiﬁcant advances in recent years (Klucznik et al., 2018; Coley et al., 2019c). However,
most current algorithms require tens of seconds or minutes to plan a synthetic route for one target
compound due to the combinatorial complexity of the tree search. This cost makes a post hoc ﬁltering
strategy impractical in molecular design workﬂows that decouple de novo design and synthesis
planning (Gao & Coley, 2020). However, synthesizability-constrained generation has emerged as a
promising alternative to this two-step pipeline (Section 2.1)."
INTRODUCTION,0.02491103202846975,"In this paper, we report a strategy to generate synthetic pathways as trees conditioned on a target
molecular embedding as a means of simultaneously addressing the problems of design and synthesis.
Proposed pathways are guaranteed to make use of purchasable starting materials and are required
to follow the “rules of chemistry” as codiﬁed by expert-curated reaction templates, which can be
made more or less conservative depending on the application. When applied to synthesis planning,
we ask the model to generate synthetic trees conditioned on the target molecule. When applied to
synthesizable molecular design, we optimize the ﬁxed-length embedding vector using a numerical
optimization algorithm; then, we decode the optimized embedding to obtain the corresponding
synthetic tree whose root molecule is the output. The idea builds on the work of Bradshaw et al. (2019)
and Bradshaw et al. (2020); however, these methods failed to recover multi-step synthetic paths for
any target molecules and were thus only applied to the task of synthesizable analog recommendation.
In contrast, the method presented here can successfully recover multi-step retrosynthetic pathways in
an amortized manner, in addition to being used for synthesizable analog recommendation."
INTRODUCTION,0.028469750889679714,The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:
INTRODUCTION,0.03202846975088968,"• We formulate a Markov decision process to model the generation of synthetic trees, allowing
the generation of multi-step and convergent (i.e., nonlinear) synthetic pathways.
• We propose a model that is capable of (1) rapid bottom-up synthesis planning and (2)
constrained molecular optimization that can explore a chemical space deﬁned by a discrete
action space of reaction templates and purchasable starting materials.
• We show the ﬁrst successful attempt to amortized multi-step synthesis planning of complex
organic molecules, achieving relatively high reconstruction accuracy on test molecules.
• We demonstrate encouraging results on de novo molecular optimization with multiple
objective functions relevant to bioactive molecule design and drug discovery."

SYNTHESIZABLE MOLECULAR DESIGN,0.042704626334519574,"While most molecular generative models focus on the generation of valid molecules with desired
properties, there is growing interest in the generation of synthesizable molecules, as not all chemically
valid molecules are synthetically accessible. MoleculeChef (Bradshaw et al., 2019) was one of
the ﬁrst neural models to cast the problem of molecular generation as the generation of one-step
synthetic pathways, thus ensuring synthesizability, by selecting a bag of purchasable reactants and
using a data-driven reaction predictor to enumerate possible product molecules. ChemBO (Korovina
et al., 2020) extends constrained generation to the multi-step case, but is a stochastic algorithm that
generates synthetic pathways iteratively using random selections of reactants as input to another
data-driven reaction predictor. While MoleculeChef and ChemBO use neural models for reaction
outcome prediction as the ground truth for chemical reactivity (Coley et al., 2019b; Schwaller
et al., 2019), reaction templates provide an alternate means of deﬁning allowable chemical steps,
algorithmically (Coley et al., 2019a) or by hand-encoding domain expertise (Molga et al., 2019).
PGFS (Gottipati et al., 2020) and REACTOR (Horwood & Noutahi, 2020) both use discrete reaction
templates and formulate the generation of multi-step synthetic pathways as a Markov decision process
and optimize molecules with reinforcement learning. Both are limited to linear synthetic pathways,
where intermediates can only react with purchasable compounds and no reaction can occur between"

to the model. It is worth noting that there also exist previously reported methods for non-neural
synthesizability-constrained molecular design, such as SYNOPSIS (Vinkers et al., 2003) and DOGS
(Hartenfeller et al., 2012), which pre-date deep molecular generation."
SYNTHESIZABLE MOLECULAR DESIGN,0.05338078291814947,"Most recently, Bradshaw et al. (2020) introduced the DoG-AE/DoG-Gen model, which treats synthetic
pathways as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). DoG-Gen serializes the construction of the DAGs and
uses a recurrent neural network for autoregressive generation. Dai Nguyen & Tsuda (2021) also
employ an autoencoder (AE) framework, jointly trained with a junction tree variational autoencoder
(JT-VAE) (Jin et al., 2018). However, none of the previous methods for synthesizable molecular
generation have succeeded in achieving high reconstruction accuracy."

SYNTHESIS PLANNING"
SYNTHESIS PLANNING,0.060498220640569395,"Algorithms and models for synthesis planning have been in development since the 1960s when
retrosynthesis was ﬁrst formalized (Corey & Wipke, 1969). Various data-driven approaches have
been introduced in recent years (Segler et al., 2018; Coley et al., 2018; 2019b; Schwaller et al., 2020;
Genheden et al., 2020), although expert methods with human-encoded “rules of chemistry” have
arguably achieved greater success in practice (Klucznik et al., 2018; Mikulak-Klucznik et al., 2020).
The primary distinction between these methods is how allowable single-step chemical transformations
are deﬁned to mimic physical reality as closely as possible; they can all make use of similar tree search
algorithms. While these tools can be used to plan routes to target molecules and ﬁlter compounds
from de novo generation for which no pathway is found, none of them can be directly used for
molecular generation. Moreover, they all approach synthesis planning retrosynthetically, working
recursively from the target molecule towards purchasable starting materials (i.e. in a top-down
manner), whereas we propose a bottom-up approach that has the potential to be more computationally
efﬁcient by mitigating the need for a tree search."

approach is most similar to Bradshaw et al. (2020)’s RetroDoG model, their model was only applied
to structural analog generation, and could not demonstrate the successful recovery of target molecules.
Bradshaw et al. (2019) showed some examples of successful recovery, but their formulation restricts
the search to single-step synthetic pathways, which severely limits its practical utility for both tasks.
In contrast, our model can successfully handle multi-step reactions."

PROBLEM DEFINITION"
PROBLEM DEFINITION,0.07829181494661921,"We model synthetic pathways as tree structures called synthetic trees (Figure 6A in Appendix A).
A valid synthetic tree has one root node (the ﬁnal product molecule) linked to purchasable building
blocks via feasible reactions according to a list of discrete reaction templates. A reaction template is a
pattern deﬁning a structural transformation on molecules that is intended to represent a valid chemical
reaction, usually encoded as a SMARTS string (Figure 6B&C). We use a list of reaction templates
to deﬁne feasible chemical reactions instead of a data-driven reaction predictor so that the practical
utility of the model can be improved by reﬁning or expanding this set without changing its architecture.
Given a list of reaction templates, R, and a list of purchasable compounds, C, our goal is to generate
a valid synthetic tree, T, that produces a root molecule with a desired structure or function. The
product molecule and intermediate molecules in the tree are not themselves generated by the model,
but are implicitly deﬁned by the application of reaction templates to reactant molecules. Compared to
the generation of molecular graphs, the generation of synthetic trees is more difﬁcult because of the
additional constraints of enforcing chemical reaction rules and the commercial availability of starting
materials."

SYNTHETIC TREE GENERATION AS A MARKOV DECISION PROCESS,0.1387900355871886,"We propose an amortized approach to tackle the probabilistic modeling of synthetic trees. In this
approach, we model the construction of a synthetic tree as a Markov decision process (MDP),
which requires that the state transition satisﬁes the Markov property: p(S(t+1)|S(t), . . . , S(0)) =
p(S(t+1)|S(t)). This property is naturally satisﬁed by synthetic trees: upon obtaining a speciﬁc
compound (an intermediate in a synthetic route), subsequent reaction steps can be inferred entirely
from the intermediate compound, and do not depend on the pathway used to get to said compound
when conditioned on the target molecule. Below, we ﬁrst introduce an MDP framework for synthetic
tree generation, and then introduce the model to solve it. In our framework, we only allow uni- and
bi-molecular reactions."

process happens in a reverse depth-ﬁrst order, and that no more than two disconnected sub-trees are
generated simultaneously."
SYNTHETIC TREE GENERATION AS A MARKOV DECISION PROCESS,0.14590747330960854,"State Space We deﬁne the state, S(t), as the root molecule(s) of an intermediate synthetic tree, T (t)
at step t. Because we enforce that at most two sub-trees can occur simultaneously, there can be at
most two root molecules. All root nodes are generated in a reverse depth-ﬁrst fashion; additionally,
we enforce that the synthetic tree always expands from the most recently added node (Mmost_recent),
and that any merging always happens between two root nodes. The state embedding of a synthetic
tree is thus computed by concatenating the embeddings for the two root molecules."
SYNTHETIC TREE GENERATION AS A MARKOV DECISION PROCESS,0.1494661921708185,"Action Space We decompose the action taken at each iteration into four components: (1) the action
type, aact, which samples from possible actions “Add”, “Expand”, “Merge”, and “End”; (2) the ﬁrst
reactant, art1, which samples from either C or Mmost_recent; (3) the reaction template, arxn, which
samples from R; and (4) the second reactant, art2, which samples from C."

in building a synthetic tree and leads to an additional sub-tree.
(b) If aact = “Expand”, the most recent molecule, Mmost_recent, is used as the ﬁrst reactant, and
a second reactant is selected if arxn is a bi-molecular reaction template. If arxn is a uni-molecular
reaction template, only a new product node is added to T (t). If arxn is a bi-molecular reaction template,
both a new product node and a new reactant node are added.
(c) If aact = “Merge”, the two root nodes are used as the reactants in a bi-molecular reaction. In this
case, a new product node is added to T (t) and the two sub-trees are joined to form one sub-tree.

represent molecules as inputs to the MLPs, and Morgan ﬁngerprints of length 256 and radius 2 as
inputs to the k-NN module. Additional experiments with other molecular representations showed
worse empirical results; further analysis is provided in Appendix I."

GSK3β, and DRD2 surrogate models which estimate the response against c-Jun N-terminal kinases-3,
glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and dopamine receptor type 2, respectively. For the docking simulations,
we use AutoDock Vina (Trott & Olson, 2010) to dock against the human dopamine receptor D3

We use k = 3 in the ﬁrst reactant k-NN search and expand the trees in a greedy manner (k = 1) for

sizable structural analogs under the constraints of R and C (see Figure 3B for an example). The
metrics in Table 1 show how the product molecules in the unrecovered cases are still structurally
similar to the input molecules. We illustrate the correlation between the properties of target and
product molecules in Figure 4. We investigated the SA Score (Ertl & Schuffenhauer, 2009b), QED,
CLogP, and molecular weight, and observed that most product properties have a positive correlation
with the corresponding input properties. The least successful case is QED due to its high sensitivity
to structural changes as quantiﬁed by the structure-activity landscape index (SALI) (Guha, 2012)
(Table 6 in Appendix G). Overall, our model can suggest reasonable synthesizable analogs for target
molecules, especially when the desired property is highly correlated with molecular structure."
SYNTHESIZABLE ANALOG RECOMMENDATION RESULTS,0.3594306049822064,"In other cases where the target product is not recovered by the generated pathway, the output synthetic
tree may still provide inspiration for the synthesis of target molecules. Figure 3C highlights an
example where the failure of reconstruction is due to the binary Morgan ﬁngerprint’s inability to
distinguish repeating units. Our model successfully constructed one side of this symmetric molecule.
In this case, a synthetic chemist would likely recognize that replacing 1-isopropylpiperazine (the
reactant added in the second step) with piperazine may lead to synthesis of the target molecule."

compounds in C through a simple Suzuki reaction (see Figure 12 for the synthetic pathway). This
makes our model’s recommendation more immediately actionable, i.e., ready for experimental
validation. As an additional quasi-realistic application to structure-based drug design, we optimized
the binding afﬁnity to DRD3 and Mpro of SARS-Cov-2 as an example target protein and successfully
generated multiple molecules with improved docking scores relative to a known inhibitor (see Figure
5). We used the Guacamol ﬁlter (Brown et al., 2019) and SA_Score (Ertl & Schuffenhauer, 2009a) to
quantitatively evaluate the top-100 generated molecules against DRD3 and compared them to the

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.3914590747330961,"In this work, we have introduced an amortized approach to conditional synthetic tree generation which
can be used for synthesis planning, synthesizable analog recommendation, and molecular design
and optimization. Our model bridges molecular generation and synthesis planning by coupling them
together into one rapid step, eliminating the need for two-stage pipelines of generation and ﬁltering.
We have demonstrated promising results for a variety of molecular optimization tasks with relevance
to drug discovery, illustrating how this approach can be used to effectively explore synthesizable
chemical space in pursuit of new functional molecules. Additional outlook is in Appendix C."

OUTLOOK"
REFERENCES,0.6903914590747331,"While our model shows promising results on the recovery of molecules from generated trees and de
novo molecular optimization performance, there remain multiple challenges to be addressed:"
REFERENCES,0.693950177935943,"Initial Reactant Selection Our results show that the ﬁrst reactant selection is the primary bottleneck
to target molecule recovery. We consider two major reasons for this: (1) the input to frt1 is usually
the target molecule only, with no action mask applied. The large action space (i.e., all purchasable
molecules) and the limited input information thus make the problem the most difﬁcult of the four
tasks; (2) during the generation of the synthetic trees, we adopt a depth-ﬁrst approach that implicitly
introduces a canonical ordering during reactant selection. The implicit ordering is arbitrary and might
harm the training of the network. Allowing the model to predict any valid order or including multiple
orders as a form of data augmentation may improve performance. Further, it may be possible to ﬁrst
select the action (template) to constrain the space of compatible ﬁrst reactants, which may improve
performance given that this is a smaller search space."
REFERENCES,0.697508896797153,"Reaction Templates and Purchasable Compound Selection The deﬁnition of synthesizable used
in this work is that the molecule can be reached with a synthetic pathway only containing starting
materials belonging to our list of purchasable compounds and reactions that follow our list of reaction
templates. Here, we use only 91 templates, which pales in comparison to the ∼1,300 reaction families
deﬁned by NameRxn (Sayle & Lowe) the tens of thousands of templates in the expert CASP program
SYNTHIA (Szymku´c et al., 2016), and the hundreds of thousands in the data-driven CASP program
ASKCOS (Coley et al., 2019c). Using a more comprehensive set of reaction templates would enlarge
the chemical space our model can explore. Additional constraints on template applicability could
improve the feasibility of pathways, e.g., to mitigate selectivity concerns (cf. Figure 12)."
REFERENCES,0.701067615658363,"Molecular Representation and Molecular Similarity Certain results (e.g., Figure 3C) reveal a
limitation of using boolean Morgan ﬁngerprints. As this type of ﬁngerprint only accounts for the
presence or absence of speciﬁc substructures, it cannot distinguish molecules with different numbers
of repeated units or other symmetries. Applying a count or summation-based representation, coupled
with development of a similarity measurement based on that representation, would solve this problem."
REFERENCES,0.7046263345195729,"Beam Search for Decoding Besides tackling the aforementioned challenges, in future work we also
plan to implement beam search with our networks to enhance the model performance for bottom-up
synthesis planning. Improving the sample efﬁciency of the synthesizable molecular design algorithm
(the GA module), and applying it to more high-ﬁdelity computational oracles would also be of interest.
Those advances could enable faster and more accurate synthesis planning, as well as an even better
tool for de novo molecular design."

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS"
REFERENCES,0.7295373665480427,"Network Setup For all experiments reported in this paper, the four networks, fact, frt1, frxn, and
frt2, use 5 fully connected layers with 1000, 1200, 3000, and 3000 neurons in the hidden layers,
respectively. Batch normalization is applied to all hidden layers before ReLU activation. In fact and
frxn, a softmax is applied after the last layer and cross entropy loss is used, while frt1 and frt2 use a
linear activation in the last layer and mean squared error (MSE) loss. We use the Adam optimizer to
train all networks with a learning rate of 1e-4 and mini-batch size of 64."
REFERENCES,0.7330960854092526,"Training Each MLP is trained as a separate supervised learning problem using a subset of information
from the known synthetic routes. For instance, frxn is a classiﬁcation network which learns to select
a discrete action given information on the current state of the tree, the target molecule, and the ﬁrst
reactant. Similarly, fact is a classiﬁcation network which learns to select the correct action type given
the state of the tree. On the other hand, frt1 and frt2 learn embeddings (regression) for the ﬁrst and
second reactant candidates, respectively, followed by a nearest-neighbors search from C and C′."
REFERENCES,0.7366548042704626,"Dataset Preparation Following the procedure we described in Section 3.2, we applied a random
policy to generate the synthetic trees. We randomly sampled purchasable reactants, and randomly
applied matching reaction templates to them. Doing so, we obtained 550k synthetic trees and ﬁltered
