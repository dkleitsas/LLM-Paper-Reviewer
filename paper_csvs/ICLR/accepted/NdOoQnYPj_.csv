ABSTRACT,0.003676470588235294,"Online learning via Bayes’ theorem allows new data to be continuously integrated
into an agent’s current beliefs. However, a naive application of Bayesian methods
in non-stationary environments leads to slow adaptation and results in state esti-
mates that may converge conﬁdently to the wrong parameter value. A common
solution when learning in changing environments is to discard/downweight past
data; however, this simple mechanism of “forgetting” fails to account for the fact
that many real-world environments involve revisiting similar states. We propose a
new framework, Bayes with Adaptive Memory (BAM), that takes advantage of past
experience by allowing the agent to choose which past observations to remember
and which to forget. We demonstrate that BAM generalizes many popular Bayesian
update rules for non-stationary environments. Through a variety of experiments,
we demonstrate the ability of BAM to continuously adapt in an ever-changing
world."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.011029411764705883,"The ability of an agent to continuously modulate its belief while interacting with a non-stationary
environment is a hallmark of intelligence and has garnered a lot of attention in recent years (Zhang
et al., 2020; Ebrahimi et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020). The Bayesian framework enables online
learning by providing a principled way to incorporate new observations into an agent’s model of
the world (Jaynes, 2003; Gelman et al., 2013). Through the use of Bayes’ theorem, the agent can
combine its own (subjective) a priori knowledge with data to achieve an updated belief encoded by
the posterior distribution."
INTRODUCTION,0.014705882352941176,"The Bayesian framework is a particularly appealing option for online learning because Bayes’
theorem is closed under recursion, enabling continuous updates in what is commonly referred to
as the recursive Bayes method (Wakeﬁeld, 2013). As an example, suppose the agent ﬁrst observes
a batch of data, D1, and then later observes another batch of data, D2. We can express the agent’s
posterior distribution over the world, where the world is represented by θ, as"

INTRODUCTION,0.029411764705882353,"Equation 1 demonstrates the elegance and simplicity of recursive Bayes: at time t, the agent recycles
its previous posterior, p(θ|D<t), where D<t = {D1, · · · , Dt−1}, into its current prior and then
combines it with a newly observed batch of data, Dt, to obtain an updated posterior, p(θ|D≤t)."

INTRODUCTION,0.04044117647058824,"At ﬁrst glance, it would appear that a naive application of recursive Bayes would sufﬁce for most
online learning tasks. However, the recursive Bayes method relies on the assumption that the world
is stationary, i.e. D1, D2, · · · are all independent and identically distributed. When this assumption
is violated, recursive Bayes can fail catastrophically. As an illustration, consider the law of total
variance:
Var(θ|D<t) = E[Var(θ|D<t, Dt)
D<t] + Var(E[θ|D<t, Dt]
D<t).
(3)"
INTRODUCTION,0.04411764705882353,"Since both terms on the right hand side are positive, equation 3 reveals that in expectation, the
variance of the posterior decreases as more data is seen regardless of the actual distribution of Dt,
i.e.
Var(θ|D<t) ≥E[Var(θ|D<t, Dt)
D<t].
(4)"
INTRODUCTION,0.04779411764705882,"In fact, for some models equation 4 is true with probability 1; we demonstrate examples in Appendix A.
Thus, if the parameters of the environment, θ, were to change, the variance of the posterior would
still decrease, becoming more certain of a potentially obsolete parameter estimate. Modeling the
environment as stationary when it is actually changing also keeps the learning speed of the agent
artiﬁcially low, as tighter posteriors prevent large jumps in learning. This is the opposite of what an
intelligent agent should do in such an event: if the environment changes, we would expect the agent’s
uncertainty and learning speed to increase in response."
INTRODUCTION,0.051470588235294115,"As was elegantly stated by Monton (2002), the problem with naive use of recursive Bayes is that ""Such
a Bayesian never forgets."" Previous approaches on enabling recursive Bayes to work in non-stationary
settings have primarily focused on forgetting past experience either through the use of changepoint
detection (Adams & MacKay, 2007; Li et al., 2021), or by exponentially weighting past experiences
(Moens, 2018; Moens & Zénon, 2019; Masegosa et al., 2020). While empirically successful, their
focus on forgetting the past means that revisited states are treated as novel. In this work we take an
alternative approach to online Bayesian learning in non-stationary environments by endowing an
agent with an explicit memory module. Crucially, the addition of a memory buffer equips the agent
with the ability to modulate its uncertainty by choosing what past experiences to both forget and
remember. We call our approach Bayes with Adaptive Memory (BAM) and demonstrate its wide
applicability and effectiveness on a number of non-stationary learning tasks."

A popular approach is to model the latent dynamics (equation 5) as an autoregressive process (Kurle
et al., 2020; Rimella & Whiteley, 2020). While this approach has been popular, it is only applicable for
models where the parameters are real-valued. A seminal work on Bayesian ﬁltering is the Bayesian
online changepoint detction (BOCD) algorithm of Adams & MacKay (2007), where the latent
dynamics (equation 5) are modeled to be piece-wise constant. While BOCD is broadly applicable and
has seen empirical success, the caveat is that an agent forgets all previous experience when a change
is detected; thus, previously visited states appear novel to the agent and learning must begin from
scratch. An extension to BOCD was proposed by Li et al. (2021), where when a change is detected a
scaled version of the previous posterior is used as the prior. While similar in spirit to BAM, we note
that the approach proposed in Li et al. (2021) is designed for Gaussian distributions, while BAM can
work with arbitrary distributions. Moreover, the approach in Li et al. (2021) can only increase the
uncertainty by a ﬁxed pre-determined amount while BAM can adaptively modulate its uncertainty."

the posterior and log marginal likelihood are only available analytically for conjugate priors (Gelman

and causing it to converge to the average with an extremely low posterior variance. BOCD tracks
the parameter relatively well, though its estimates are slightly delayed. As BOCD lacks the ability
to recall useful data from the past, its posterior variance resets every time a changepoint is detected.
BAM is able to track θt and doesn’t suffer from temporal lag seen in the BOCD results, though the
lack of regularization leads to estimates that are not as smooth as BOCD. The posterior variance
of BAM reﬂects that the agent remembers relevant history and forgets irrelevant history, reducing
the jump in posterior variance when revisiting a previously seen state. Lastly, we can see that BAM
with regularization leads to smoother estimates but tends to be less conﬁdent compared to the other
methods."

EXPERIMENT 2: CONTROLS"
EXPERIMENTS,0.29044117647058826,"In this section we illustrate the beneﬁt of memory by applying BAM on a learning task to model
non-linear dynamics for controls. The task is an analytical version of Cartpole (Barto et al., 1983),
where the goal is to swing-up a pole on a moving cart. Non-stationarity is introduced by changing
the environment’s gravity over time. We explore the performance of BAM under two different
information models. In the episodic setting, the agent is told when a change occurs, but not the
value of the new gravity parameter. In the continual learning setting, the agent is not informed of
environmental changes.4"
EXPERIMENTS,0.29411764705882354,"The reward for the task is the cosine of the angle of the pole on the cart, where an angle of 0◦is
the vertical ‘up’ position. To make the problem amenable for analytical posterior and log marginal
likelihood computations, we model the nonlinear dynamics using linear regression with random
Fourier features (RFF) (Rahimi & Recht, 2007)"

EPISODIC ONE-SHOT"
EPISODIC ONE-SHOT,0.3161764705882353,"In this setting our simulated Cartpole hypothetically moves between different planets—hence a change
in gravity—while still being asked to swing the pole up. In an episode, gravity is ﬁxed for the duration
of 15 trials, where each trial resets the Cartpole to a random initial state, x0. Each trial produces
a trajectory of states and actions of length H that are batched into one unit of data, such that each
episode contributes 15 experiences; thus the datum for trial t is Dt = {([xj, aj], [xj −xj−1])}H
j=1."
EPISODIC ONE-SHOT,0.31985294117647056,"We compare BAM to recursive Bayes in a one-shot manner: after the ﬁrst trial of a new episode,
BAM computes a weight vector over all previously encountered trial data to inform a posterior for the
duration of the episode. Recursive Bayes is reset to the base prior at the beginning of a new episode.
Both proceed to update their belief every trial in an episode."
EPISODIC ONE-SHOT,0.3235294117647059,"We show in Figure 2 results over 5 random seeds where the expected score for a ground truth model is
shown as a reference. The ﬁrst time BAM encounters a novel planet, it resets its prior to the base prior
and starts learning from scratch, similar to recursive Bayes. On subsequent visits however, BAM
is able to leverage its past experiences to quickly adapt and recover high levels of performance. As
recursive Bayes starts from scratch, it will again need multiple trials to develop a competent model."

CONTINUAL LEARNING,0.33455882352941174,"In addition to the challenge of adapting to a different environment, we also test BAM when the agent
is not informed of the change, such that adaption must happen continually. In this scenario without
explicit episodes, the gravity of the world can change after a trial, unbeknownst to the agent. Similar
to the previous setting, a datum for trial t is Dt = {([xj, aj], [xj −xj−1])}H
j=1."
CONTINUAL LEARNING,0.3382352941176471,"While it is straightforward to run BAM in this setting, we also investigate combining BAM with
BOCD, which we denote as BAM + BOCD. In BOCD, the detection of a changepoint causes the
posterior distribution to be reset to the base prior. In BAM + BOCD, the detection of a changepoint is
used as signal for when the agent should adapt its prior by computing Wt, to obtain p(θt|Wt, D<t);
this avoids rerunning the optimization procedure after each trial."
CONTINUAL LEARNING,0.34191176470588236,"We show in Figure 3 that while BOCD works as intended, without BAM the Cartpole has to relearn a

each other, suggesting that we can bypass unnecessary computation."

methods perform similarly until BAM encounters an environment it has experienced before, in which
it adapts more quickly than BOCD. The initial similarity is due to both methods detecting similar
changepoints and reverting to un-informed priors. Naive BAM performs well, albeit with weight
optimization after each trail versus only during detected changepoints for the other methods (60
optimizations versus ∼5)."

CONTINUAL LEARNING,0.3639705882352941,"A common environment for testing the performance of online learning algorithms is the bandits
setting (Sutton & Barto, 2018). We study a non-stationary version of the bandits setting where each
arm switches between two values asynchronously, such that the best arm could be, at any point in
time, a previously low value arm. Gaussian noise with σ = 0.25 is additionally added to the current
arm value. Sample arm values can be found in Figure 5."
CONTINUAL LEARNING,0.36764705882352944,"For stationary bandits, a popular algorithm is Thompson sampling (Thompson, 1933) in which
a posterior over each arm is continually updated via recursive Bayes. These posteriors are then"

agent to automatically switch between exploration and exploitation. In the non-stationary setting,
we would expect vanilla Thompson sampling to fail as the arm posteriors would continue becoming
more certain, as is evident from section 4.1. While there are many approaches for how to adapt BAM
to perform well in the non-stationary bandits setting, we take a simple approach and combine BAM
with the upper conﬁdence bound (UCB) bandit algorithm (Agrawal, 1995), which we call UCBAM;
in the interest of space, we provide an algorithm table in Appendix D.3.1. We compare UCBAM
against UCB, Thompson sampling, Bayesian exponential forgetting + Thompson sampling and a
BOCD + Thompson sampling scheme proposed by Mellor & Shapiro (2013); hyperparameter values
can be found in Appendix D.3. From Figure 4, we see that UCBAM outperforms the other methods
for both 10 and 50 arms. Thompson sampling fails to capture the true current values of the arms
and suffers a large penalty while exploration afforded by UCB enables better performance. BOCD
achieves low regret in the 10 arm setting, but reverts to its prior too often to perform well with 50
arms."

EXPERIMENT 4: DOMAIN ADAPTATION WITH ROTATED MNIST"
CONTINUAL LEARNING,0.38235294117647056,"In the image classiﬁcation setting, we often want to operate across a variety of domains. Traditional
approaches include learning a single high capacity model or encoding assumptions about the domain
structure into the system (Jaderberg et al., 2015; Worrall et al., 2017). Instead, we use a simple
multivariate linear regression model where the targets are one-hot encoded labels, taking the highest
output as the selected class. We consider a setting where the distribution of domains is known and is
the same at both train and test time and evaluate BAM’s ability to classify given a small number of
labeled examples from the domains to adapt its belief. To achieve this, we create a rotated MNIST
dataset. 32 domains were created, where each domain was comprised of 1,875 randomly sampled
without replacement from the training set. In a domain, the images are rotated by an angle sampled
uniformly at random from 0 to π. Each domain is treated as one batch of data in the memory buffer,
i.e. Di = {(xi
j, yi
j)}1875
j=1 . We split and rotate the test set similarly into 8 domains and give 10 labeled
examples from each to ﬁnd readout weights over the training data. We calculate the average accuracy
over all test domains and collect results over 10 random seeds. While OLS trained over all domains
get a mean and standard deviation accuracy of 55% ± 3.7% accuracy, BAM is able to achieve a test
set accuracy of 71.8% ± 5.2%, showing that BAM is able to leverage previous experiences to adapt
to novel domains."

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.3897058823529412,"In this work we present BAM, a ﬂexible Bayesian framework that allows agents to adapt to non-
stationary environments. Our key contribution is the addition of a memory buffer to the Bayesian
framework, which allows the agent to adaptively change its prior by choosing which past experiences
to remember and which to forget. Empirically, we show the proposed approach is general enough
to be deployed in a variety of problem settings such as online inference, control, non-stationary
bandits and domain adaptation. To ensure that we isolated the beneﬁts of BAM, the experiments
focused on conjugate-prior distributions as it allowed us to compute the prior/posterior and the
log-marginal likelihood in closed form. Future work will focus on leveraging advances in streaming
variational inference (Broderick et al., 2013; Kurle et al., 2020) to allow BAM to be deployed on
more complicated models, i.e. Bayesian deep neural networks. For simplicity, we focused on binary
values for the readout weights as it allowed for a simple greedy discrete optimization algorithm
to be used. We imagine that allowing the weights to be any value between 0 and 1 will increase
performance in certain settings and allow BAM to have a much larger repertoire of priors that it can
construct, as well as suggest different optimization algorithms to use within the framework. Finally,
efﬁcient memory buffer schemes will be explored to avoid the ’inﬁnite memory’ problem of continual
learning, enabling BAM to operate with efﬁciency indeﬁnitely."

regularization term. The ﬁrst is a bottom-up approach, where we start with all readout weights

DESCRIPTION OF UCBAM"
REFERENCES,0.9669117647058824,"The challenge of bandit settings is the need to explore, especially in the non-stationary setting we
devised. As such, UCB is a well known algorithm for leveraging the uncertainty in the arm values to
enable exploration. We combine this frequentist method with BAM as follows. When we assume to
‘know’ the current best arm value, we exploit it and keep a belief over its distribution with BAM. The
signal for whether the best arm is ‘known’ is if the likelihood of the current arm’s value is higher
with our current arm belief or higher with the naive base prior. If the base prior produces a higher
likelihood, we assume the current arm distribution is incorrect (and will be updated with BAM), and
we default to the UCB metric for arm selection. This simple combination of methods in this setting
allows for the exploration beneﬁts of UCB with the quick recognition of high value arms due to BAM
and subsequent exploitation."

times, such that the highest value arm may be a previously low value arm. The simplest strategy
would be to ﬁnd the highest mean value arm, which is what UCB does in this case. Recursive Bayes
attempts the same, but does not explore sufﬁciently to achieve an accurate estimate of the mean arm
values."
