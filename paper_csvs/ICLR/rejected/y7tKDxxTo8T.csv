ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.002967359050445104,"Performance of recommender systems (RecSys) relies heavily on the amount of
training data available. This poses a chicken-and-egg problem for early-stage
products, whose amount of data, in turn, relies on the performance of their RecSys.
In this paper, we explore the possibility of zero-shot learning in RecSys, to enable
generalization from an old dataset to an entirely new dataset. We develop an
algorithm, dubbed ZEro-Shot Recommenders (ZESREC), that is trained on an
old dataset and generalize to a new one where there are neither overlapping users
nor overlapping items, a setting that contrasts typical cross-domain RecSys that
has either overlapping users or items. Different from previous methods that use
categorical item indices (i.e., item ID), ZESREC uses items’ generic features, such
as natural-language descriptions, product images, and videos, as their continuous
indices, and therefore naturally generalizes to any unseen items. In terms of users,
ZESREC builds upon recent advances on sequential RecSys to represent users
using their interactions with items, thereby generalizing to unseen users as well.
We study three pairs of real-world RecSys datasets and demonstrate that ZESREC
can successfully enable recommendations in such a zero-shot setting, opening
up new opportunities for resolving the chicken-and-egg problem for data-scarce
startups or early-stage products."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.008902077151335312,"Many large scale e-commerce platforms (such as Etsy, Overstock, etc.) and online content plat-
forms (such as Spotify, Overstock, Disney+, Netﬂix, etc) have such a large inventory of items that
showcasing all of them in front of their users is simply not practical. In particular, in the online
content category of businesses, it is often seen that users of their service do not have a crisp intent in
mind unlike in the retail shopping experience where the users often have a clear intent of purchasing
something. The need for personalized recommendations therefore arises from the fact that not only it
is impractical to show all the items in the catalogue but often times users of such services need help
discovering the next best thing — be it the new and exciting movie or be it a new music album or
even a piece of merchandise that they may want to consider for future buying if not immediately."
INTRODUCTION,0.011869436201780416,"Modern personalized recommendation models of users and items have often relied on the idea of
extrapolating preferences from similar users. Different machine learning models deﬁne the notion of
similarity differently. Classical bi-linear Matrix Factorization (MF) approaches model users and items
via their identiﬁers and represent them as vectors in the latent space [13; 28]. Modern deep-learning-
based recommender systems [34; 12; 25], which are also used for predicting top-k items given an
item, learn the user-to-item propensities from large amounts of training data containing many (user,
item) tuples, optionally with available item content information (e.g., product descriptions) and user
metadata."
INTRODUCTION,0.01483679525222552,"As machine learning models, the performance of RecSys relies heavily on the amount of training data
available. This might be feasible for large e-commerce or content delivery websites such as Overstock
and Netﬂix, but poses a serious chicken-and-egg problem for small startups, whose amount of data,
in turn, relies on the performance of their RecSys. On the other hand, zero-shot learning promises
some degree of generalization from an old dataset to an entirely new dataset. In this paper, we
explore the possibility of zero-shot learning in RecSys. We develop an algorithm, dubbed ZEro-Shot
Recommenders (ZESREC), that is trained on an old dataset and generalize to a new one where there

INTRODUCTION,0.020771513353115726,"RecSys that has either overlapping users or items [40; 38; 3; 16]. Naturally, generalization of RecSys
to unseen users and unseen items becomes the two major challenges for developing zero-shot RecSys."
INTRODUCTION,0.02373887240356083,"For the ﬁrst challenge on unseen users, we build on a rich body of literature on sequential recommen-
dation models [12; 27; 25; 14; 17; 21]. These models are built with sequential structure to encode
temporal ordering of items in user’s item interaction history. Representing users by the items they
have consumed in the past allows the model to extrapolate the preference learning to even novel users
who the model did not see during training, as long as the items these unseen users have interacted with
have been seen during training. However, such deep learning models encode item via its categorical
item index, i.e., the item ID, and therefore fall short in predicting a likely relevant but brand-new item
not previously seen during training."
INTRODUCTION,0.026706231454005934,"This brings us to the second challenge of developing zero-shot recommender systems, i.e., dealing
with unseen items. To address this challenge, ZESREC goes beyond traditional categorical item
indices and uses items’ generic features such as natural-language descriptions, product images,
and videos as their continuous indices, thereby naturally generalizing to any unseen items. Take
natural-language (NL) descriptions as an example. One can think of NL descriptions as a system of
universal identiﬁers that indexes items from arbitrary domains. Therefore as long as one model is
trained on a dataset with NL descriptions, it can generalize to a completely different dataset with a
similar NL vocabulary. In ZESREC we build on state-of-the-art pretrained NL embedding models
such as BERT [8] to extract NL embeddings from raw NL descriptions, leading to an item ID system
in the continuous space that is generalizable across arbitrary domains. For instance, in e-commerce
platform, one could use items’ description text; and similarly in the online content platforms, one
could use movie synopsis or music track descriptions to represent an item."
INTRODUCTION,0.02967359050445104,"Combining the merits of sequential RecSys and the idea of universal continuous ID space, our
ZESREC successfully enables recommendation in an extreme cold-start setting, i.e., the zero-shot
setting where all users and items in the target domain are unseen during training. Essentially ZESREC
tries to learn transferable user behavioral patterns in a universal continuous embedding space. For
example, in the source domain, ZESREC can learn that if users purchase snacks or drinks (e.g., ‘Vita
Coconut Water’ with a lemonade ﬂavor) that they like, they may purchase similar snacks or drinks
with different ﬂavors (e.g., ‘Vita Coconut Water’ with a pineapple ﬂavor), as shown in the case study.
Later in the target domain, if one user purchase ‘V8 Splash’ with a tropical ﬂavor, ZESREC can
recommend ‘V8 Splash’ with a berry ﬂavor to the user (see Fig. 4 of Sec. 4.6 for details). Such
generalization is possible due to the use of the NL descriptions as universal identiﬁers, based on
which ZESREC could easily identify similar products of the same brand with different ﬂavors. To
summarize our contributions:"
INTRODUCTION,0.032640949554896145,"• We identify the problem of zero-shot recommender systems and propose ZESREC as the
ﬁrst hierarchical Bayesian model for addressing this problem.
• We introduce the notion of universal continuous identiﬁers that makes recommendation in a
zero-shot setting possible.
• We provide empirical results which show that ZESREC can successfully recommend items
in the zero-shot setting.
• We conduct case studies demonstrating that ZESREC can learn interpretable user behavioral
patterns that can generalize across datasets."

RELATED WORK,0.03857566765578635,"Deep Learning for RecSys. Deep learning has been prevalent in modern recommender systems [29;
33; 34; 19; 4; 10; 32] due to its scalability and superior performance. As a pioneer work, [29] uses
restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to perform collaborative ﬁltering in recommender systems,
however the system is a single-layer RBM. Later, [34] and [19] build upon Bayesian deep learning to
develop hierarchical Bayesian models that tightly integrate content information and user-item rating
information, thereby signiﬁcantly improving recommendation performance. After that, there are also
various proposed sequential (or session-based) recommender systems [12; 27; 2; 18; 22; 39; 14; 31;
41; 25], GRU4Rec [12] was ﬁrst proposed to use gated recurrent units (GRU) [6] for recommender
systems. Since then, follow-up works such as hierarchical GRU [27], temporal convolutional networks
(TCN) [2], and hierarchical RNN (HRNN) [25] have achieved improvement in terms of accuracy by
utilizing cross-session information [27], causal convolutions [2], as well as meta data and control"

as SASRec [14], BERT4Rec [31], and S3Rec [41]. In this paper we build on such sequential RecSys
and note that our ZESREC is model agnostic, that is, it is compatible with any sequential RecSys."
RELATED WORK,0.04747774480712166,"Cross-Domain and Cold-Start RecSys. There is a rich literature on cross-domain RecSys focusing
on training a recommender system in the source domain and deploying it in the target domain where
there exist either common users or items [40; 38; 3; 16]. These works are also related to the problem
of recommendation for cold-start users and items, i.e., users and items with few interactions (or
ratings) available during training [11; 20; 42; 23]. There are also works [24; 9] handling cold start on
both user and item with meta-learning, however they cannot generalize across domains. In summary,
prior systems are either (1) not sufﬁcient to address our zero-shot setting where there are neither
common users nor common items in the target domain or (2) unable to learn user behavior patterns
that are transferable across datasets/domains. Therefore, they are not applicable to our problem of
zero-shot recommendations."

ZERO-SHOT RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS,0.05341246290801187,"In this section we introduce our ZESREC which is compatible with any sequential model. Without
loss of generality, here we focus on NL descriptions as a possible instantiation of universal identiﬁers,
but note that our method is general enough to use as identiﬁers other content information such as
items’ images and videos. We leave exploration for other potential modalities to future work."
ZERO-SHOT RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS,0.05637982195845697,"Notation. We focus on the setting of zero-shot recommendation where there are neither overlapping
users nor overlapping items between a source domain and a target domain. We assume a set Vs
of Js items and a set Us of Is users in the source domain, as well as a set Vt of Jt items and a set
Ut of It users in the target domain. We let I = Is + It and J = Js + Jt; we use j ∈Vs ∪Vt to
index items and i ∈Us ∪Ut to index users. The zero-shot setting dictates that Vs ∩Vt = ∅and
that Us ∩Ut = ∅. We denote the collection of all users’ interactions as a 3D tensor (with necessary
zero-padding) R ∈RI×Nmax×J, where Nmax is the maximum number of interactions among all
users. We use the subscript ‘∗’ to represent the collection of all elements in a certain dimension.
Speciﬁcally, each user i has a sequence of Ni interactions (e.g., purchase history) with various items
denoted as Ri∗∗= [Rit∗]Ni
t=1, where Rit∗∈{0, 1}J is one-hot vector denoting the t-th item user i
interacted with. The same user i has different user embeddings at different time t, reﬂecting dynamics
in user interests; here we denote as uit ∈RD the latent user vector when user i interacts with the
t-th item in her history, and we use U = [uit]I,Nmax
i=1,t=1 ∈RI×Nmax×D (with necessary zero-padding)
to denote the collection of user latent vectors. We denote as vj ∈RD the item latent vector and
V = [vj]J
j=1RJ×D as the collection. For simplicity and without loss of generality, in this paper we
focus on using NL descriptions (i.e., a sequence of words) to describe items. For item j we denote its
NL description as xj, and the number of words as Mj; similar to V, we let X = [xj]J
j=1. With slight
notation overload on t, we denote as R(s) and R(t) the sub-tensor of R that corresponds to the source
and target domains, respectively. Similarly, we also have U(s), U(t), V(s), V(t), X(s), and X(t)."
ZERO-SHOT RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS,0.05934718100890208,"Problem Setup. A model is trained using all users’ interaction sequences from the source domain,
i.e., {Ri∗∗}i∈Us, and then deployed to recommend items for any user ι ∈Ut in the target domain,
given user ι’s previous history Rι∗∗, which can be empty. In practice we append a dummy item at the
beginning of each user session, so that during inference we could conduct recommend even for users
without any history by ingesting the dummy item as context to infer the user latent vector. In our
zero-shot setting, the model is not allowed to ﬁne-tune or retrain on any data from the target domain."

item embeddings, one can then build sequential models to obtain user embeddings by aggregating

DATASETS,0.2166172106824926,"• Amazon [26]: A publicly available dataset collection which contains a group of datasets in
different categories with abundant item metadata such as item description, product images,
etc. In our experiments, we consider two datasets: (1) ‘Prime Pantry’, which contains
300K interactions, 10K items, and 76K users, and (2) ‘Grocery and Gourmet Food’, which
contains 2.3M interactions, 213K items, and 739K users.
• MIND [37]: A large-scale news recommendation dataset collected from the user click
logs of Microsoft News. It includes 4-week user history and 5th-week interactions. In our
experiments, we simulate zero-shot learning by leave-one-out splitting on subcategories
under the largest category in MIND: ‘sports’. We consider two pairs: (1) ‘Others’ to ’NFL’,
where ‘Others’ contains all the other subcategories except ‘NFL’. ‘Others’ contains 169K
interactions, 8K items, and 57K users, while ‘NFL’ contains 1M interactions, 11K items,
and 203K users. (2) ‘Others’ to ‘NCAA’, where ‘Others’ includes all the subcategories
except ‘NCAA’. ‘Others’ contains 797K interacions, 17K items, and 206K users, while
‘NCAA’ contains 238K interactions, 31K items, and 56K users."

divided into training (80%) and test (20%) sets. For datasets in the two MIND pairs, we follow the
ofﬁcial splitting [37] and use the four-week user history as the training set and interactions in the
ﬁfth week as the test set. Due to strong recency bias in the news recommendation [37], for MIND
we run experiments under two settings to measure temporal invariance of the model: (1) evaluate
on interactions in the ﬁrst day of the week (1st-day setting), and (2) evaluate on interactions of the
whole week, i.e., the full test set (whole-week setting). For all datasets, We further split 10% of the
training set by user as validation set."

EXPERIMENT SETUP AND EVALUATION METRICS,0.3026706231454006,"Incremental Training Experiments. To measure how long it takes for non-zero-shot models to

base models GRU4Rec, TCN, HRNN as well as GRU4Rec-Meta, TCN-Meta, HRNN-Meta. Note
that the variants of our ZESREC are NOT retrained on target domain. It is also inevitable that
non-zero-shot models eventually outperform ZESREC because ZESREC does not have access to
target-domain data. Due to space constraint, we only reported results for incremental training
experiments on Amazon pair and MIND NCAA pair under the 1st-day setting. Importantly, under
the whole-week setting for the MIND dataset, the ZESRec variants already signiﬁcantly outperform
in-domain competitors which are trained on the full target training set; therefore it is meaningless
to compare incremental training results under this setting, as in-domain competitors will never beat
ZESRec variants. For all the source-target dataset pairs, we group the interactions by user and sort
interactions within each user based on interaction timestamps. We randomly select users until we get
enough interactions and build three datasets containing 2.5K, 5K, and 10K interactions, respectively."

we evaluate ZESREC) and only keep users for whom ZESREC correctly predicts the 6-th items in
the sequence given the ﬁrst 5 items as context, as we want to focus on sequences where ZESREC
works. We use these users as queries to ﬁnd users with similar behavioral patterns from the source

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS,0.4599406528189911,"Zero-Shot Experiments. The experimental results on three dataset pairs are in Table 1. Overall,
our ZESREC outperforms zero-shot baselines Embedding-KNN and Random by a large margin in
most cases; it can also achieve performance comparable to in-domain baselines. On the Amazon
pair, ZESREC beats POP and achieves comparable performance with HRNN-Meta and HRNN-
Interactions, suggesting the existence of shared recommendation patterns in two domains. For the
two MIND pairs, we made the following observations: (1) Under the whole-week setting, ZESREC
consistently outperforms HRNN-Meta and HRNN-Interactions by a large margin. Comparing the
ﬁrst-day results and the whole-week results, it is obvious that the in-domain models overﬁt the history
and fail to generalize well on latest user-item interactions. This reﬂects strong recency bias in news
recommendation. In contrast, our zero-shot learning naturally comes with an inductive bias to only
model the transition from user history to the next item. (2) Under the ﬁrst-day setting, ZESREC still
achieves reasonable performance comparing with in-domain models on both pairs. (3) Surprisingly
in the MIND NFL pair, the ZESRec variants perform well under the whole-week setting even when
the source domain contains much fewer interactions than the target domain (169K VS 1M)."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS,0.4629080118694362,"Incremental Training Experiments. Incremental training results are in Fig. 2. Overall, almost all
the in-domain baselines are not able to outperform ZESREC by retraining on at most 10K interactions
in target domain, which shows the vast importance of conducting zero-shot learning in recommender
domain. For new business operating an early-stage RecSys, it’s hard to train a good RecSys with
limited interactions. This is a chicken-and-egg problem, as training good RecSys requires sufﬁcient
interactions, while in turn, collecting sufﬁcient interactions requires a satisfactory RecSys to attract
users. Therefore the ﬁrst 10K interactions are crucial to get the RecSys started."

tea. This case study demonstrates ZESREC can learn the user behavioral pattern that ‘users who
bought sugary snacks and tea tend to buy caffeine-free herbal tea later’. More interestingly, another
case study in Fig. 4 demonstrates that ZESREC can learn the user behavioral pattern that ‘if users
bought snacks or drinks that they like, they may later purchase similar snacks or drinks with different
ﬂavors’. Speciﬁcally, in the source domain, the user purchased ‘Vita Coconut Water’ with four
different ﬂavors; such a pattern is captured by ZESREC. Later in the target domain, an unseen user
purchase ‘V8 Splash’ with a tropical ﬂavor, ZESREC then successfully recommends ‘V8 Splash’
with a berry ﬂavor to the user."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5727002967359051,"In this paper, we identify the problem of zero-shot recommender systems where a model is trained
in the source domain and deployed in a target domain where all the users and items are unseen
during training. We propose ZESREC as the ﬁrst general framework for addressing this problem.
We introduce the notion of universal continuous identiﬁers leveraging the fact that item ID can be
grounded in natural-language descriptions. We provide empirical results, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ZESREC and verify that ZESREC
can successfully learn user behavioral patterns that generalize across datasets (domains). The main
limitation of this work is that commonality between domains is crucial for ZESRec, as is the case
for most other works in transfer learning. Future work includes quantiﬁcation of such commonality
and exploring other modalities, e.g., images and videos, as alternative universal identiﬁers. It would
also be interesting to investigate the interpretability provided by the pretrained BERT model and to
incorporate additional auxiliary information to further improve the zero-shot performance."

with a learning rate of 0.1, and train ZESREC variants in the source domain with early stopping
based on validation loss. We set the hyperparameter λv as a relatively large value 100 to restrain the
variance of the item offset vector ϵj."

feedback (interactions between user and item).
Since we are considering session-based recom-

out users with only 1 interaction as the sequen-

user history as context to perform next-step pre-
diction."

ous experimental setup for zero-shot learning:
Firstly, we makes sure that there are no overlap-

and the target domain. Secondly, we temporally
split the two domains, meaning that all the train-
ing interactions in the source domain must be
happened before all the testing interactions in the target domain."

-LAYER NN,0.9910979228486647,"The graphical model for ZESREC is shown in Fig. 5. In the MAP estimation version of ZES-
REC, we set λu →∞to remove latent user offset vector, thereby preventing ZESREC from
over-parameterization. Fig. 6 shows a simpliﬁed deterministic model architecture from the neural
network point of view. Below we elaborate on the process in terms of two stages: training in source
domain and inference in target domain."
-LAYER NN,0.9940652818991098,"Training in Source Domain. During training, on the encoder side, we generate BERT embeddings
from items’ NL descriptions as item universal embeddings and then add the learnable item offset
vectors to them, which yield the ﬁnal item embeddings (item latent vectors). The sequential model
will aggregate item embeddings of items in user history to generate user embeddings. On the decoder
side, we compute item latent vectors the same way we do on the encoder side. Here we share item
latent vectors on both encoder and decoder sides to reduce number of parameters. Empirically we
ﬁnd this prevent overﬁtting and improve performance."
-LAYER NN,0.9970326409495549,"Inference in Target Domain. In this phase, we will remove the item offset vectors on both the
encoder and decoder sides. We use item universal embeddings directly instead as the ﬁnal item latent
vectors since we have no access to interactions in the target domain, and therefore the model is unable
to estimate the item offset vectors."
