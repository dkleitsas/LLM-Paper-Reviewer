ABSTRACT,0.002770083102493075,"The recent success of autoencoders for representation learning can be traced in
large part to the addition of a regularization term. Such regularized autoencoders
“constrain” the representation so as to prevent overfitting to the data while pro-
ducing a parsimonious generative model. A regularized autoencoder should in
principle learn not only the data manifold, but also a set of geometry-preserving
coordinates for the latent representation space; by geometry-preserving we mean
that the latent space representation should attempt to preserve actual distances
and angles on the data manifold. In this paper we first formulate a hierarchy for
geometry-preserving mappings (isometry, conformal mapping of degree k, area-
preserving mappings). We then show that a conformal regularization term of de-
gree zero – i.e., one that attempts to preserve angles and relative distances, instead
of angles and exact distances – produces data representations that are superior to
other existing methods. Applying our algorithm to an unsupervised information
retrieval task for CelebA data with 40 annotations, we achieve 79% precision at
five retrieved images, an improvement of more than 10% compared to recent re-
lated work. Code is available at https://github.com/Gabe-YHLee/IRVAE-public."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.008310249307479225,"Learning a good representation for high-dimensional data is one of the most fundamental problems
in machine learning. A good representation should capture all essential information about the data in
a parsimonious manner while filtering out all non-essential variations. Clearly what is “essential” or
“non-essential” depends heavily on the end task (Tschannen et al., 2018), and numerous criteria have
been proposed for a range of contexts, e.g., disentanglement (Higgins et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017),
clustering (Makhzani et al., 2015), sparsity (Lewicki & Sejnowski, 2000), hierarchy (Gulrajani et al.,
2017), and isometric embedding (McQueen et al., 2016; Peterfreund et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.0110803324099723,"In this paper we take the view that the essential information is best captured by the geometry of
the data. More specifically, we adopt the manifold hypothesis as our point of departure, and further
argue that a good representation should also preserve the geometry of the data manifold. That is,
nearby points on the manifold should have representations in the latent representation space that
are also nearby, and angles and volumes should be preserved as much as possible when moving
between the data manifold and its representation space. To find such a representation, it is important
to (i) learn the correct low-dimensional data manifold, and (ii) to find an optimal set of latent space
coordinates that preserves the geometry of the learned data manifold."
INTRODUCTION,0.013850415512465374,"A primary reason that autoencoders are widely used for unsupervised representation learning is
that they can learn both the manifold and the latent space coordinates simultaneously during the
training phase. Vanilla autoencoders trained purely to minimize reconstruction loss tend to overfit,
and the learned manifolds are often inaccurate. As demonstrated in (Rifai et al., 2011b; Kingma
& Welling, 2014; Makhzani et al., 2015; Tolstikhin et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2021), by augmenting
the reconstruction loss with a regularization term, manifold learning performance of autoencoders
can be significantly enhanced. However, little if any consideration has been given to the concurrent
problem of learning a set of latent space coordinates that preserves the geometry of the data manifold
(with the exception of FMVAE (Chen et al., 2020), which we discuss further below)."
INTRODUCTION,0.01662049861495845,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
INTRODUCTION,0.019390581717451522,"The main contribution of this paper is a regularized autoencoder that simultaneously learns the
data manifold and a geometry-preserving set of latent space coordinates. For this purpose, we first
formulate a hierarchy of geometry-preserving mappings. At the top of the hierarchy are isometries,
which preserve distances and angles, followed by conformal maps, which preserve angles, and then
area-preserving maps. Of particular relevance to this paper are the conformal maps, which we further
stratify into degree k conformal maps, with k = 0 corresponding to scaled isometries, i.e., maps
that preserve angles and distances up to some scale factor."
INTRODUCTION,0.0221606648199446,"Based on this hierarchy of mappings, we then formulate a corresponding hierarchy of regularization
criteria for training the autoencoder. One of the important findings of our study is that somewhat
counterintuitively, using a regularization term that measures the nearness to an isometry is in fact
detrimental; such a regularization term overly constrains the mapping, resulting in a higher recon-
struction loss whose effects cannot be mitigated even with adjustments to the regularization term
weight. Rather, using a less stringent regularization term is more helpful. In our examples the degree
zero conformal maps, or scaled isometries, seem to offer the best balance between reconstruction
accuracy and model parsimony."
INTRODUCTION,0.024930747922437674,"We note that if the exact data manifold were known in advance, then the scale factor could be pre-
computed, e.g., to make the latent space and the data manifold have the same volume, in which case
it would make sense to use a normalized version of the isometry measure as regularization term.
When using an autoencoder for representation learning, however, the data manifold is not known a
priori but rather learned together with the latent space representation. The more effective alternative,
we argue, is to learn this scale together with the manifold and the latent space representation. The
FMVAE of (Chen et al., 2020) is in fact the first work to adopt this approach, but the measure
does not adequately capture the nearness to a scaled isometry, and is also not coordinate-invariant,
limiting its performance as we show later in our experiments."
INTRODUCTION,0.027700831024930747,"Once the data manifold and an initial set of geometry-preserving latent space coordinates are learned,
it is possible to further “flatten” the latent space, by adding a postprocessing step that leads to an
even more isometric set of coordinates. Specifically, we use an invertible neural network model
to map the pre-trained latent space to a more isometric representation space, without incurring any
further losses in reconstruction accuracy."
INTRODUCTION,0.030470914127423823,"Experiments on diverse image and motion capture data confirm that, compared to existing related
methods, our geometrically regularized autoencoder produces more isometric representations of
the data while incurring only minimal losses in reconstruction accuracy. In particular, information
retrieval task experiments conducted with CelebA data show that data similarity measurements per-
formed in our representation space lead to significantly improved levels of retrieval performance."
INTRODUCTION,0.0332409972299169,Our specific contributions can be summarized as follows:
INTRODUCTION,0.036011080332409975,"• We define a family of coordinate-invariant regularization terms that measure how close the de-
coder is to being a scaled isometry;
• We propose an isometric regularization method for autoencoders that learns both the data mani-
fold and a set of geometry-preserving latent space coordinates, all while incurring minimal losses
in reconstruction accuracy;
• We propose a postprocessing flattening technique that learns a more isometric representation

mented by z = δz1 + (1 −δ)z2 such that zi ∼P, i = 1, 2, where δ is uniformly sampled from
[−η, 1 + η]. Sampling from the augmented latent space data distribution is denoted as z ∼PZ."

EXPERIMENTS,0.24930747922437674,"Throughout this section we use isometric regularization on VAE (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende
& Mohamed, 2015) which we refer to as the Isometrically Regularized VAE (IRVAE). We then
train the Flattening Module (FM) in a post hoc manner, which we denote by IRVAE + FM. In
Section 5.1, we show that (i) IRVAE can effectively learn the isometric representation with a minimal
loss in reconstruction accuracy compared to vanilla VAE and FMVAE (Chen et al., 2020), and (ii)
IRVAE + FM leads to a more isometric representation without any loss in reconstruction accuracy.
In Section 5.2, through an unsupervised human face retrieval task, we show that measuring data
similarity in our isometric representation spaces significantly improves retrieval performance. A
mathematical comparison of IRVAE with FMVAE is provided in Appendix C, with experimental
details given in Appendix D."

ISOMETRIC REPRESENTATION WITH MINIMAL LOSS IN RECONSTRUCTION ACCURACY"
ISOMETRIC REPRESENTATION WITH MINIMAL LOSS IN RECONSTRUCTION ACCURACY,0.2548476454293629,"We first introduce some evaluation metrics that measure (i) the accuracy of the learned manifolds,
and (ii) how isometric the latent space is (i.e., how close the pullback metric M(z) := JT
f (z)Jf(z)
is to {cI|c ∈(0, ∞)}). These metrics are computed over the test datasets."
ISOMETRIC REPRESENTATION WITH MINIMAL LOSS IN RECONSTRUCTION ACCURACY,0.25761772853185594,"The accuracy of the learned manifolds is measured in terms of the mean square reconstruction
errors. To evaluate M(z), we introduce two different metrics that are scale-invariant (i.e., M(z)
and kM(z) have the same values). First, the Variance of the Riemannian metric (VoR) is defined
as the mean square distance from M(z) to ¯
M := Ez∼PZ[M(z)], where we use the affine-invariant
Riemannian distance d, i.e., d2(A, B) = Pm
i=1(log λi(B−1A))2 (Pennec et al., 2006; Lee & Park,
2018). Second, we use the Mean Condition Number (MCN) of the Riemannian metric, where the
condition number of M(z) is the ratio between the maximum eigenvalue and minimum eigenvalue.
Both metrics are computed by sampling a sufficiently large number of points from PZ."
ISOMETRIC REPRESENTATION WITH MINIMAL LOSS IN RECONSTRUCTION ACCURACY,0.26038781163434904,"VoR measures how the Riemannian metric is spread out from ¯
M, which becomes zero when the
metric is constant for all z in the support of PZ. While VoR measures the spatial variance of the
metric in z, MCN measures how much the metric is isotropic. MCN becomes one when M(z) ∝I
for all z in the support of PZ."
ISOMETRIC REPRESENTATION WITH MINIMAL LOSS IN RECONSTRUCTION ACCURACY,0.2631578947368421,"For IRVAE and FMVAE, there are natural tradeoffs between MSE versus VoR and MCN. If we
use higher weights α for the regularization terms, the representation becomes more isometric with
losses in reconstruction accuracy. In order to compare the algorithms in a regularization coefficient
α-invariant manner, we compare the tradeoff curves, i.e., MSE as a function of VoR and MCN
obtained by using varying regularization coefficients α."

UNSUPERVISED HUMAN FACE RETRIEVAL,0.31024930747922436,"We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to image-to-image retrieval of human faces.
We consider the retrieval of face images that have a queried set of attributes, in which the query is
also given as a set of face images that share some visual attributes. For example, if a user provides a
set of photos that contain smiling faces but differ in other attributes, a retrieval algorithm is expected
to return a set of smiling face images from the database. In this setting, a user communicates with a
retrieval system by providing examples, avoiding the dependence on human language."
UNSUPERVISED HUMAN FACE RETRIEVAL,0.31301939058171746,"We focus in particular on an unsupervised scenario in which a retrieval algorithm is built without
any annotation. Unsupervised representation learning methods are trained on CelebA (Liu et al.,
2015), which contains 182,637 training images and 19,962 test images. Each image in CelebA has
64×64×3 pixels and contains an aligned human face with binary annotations on 40 attributes. The
attribute annotations are only used to evaluate retrieval performance."
UNSUPERVISED HUMAN FACE RETRIEVAL,0.3157894736842105,"We refer to attributes that query images have in common as query attributes. We experiment with
different settings in which there is a single query attribute (single attribute retrieval; SAR) and also
with two query attributes (double attribute retrieval; DAR). We use all images that have given query
attributes in the training set as query images, and retrieve the top K similar images from the test set
based on the summed cosine similarity to the query images."
UNSUPERVISED HUMAN FACE RETRIEVAL,0.3185595567867036,"The quality of a retrieval is measured using precision at K (P@K) for K = 1, 5, 10, 20. P@K denotes
the ratio of images that have query attributes among the K retrieved images. For SAR, P@K are
averaged over the 40 attributes. For DAR, there are 780 possible combinations of two attributes. We
select a combination of attributes if the images that have those attributes account for more than one
percent and less than fifty percent of the total test data; thus P@K are averaged over 487 selected

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.34349030470914127,"We have formulated the problem of learning the manifold simultaneously with a set of optimal
latent space coordinates that preserve the geometry of the learned manifold. We have introduced
a hierarchy of geometry-preserving mappings between two Riemannian manifolds (e.g., isometry,
conformal mapping of degree k, area-preserving mappings) and defined a family of coordinate-
invariant relaxed distortion measures that measure the proximity of the mapping to a scaled isometry
(i.e., conformal mapping of degree 0). Finally, two algorithms, isometric regularization and latent
space flattening, have been proposed. We have verified the efficacy of our methods with diverse
image and motion capture data, and through a human face retrieval task with CelebA data."
CONCLUSION,0.3462603878116344,"We believe the algorithm can be further enhanced in a number of different ways. The current im-
plementation of IRVAE and IRVAE + FM assumes the identity metric in the ambient data space,
i.e., H(x) = I. Although this is a reasonable choice in a fully unsupervised setting, we think that
domain-specific knowledge or a few labels can be leveraged to define better H(x). In addition, in-
stead of the mix-up data augmentation method used in this paper, developing a principled approach
for defining PZ will be an interesting future research direction."

latent value along each latent space axis, and (iii) decode the translated values back to the data
space. In case of VAE, translations along the latent space axes except z2, z6 axes do not generate
new poses. In particular, the pose changes really a lot along the z2 axis and yet just a little along the
z6 axis. This shows that the trained decoder in VAE is far from the isometry. In contrast, with the
isometric regularization in IRVAE, each translated latent value along each latent space axis generates
a different pose. Unlike VAE, diverse poses are generated, and in other words, a more disentangled
representation is obtained. This property of the isometric decoder has a great advantage (Bengio

un-isotropic red ellipses in regions between data points, meaning that they are not isometrically reg-
ularized. Mixup augmentation makes it possible to regularize even regions between data. When the
mixup parameter η = 0, only the area covered by data interpolation is regularized. By increasing
the mixup parameter η, the outer area, which is covered by data extrapolation, begins to be reg-
ularized. Although using bigger eta seems to be unconditionally good because the wider area is
regularized, there is indeed a tradeoff as we can see from Figure 9. When the mixup parameter is
too big as η = 1, some inner area (i.e., area covered by data interpolation) is not sufficiently regu-
larized because of the cost of regularizing the outer domain. We use a balanced value η = 0.2 for
all experiments conducted in this paper (for all algorithms IRVAE, FM and FMVAE)."

scales so that the two spaces have the same scales? – but the reason this difference is consequential
for our problem is that we do not a priori have a precise charcterization (and hence their relative
scales) of the two spaces. We are in effect discovering the manifold structure of the data space while
constructing a latent space representation for the data manifold at the same time."

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE LATENT SPACE DIMENSION"

tribution (Levina & Bickel, 2005), given a complex high-dimensional data, the intrinsic dimension
estimation problem is very challenging; in practice, an appropriate value is often found, empiri-
cally. Throughout literature, there are some frequently-used choices for well-known standard image
datasets. For relatively simple datasets such the MNIST and FMNIST, latent space dimensions 2 ∼
32 are often used, and for more complex and higher dimensional datasets such as the CIFAR10 and
CELEBA, latent dimensions 64 ∼512 are often used."
