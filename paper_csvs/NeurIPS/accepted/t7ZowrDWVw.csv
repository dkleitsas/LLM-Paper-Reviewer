ABSTRACT,0.005649717514124294,Abstract
ABSTRACT,0.011299435028248588,"This paper introduces a novel task called Cross Modal Generalization (CMG),
which addresses the challenge of learning a unified discrete representation from
paired multimodal data during pre-training. Then in downstream tasks, the model
can achieve zero-shot generalization ability in other modalities when only one
modal is labeled. Existing approaches in multimodal representation learning fo-
cus more on coarse-grained alignment or rely on the assumption that information
from different modalities is completely aligned, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Uni-Code, which contains
two key contributions: the Dual Cross-modal Information Disentangling (DCID)
module and the Multi-Modal Exponential Moving Average (MM-EMA). These
methods facilitate bidirectional supervision between modalities and align semanti-
cally equivalent information in a shared discrete latent space, enabling fine-grained
unified representation of multimodal sequences. During pre-training, we investi-
gate various modality combinations, including audio-visual, audio-text, and the
tri-modal combination of audio-visual-text. Extensive experiments on various
downstream tasks, i.e., cross-modal event classification, localization, cross-modal
retrieval, query-based video segmentation, and cross-dataset event localization,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The code is available at
https://github.com/haihuangcode/CMG."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.022598870056497175,"Although recent years have witnessed significant achievements in many multimodal areas, e.g.,
multi-modality question-answering [1, 2, 3], query-based segmentation [4, 5], audio-visual event
localization [6, 7], labeling these tasks always consumes extensive human resources. Moreover,
the labeling cost for different modalities can vary significantly [8], leading to scenarios where
only a subset of modalities is labeled, while others remain scarce [9]. For example, text-based
visual segmentation is common while the label data for audio-based visual segmentation is rare.
Consequently, models trained on such limited data are restricted to specific scenarios, hindering their
broader applicability. Fortunately, unannotated paired multimodal data is readily accessible, such
as the abundant image-caption [10] and audio-visual pairs [11] available on the Internet. Hence, in
this paper, we develop a new task, Cross-Modal Generalization (CMG), for investigating how to
learn unified discrete representations from these unlabelled multi-modal data pairs. Our objective is
to transfer the knowledge acquired from labeled modalities to other unseen modalities in downstream
tasks, enabling models to generalize effectively."

INTRODUCTION,0.11864406779661017,"Humans possess a natural ability to associate different modalities with similar semantics, facilitating
cross-modal knowledge transfer based on known modalities. Inspired by this, numerous studies have
explored the integration of diverse multimodal information into a unified semantic space, which
can be categorized into two types: implicit representations [12, 13, 14] and explicit representations
[15, 16, 17]. For implicit representations, several methods utilize a modality-agnostic encoder [12, 13]
to represent different modalities, or employ contrastive learning [18, 19] to bring different modalities
closer in high-dimensional semantic space. In contrast, explicit representations aim to use a unified
codebook [17] or prototype [16] to represent different modalities, serving as a bridge to facilitate
robust alignment across modalities. Furthermore, the use of discrete space allows for the aggregation
of similar input features in a high-dimensional space, enabling complex feature representation with a
reduced number of latent codes. However, these studies predominantly compress sequential features
within modalities into single vectors before quantization [16, 20] or rely on the assumption that
information from different modalities is completely aligned [17, 21]. As a result, these methods are
typically limited to simple tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and demonstrate poor performance in
more complex scenarios."
INTRODUCTION,0.12429378531073447,"As shown in Fig 1, the visual information in unconstrained videos comprises events of cat meowing
and dog barking, while the audio information comprises events of woman speaking and dog barking.
Directly applying previous methods [13, 17, 16, 20] would lead to inaccurate mapping of multimodal
information lacking shared semantics. To address this limitation, our paper primarily focuses on
the implementation of a fine-grained, unified representation for multimodal sequences. We address
this novel problem from two key aspects: 1) extracting information with identical semantics across
different modalities while mitigating the influence of modality-specific details, and 2) representing
these diverse modalities with shared semantics using a unified codebook. Most of the previous works
primarily focus on the second aspect while neglecting the importance of the first aspect, which we
argue is crucial for achieving cross-modal generalization."
INTRODUCTION,0.12994350282485875,"Our work builds upon the advantages of explicit representations and proposes two modules to address
the aforementioned challenges. To address the first aspect, we propose Dual Cross-modal Information
Disentangling (DCID) module, which combines Contrastive Log-ratio Upper Bound (CLUB) [22]
with our proposed Cross-modal Contrastive Predictive Coding [23] (Cross-CPC). Concretely, we
employ CLUB to optimize the upper bound of mutual information, efficiently distinguishing the
modal-agnostic semantic information (conveying primary content or events) from the modal-specific
information (additional details unrelated to semantics, such as light and perspective in vision, or
timbre and pitch in audio, etc.) across various modalities. However, without effective guidance,
it is challenging for the model to identify which aspects of semantic information are useful [24].
Motivated by the complementary guidance nature of multi-modal information [25], we propose a
novel Cross-CPC method, to predict the future information in other modalities based on the known
sequence information of the current modality, which can effectively maximize the fine-grained mutual
information between different modalities. To address the second aspects, we propose Multi-Modal
Exponential Moving Average (MM-EMA), which employs a teacher-student mechanism to facilitate"
INTRODUCTION,0.13559322033898305,"cross-modal guidance during pretraining. This mechanism encourages the aggregation of quantized
vectors encoded from different modalities with shared semantics into the same latent code space.
Otherwise, distinct modalities would aggregate in separate regions of the discrete space, rather than
being mapped together [20, 17]. To summarize, our main contributions are threefold:"

Related Work"
RELATED WORK,0.1638418079096045,"Implicit Multi-Modal Unified Representation. The past few years have witnessed remarkable
achievements in the implicit multi-modal unified representation, which aims to align diverse modali-
ties within a shared latent space [26, 27, 14] or try to learn a modality-agnostic encoder for extracting
information across various modal [28, 29]. These methods investigate the unified representation for
various modality combinations, i.e., Speech-Text [26, 30], Video-Audio [31, 32, 27, 33], Vision-Text
[18, 14, 29]. To achieve these, different kinds of methods have been proposed. Pedersoli et al. [31]
and Sarkar et al. [27] introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge across
modalities. CLIP-based methods [18, 14] use contrastive loss to learn image-text consistency from a
large paired dataset, and have gained incredible zero-shot ability in various downstream tasks."
RELATED WORK,0.1694915254237288,"Explicit Multi-Modal Unified Representation. Recently, some works investigate how to achieve
multimodal explicit unified representation by utilizing a universal codebook [15, 17, 20] or prototype
[16] to explicitly express multimodal content. Duan et al. [16] apply Optimal Transport to map
the feature vectors extracted from different modalities to the prototypes. Zhao et al. [20] use self-
cross-reconstruction to enhance the mutual information between different modals. However, these
coarse-grained alignment methods [16, 20] are only suitable for simple tasks such as retrieval, and
are unable to accomplish fine-grained comprehension in downstream tasks. In recent years, [34, 21]
align the text and speech temporally with a unified discrete space. Liu et al. [17] use the same scheme
to align short videos and speech/text. However, a key assumption underlying their success is that
the modalities they chose have a one-to-one alignment (i.e. text-to-speech), while in more general
case, it is hard to guarantee the semantic information in the two paired modalities is completely
consistent (i.e. unconstrained video and audio). In this paper, we mainly investigate how to map a
paired multimodal sequence into a common discrete semantic space, where the information in the
multimodal sequence is unconstrained and may not be perfectly aligned."
RELATED WORK,0.1751412429378531,"Mutual Information Estimation. Mutual information (MI) estimation aims to measure the depen-
dence between two random variables. Recent works primarily concentrate on how to combine MI
estimation with deep neural networks [35, 22, 23], including MI maximization and minimization. MI
maximization aims to learn representations that capture meaningful and useful information about the
input data, leading to improved performance in various downstream tasks [36, 37, 38]. In order to
maximize mutual information in a sequence, Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) [23] employs an
autoregressive model and contrastive estimation to capture long-term relations while maintaining
local features within a sequence. MI minimization tries to reduce the dependency between two
random variables while preserving the relevant information, has been successfully applied in disen-
tangled representation learning [39, 24]. Belghaz et al. [35] propose a Mutual Information Neural
Estimator (MINE), which builds a neural network to estimate mutual information based on dual
representations of the KL-divergence [40, 41]. Chen et al. [22] introduce Contrastive Log-ratio Upper
Bound (CLUB), combining MI estimation with contrastive learning to approximate the MI upper
bound. Their work is more suitable for MI minimization."

direct maps, we argue that the success of unified representation lies in the extraction of modality-

introduce a DCID module, designed to extract fine-grained semantic information and separate it from
the corresponding modality-specific information within each modality. Second, we compress the
extracted semantic features into discrete variables through VQ-VAE, ensuring that the compressed
discrete variables can still contain the original semantic information through reconstruction loss. For
simplicity, we take two modalities as an example to illustrate the process. Fig 2 gives an overview

DATASETS AND TASKS,0.519774011299435,"Downstream: we evaluate the pre-trained models on several downstream tasks using different
datasets: Cross-modal event classification (AVE [46]): In AVE, each video contains a primary
event that is present in both audio and visual information. Therefore, we can train an event classifier
using a single modality (e.g., video) and directly evaluate the classifier’s performance on another
modality (e.g., audio). Cross-modal event localization (AVVP [47]): In AVVP, a portion of the
data is annotated with fine-grained event labels for both audio and visual modalities. Similar to
AVE, we can perform event localization on one modality and then directly transfer the model to the
other modality for testing. Cross both modal and dataset localization/classification: In order to
prove that our model can also achieve cross-modal transfer on different downstream datasets, we use
classification tasks for one modality in AVE to train, and directly test fine-grained event localization
ability of the model on another modality in AVVP (from AVE to AVVP). Also we test the cross-modal
classification tasks between the visual modality in part of UCF-101 (16 classes) and audio modality
in part of VGGSound-AVEL (16 classes). Cross-modal video segmentation (AVSBench-S4 [48]):
In AVS, each piece of AVS data contains a piece of audio, a video clip of the object that emits the
sound, a text label corresponding to the object, and a manually labeled mask. We expand each text
label into a descriptive sentence. We use one modality (e.g., audio) to train the query-based video
segmentation, and directly test the segmentation ability in another modality (e.g., text). Cross-modal
retrieval (VGGSound-AVEL) We select retrieval task to demonstrate that our method can also
be applied to visual-text generalization as well. We use audio as an inter-medium to measure the
generalization ability of our model across these two modalities and implement an X-to-audio retrieval
task. To be detailed, in the first stage, we train visual-text unified representation learning using
VGGSound24K dataset, and then in the second stage, during downstream training, we let the model
learn text(video)-audio retrieval, finally during inference, we directly test the generalization ability of
the model on video(text)-audio retrieval."

COMPARED WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS,0.5706214689265536,"We mainly compare our model with these leading methods on two downstream tasks, cross-modal
event classification and localization, all these models are pre-trained using audio-visual modalities
on three different sizes of datasets. As we can see in Table 1, our methods can outperform all these
previous works on three settings. The baseline results indicate that without any constraints, it is
challenging for the model to learn the alignment relationship between different modalities during
pre-training, leading to poor performance in downstream tasks. Moreover, the experiment results also
demonstrate that merely employing these state-of-the-art methods in such unconstrained audio-visual
alignment has considerable limitations. However, when incorporated with our proposed DCID
module, these models exhibit substantial improvements in downstream tasks. This further suggests
that our proposed DCID can effectively decouple the semantic information of different modalities."
COMPARED WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS,0.576271186440678,"In addition, we can observe from Table 1 that when the scale of pre-training data increases from 24K
to 40K, there is a significant improvement in the performance of the model on downstream tasks.
However, when the scale reaches 81K, the performance of the model does not improve much and
even declines. This also indicates that excessive pre-training data may not yield desirable results,
only an appropriate amount of data can enable the model to learn the correct alignment relationships."

than that of removing CLUB, which indicates that without the fine-grained cross-modal alignment

ABLATION STUDIES,0.5932203389830508,"information from the original modal features. When MM-EMA is removed, the model performance
also declines significantly, demonstrating that MM-EMA can effectively utilize the Cross-Attention
mechanism between different modalities to gradually map the relevant information together, helping
to achieve a unified representation. The experimental results of removing the ""reset code"" indicate
that this module can effectively remove the redundancy latent codes caused by MM-EMA."
ABLATION STUDIES,0.5988700564971752,"The Effect of Codebook Size Different codebook sizes may affect the effectiveness of modality
aggregation, thereby influencing the performance of downstream cross-modal generalization tasks.
Here we investigate how the size of codebook influences pre-training performance. From Fig 3, we
can see that the appropriate codebook size can achieve the best pre-training performance, while too
large size (which may cause signals from different modalities to aggregate at different positions in the
codebook) and too small size (where semantically distinct signals are erroneously mapped together
due to limited capacity) will both degrade the performance of pre-trained models."
ABLATION STUDIES,0.6045197740112994,"Unified Representation of Three Modalities Compared with previous works that can only align
two modalities together, our method can disentangle and align the semantic information of three
modalities, as shown in Table 3. From the results we can see that the removal of these modules will
lead to a decline in the performance of the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, similar to the
results in Table 2. However, compared to the unified representation of the two modalities, the removal
of these modules leads to a smaller decline in the model performance. We think the reason is that the
introduction of the third modality can facilitate the other two modalities approaching each other, and
the performance of the model pre-trained on three modalities is significantly higher than that of the
model pre-trained on two, which also illustrate this point."

can accurately identify vocal regions in video frames for unknown modalities. Furthermore, the
performance of our method is closer to the evaluation results of the AVS model on source modality.

the same discrete code, which also proves why the baseline performs poorly in downstream tasks.
The CMCM [17] method can effectively alleviate this problem, but there are still many codes that

Conclusion and Discussion"
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION,0.6949152542372882,"In this paper, we propose a new Cross Modal Generalization task, and bring up two innotative
modules, DCID and MM-EMA, which can achieve multi-modal unified representation. We achieve
unified representation of different multi-modal combinations, including audio-visual, audio-text
and audio-visual-text. Also, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks. The
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Furthermore, our
model can help existing models to extend into other modalities, achieving more extensive applications.
Limitations and Boarder Impact: In our work we only focus on the unified representation of three
modalities. However, our method can inspire future works to explore the combination of more
modalities. Our work do not contain potential negative social impact."
