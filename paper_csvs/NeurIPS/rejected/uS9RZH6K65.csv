44"
INTRODUCTION,0.05643564356435644,"To spur the community to deal with the noisy OVAR task, being necessary and practical, this paper
45"
INTRODUCTION,0.05742574257425743,"bravely faces the challenges. One vanilla idea is using a separate language model (e.g., GPT [1]) to
46"

47"
INTRODUCTION,0.0594059405940594,"However, there exist two nettlesome issues. 1) Textual Ambiguity. One text description is usually a few
48"
INTRODUCTION,0.060396039603960394,"compact words, with vague semantics, e.g., for the noisy text “boird”, there could be multiple cleaned
49"
INTRODUCTION,0.061386138613861385,"candidates in terms of spelling, such as “bird” and “board”. This short text lacks context, making
50"
INTRODUCTION,0.062376237623762376,"phrase correction difficult for uni-modal language models. 2) Cascaded Errors. Text correction and
51"
INTRODUCTION,0.06336633663366337,"action recognition are independently completed, without sharing knowledge. The noisy output of
52"
INTRODUCTION,0.06435643564356436,"text correction is cascaded to the input of action recognition, resulting in continuous propagation of
53"
INTRODUCTION,0.06534653465346535,"errors. To address these issues, we design one multi-modal robust framework: DENOISER.
54"
INTRODUCTION,0.06633663366336634,"Our first insight is to treat denoising of text descriptions as one generative task: given noisy text

56"

57"
INTRODUCTION,0.06930693069306931,"weighting. We first propose potential text candidates based on spelling similarity to limit the decoding
58"

59"
INTRODUCTION,0.07128712871287128,"weighting uses assigned visual samples to vote; while intra-modal weighting relies solely on text
60"
INTRODUCTION,0.07227722772277227,"information. Our other insight is employing existing OVAR models as off-the-shelf tools to assign
61"
INTRODUCTION,0.07326732673267326,"visual samples at discriminative step. Such tools have been proven to handle clean OVAR tasks well,
62"
INTRODUCTION,0.07425742574257425,"also making our framework easier to adapt to previous models. For full usage of information in

64"
INTRODUCTION,0.07623762376237624,"compact text descriptions. To further avoid cascaded errors, we propose a solution of alternating
65"
INTRODUCTION,0.07722772277227723,"iterations, to connect generative and discriminative steps. By progressive refinement, denoised text
66"
