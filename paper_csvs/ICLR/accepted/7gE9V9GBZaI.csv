ABSTRACT,0.0029585798816568047,"Deep learning models have a propensity for ﬁtting the entire training set even with
random labels, which requires memorization of every training sample. In this pa-
per, we explore the memorization effect in adversarial training (AT) for promoting
a deeper understanding of model capacity, convergence, generalization, and espe-
cially robust overﬁtting of the adversarially trained models. We ﬁrst demonstrate
that deep networks have sufﬁcient capacity to memorize adversarial examples of
training data with completely random labels, but not all AT algorithms can con-
verge under the extreme circumstance. Our study of AT with random labels mo-
tivates further analyses on the convergence and generalization of AT. We ﬁnd that
some AT approaches suffer from a gradient instability issue and most recently sug-
gested complexity measures cannot explain robust generalization by considering
models trained on random labels. Furthermore, we identify a signiﬁcant drawback
of memorization in AT that it could result in robust overﬁtting. We then propose a
new mitigation algorithm motivated by detailed memorization analyses. Extensive
experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.008875739644970414,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) usually exhibit excellent generalization ability in pattern recognition
tasks, despite their sufﬁcient capacity to overﬁt or memorize the entire training set with completely
random labels (Zhang et al., 2017). The memorization behavior in deep learning has aroused tremen-
dous attention to identifying the differences between learning on true and random labels (Arpit et al.,
2017; Neyshabur et al., 2017), and examining what and why DNNs memorize (Feldman, 2020; Feld-
man & Zhang, 2020; Maennel et al., 2020). This phenomenon has also motivated a growing body
of works on model capacity (Arpit et al., 2017; Belkin et al., 2019), convergence (Allen-Zhu et al.,
2019; Du et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2020), and generalization (Neyshabur et al., 2017; Bartlett et al.,
2017), which consequently provide a better understanding of the DNN working mechanism."
INTRODUCTION,0.011834319526627219,"In this paper, we explore the memorization behavior for a different learning algorithm—adversarial
training (AT). Owing to the security threat of adversarial examples, i.e., maliciously generated in-
puts by adding imperceptible perturbations to cause misclassiﬁcation (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfel-
low et al., 2015), various defense methods have been proposed to improve the adversarial robustness
of DNNs (Kurakin et al., 2017; Madry et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2018; Wong & Kolter, 2018; Cohen
et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019b; Pang et al., 2019; 2020; Dong et al., 2020a). AT is arguably the
most effective defense technique (Athalye et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2020b), in which the network is
trained on the adversarially augmented samples instead of the natural ones (Madry et al., 2018)."
INTRODUCTION,0.014792899408284023,"Despite the popularity, the memorization behavior in AT is less explored. Schmidt et al. (2018) show
that a model is able to fully (over)ﬁt the training set against an adversary, i.e., reaching almost 100%
robust training accuracy, while the performance on test data is much inferior, witnessing a signiﬁcant
generalization gap. The overﬁtting phenomenon in AT is further investigated in Rice et al. (2020).
However, it is not clear whether DNNs could memorize adversarial examples of training data with
completely random labels. Answering this question could help to examine the effects of memo-
rization in AT under the “extreme” circumstance and facilitate a deeper understanding of capacity,
convergence, generalization, and robust overﬁtting of the adversarially trained models. In general, it"

tails a much more complicated decision boundary, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Even though the networks
have sufﬁcient capacity, AT may not necessarily converge. Therefore, we aim to comprehensively
study this problem and explore how the analysis can motivate better algorithms."
INTRODUCTION,0.03254437869822485,"Our contributions. We ﬁrst empirically investigate the memorization behavior in AT by perform-
ing PGD-AT (Madry et al., 2018) and TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019b) with random labels sampled
uniformly over all classes. Different from standard training (ST) that can easily memorize random
labels (Zhang et al., 2017), AT may fail to converge, with PGD-AT being a typical example. Never-
theless, TRADES can converge under this circumstance. It demonstrates that DNNs have sufﬁcient
capacity to memorize adversarial examples of training data with completely random labels. This
phenomenon is commonly observed on multiple datasets, network architectures, and threat models."
INTRODUCTION,0.03550295857988166,"The memorization analysis has further implications for understanding the convergence and gener-
alization of AT. We conduct a convergence analysis on gradient magnitude and stability to explain
the counter-intuitive different convergence properties of PGD-AT and TRADES with random la-
bels since they behave similarly when trained on true labels (Rice et al., 2020). We corroborate that
PGD-AT suffers from a gradient instability issue while the gradients of TRADES are relatively stable
thanks to its adversarial loss. Moreover, by considering models trained on random labels, our gen-
eralization analysis indicates that several recently suggested complexity measures are inadequate to
explain robust generalization, which is complementary to the ﬁndings in ST (Neyshabur et al., 2017).
Accordingly, an appropriate explanation of robust generalization remains largely under-addressed."
INTRODUCTION,0.038461538461538464,"Lastly, but most importantly, we identify a signiﬁcant drawback of memorization in AT that it could
result in robust overﬁtting (Rice et al., 2020). We argue that the cause of robust overﬁtting lies in the
memorization of one-hot labels in the typical AT methods. The one-hot labels can be inappropriate
or even noisy for some adversarial examples because some data naturally lies close to the decision
boundary, and the corresponding adversarial examples should be assigned low predictive conﬁdence
(Stutz et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2020). To solve this problem, we propose a new mitigation algorithm
that impedes over-conﬁdent predictions by regularization for avoiding the excessive memorization of
adversarial examples with possibly noisy labels. Experiments validate that our method can eliminate
robust overﬁtting to a large extent across multiple datasets, network architectures, threat models, and
AT methods, achieving better robustness under a variety of adversarial attacks than the baselines."

learning, convergence of training has been analyzed in the over-parameterized setting (Allen-Zhu

2009) with a Wide ResNet model (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) of depth 28 and widen factor 10
(WRN-28-10). Similar to Zhang et al. (2017), we train a network on the original dataset with true
labels and on a copy of the dataset in which the true labels are corrupted by random ones. For training
and robustness evaluation, a 10-step ℓ∞PGD adversary with ϵ = 8/255 and α = 2/255 is adopted.
For TRADES, the PGD adversary maximizes the KL divergence during training, while maximizes
the cross-entropy loss for robustness evaluation, as common practice (Zhang et al., 2019b). We set
β = 6.0. In the sequel, we denote accuracy of a classiﬁer against the 10-step PGD adversary as
“robust accuracy”, and accuracy on natural examples as “natural accuracy”."

experiments to analyze each training factor individually, including network architecture, attack steps,
optimizer, and perturbation budget. We ﬁnd that tuning the training settings cannot make PGD-AT
converge with random labels (Appendix A.2 details the results). Based on the analysis, we think that
the convergence issue of PGD-AT could be a result of the adversarial loss function in Eq. (1) rather
than other training conﬁgurations. Speciﬁcally, TRADES in Eq. (3) minimizes a clean cross-entropy
(CE) loss on natural examples, making DNNs memorize natural examples with random labels before
ﬁtting adversarial examples. As seen in Fig. 2(b), at the very early stage of TRADES training (the
ﬁrst 25 epochs), the natural accuracy starts to increase while the robust accuracy does not. However,
PGD-AT in Eq. (1) directly minimizes the CE loss on adversarial samples with random labels, which
can introduce unstable gradients with large variance, making it fail to converge. To corroborate the
above argument, we analyze the gradient magnitude and stability below."

indicates that the gradient of the adversarial loss J (x, y, θ) of PGD-AT will change more dramati-
cally than that of the clean CE loss L(fθ(x), y). When θ1 and θ2 are close, the difference between
the gradients of L at θ1 and θ2 is close to 0 due to the semi-smoothness of over-parameterized
DNNs (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019), but that of J is relatively large due to 2ϵK in Eq. (5). To validate
this, we visualize the change of gradient when moving the parameters θ along a random direction
d with magnitude λ. In particular, we set θ as initialization, d is sampled from a Gaussian distri-
bution and normalized ﬁlter-wise (Li et al., 2018). For PGD-AT and TRADES, we craft adversarial
examples on-the-ﬂy for the model with θ + λd and measure the change of gradient by the ℓ2 dis-
tance to gradient at θ averaged over all data samples. The curves on gradient change of PGD-AT,
TRADES, and the clean CE loss are shown in Fig. 4(a). In a small neighborhood of θ (i.e., small
λ), the gradient of PGD-AT changes abruptly while the gradients of TRADES and the clean CE loss
are more continuous. The gradient instability leads to a lower cosine similarity between the gradient
directions w.r.t. the same data in each two successive training epochs of PGD-AT, as illustrated in
Fig. 4(b). Therefore, the training of PGD-AT would be rather unstable that the gradient exhibits
large variance, making it fail to converge."

of generalization in ST (Zhang et al., 2017; Arpit et al., 2017) and AT (see Appendix A.3), people
resort to complexity measures of a model to explain generalization (i.e., a lower complexity should
imply a smaller generalization gap). Here we show how the recently proposed complexity measures
fail to explain robust generalization when comparing models trained on true and random labels."

of neural networks (Cisse et al., 2017). The ℓ1 norm is adopted to reduce the robust generalization
gap (Yin et al., 2018). The sharpness/ﬂatness-based measures include the curvature of input loss
landscape (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2019) as the dominant eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix, as well
as the ﬂatness of weight loss landscape (Wu et al., 2020) related to the change of adversarial loss
when moving the weights along a random direction. Fig. 6 plots the four complexity measures w.r.t.
robust generalization gap of several models trained with various combinations of regularizations
on true or random labels. The results show that the ﬁrst three measures can hardly ensure robust
generalization, that lower complexity does not necessarily imply smaller robust generalization gap,
e.g., the models trained on random labels can even lead to lower complexity than those trained on
true labels. Among them, the ﬂatness of weight loss landscape (Wu et al., 2020) is more reliable."
GENERALIZATION ANALYSIS OF AT WITH RANDOM LABELS,0.20118343195266272,"In summary, the generalization analysis indicates that the previous approaches, especially various
complexity measures, cannot adequately explain and ensure the robust generalization performance in
AT. Our ﬁnding of robust generalization in AT is complementary to that of standard generalization in
ST (Zhang et al., 2017; Neyshabur et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2020). Accordingly, robust generalization
of adversarially trained models remains an open problem for future research."

ROBUST OVERFITTING ANALYSIS"
ROBUST OVERFITTING ANALYSIS,0.20710059171597633,"Rice et al. (2020) have identiﬁed robust overﬁtting as a dominant phenomenon in AT, i.e., shortly
after the ﬁrst learning rate decay, further training will continue to decrease the robust test accuracy.
They further show that several remedies for overﬁtting, including explicit ℓ1 and ℓ2 regularizations,
data augmentation, etc., cannot gain improvements upon early stopping. Although robust overﬁtting
has been thoroughly investigated, there still lacks an explanation of why it occurs. In this section, we
draw a connection between memorization and robust overﬁtting in AT by showing that robust over-
ﬁtting is caused by excessive memorization of one-hot labels in the typical AT methods. Motivated
by the analysis, we then propose an effective strategy to eliminate robust overﬁtting."

EXPLAINING ROBUST OVERFITTING"
EXPLAINING ROBUST OVERFITTING,0.22189349112426035,"The typical AT approaches (e.g., PGD-AT, TRADES) commonly adopt one-hot labels as the targets
for training, as introduced in Sec. 2.1. The one-hot labels could be inappropriate for some adversarial
examples because it is difﬁcult for a network to assign high-conﬁdent one-hot labels for all perturbed
samples within the perturbation budget ϵ (Stutz et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2020). Intuitively, some
examples may naturally lie close to the decision boundary and should be assigned lower predictive
conﬁdence for the worst-case adversarial examples. It indicates that one-hot labels of some training
data may be noisy in AT1. After a certain training epoch, the model memorizes these “hard” training
examples with possibly noisy labels, leading to the reduction of test robustness, as shown in Fig. 7(a).
Thus, we hypothesize the cause of robust overﬁtting lies in the memorization of one-hot labels."
EXPLAINING ROBUST OVERFITTING,0.22485207100591717,"Our hypothesis is well supported by two pieces of evidence. First, we ﬁnd that when the perturbation
budget ϵ is small, robust overﬁtting does not occur, as shown in Fig. 7(b). This observation implies
that the one-hot labels are more appropriate as the targets for adversarial examples within a smaller
neighborhood while become noisier under a larger perturbation budget and lead to overﬁtting. Sec-
ond, we validate that the “hard” training examples with higher adversarial loss values are consistent
across different models. We ﬁrst train two independent networks (using the same architecture and
different random seeds) by PGD-AT and calculate the adversarial loss for each training sample. We
show the adversarial losses on 500 samples sorted by the loss of the ﬁrst model in Fig. 7(c). It can
be seen that the samples with lower adversarial losses of the ﬁrst model also have relatively lower
losses of the second one and vice versa. We further quantitatively measure the consistency of the ad-
versarial losses of all training samples between the two models using the Kendall’s rank coefﬁcient
(Kendall, 1938), which is 0.85 in this case. A similar result can be observed for two different model
architectures (see Appendix C.1). The results verify that the “hard” training examples with possibly
noisy labels are intrinsic of a dataset, supporting our hypothesis on why robust overﬁtting occurs."

MITIGATING ROBUST OVERFITTING,0.23076923076923078,"Based on the above analysis, we resort to the methods that are less prone to overﬁt noisy labels for
mitigating robust overﬁtting in AT. Although learning with noisy labels has been broadly studied in
ST (Natarajan et al., 2013; Patrini et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2018; Han et al., 2018; Zhang & Sabuncu,
2018), we ﬁnd that most of these approaches are not suitable for AT. For example, a typical line of
methods ﬁlter out noisy samples and train the models on the identiﬁed clean samples (Jiang et al.,
2018; Han et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2018). However, they will neglect a portion of training data with
noisy labels, which can lead to inferior results for AT due to the reduction of training data (Schmidt
et al., 2018). Table 2 shows the results to validate this."
MITIGATING ROBUST OVERFITTING,0.23372781065088757,"To address this problem, we propose to regularize the predictions of adversarial examples from being
over-conﬁdent by integrating the temporal ensembling (TE) approach (Laine & Aila, 2017) into
the AT frameworks. TE maintains an ensemble prediction of each data and penalizes the difference
between the current prediction and the ensemble prediction, which is effective for semi-supervised
learning and learning with noisy labels (Laine & Aila, 2017). We think that TE is suitable for AT
since it enables to leverage all training samples and hinders the network from excessive memoriza-

the smoothness in training labels and model weights (Chen et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2020), which
can alleviate robust overﬁtting to some extent. The signiﬁcant difference between our work and
them is that we provide a reasonable explanation for robust overﬁtting—one-hot labels are noisy
for AT, while previous methods did not give such an explanation and could be viewed as solutions
to our identiﬁed problem. To empirically compare with these methods, we conduct experiments
on CIFAR-10 with the ResNet-18 network. Under the PGD-AT framework, we compare with the
baseline PGD-AT, PGD-AT+LS, self-adaptive training (SAT) (Huang et al., 2020), and knowledge
distillation with stochastic weight averaging (KD-SWA) (Chen et al., 2021). We also adopt the Co-
teaching approach (Han et al., 2018) adapted to PGD-AT, which jointly trains two models using the
ﬁltered samples given by each other. The results under the adopted attacks are presented in Table 2.
Although various techniques can alleviate robust overﬁtting, our method achieves better robustness
than the others, validating its effectiveness. For Co-teaching, though robust overﬁtting is alleviated,
the performance is worse than our proposed method due to the reduction of training data."

both PGD-AT and TRADES cannot obtain near 100% robust training accuracy. We also ﬁnd under
this condition, even AT trained on true labels cannot get 100% robust training accuracy, indicating
that the gradient instability issue discussed in Sec. 3.2 results in the convergence problem."

LEARNING CURVES UNDER DIFFERENT NOISE RATES"

Fig. A.6 and Fig. A.7, respectively. In this experiment, we adopt the weight decay and data augmen-

before ﬁtting the noisy training set. Thus the model learns easy and simple patterns ﬁrst before ﬁt-
ting the noise, similar to the ﬁnding in ST (Arpit et al., 2017). It can also be observed that under 80%
noise rate, PGD-AT fails to converge. Note that when the noise rate is 0%, the network is trained
on true labels, but the robust test accuracy also decreases after a certain epoch. This phenomenon is
called robust overﬁtting (Rice et al., 2020), which is studied in Sec. 4."

examples is larger than that of noisy examples at beginning, which makes the model learn to classify.

examples (the two curves overlap together). And the unstable gradients provided by noisy examples

MORE DISCUSSIONS ON THE GENERALIZATION OF AT"

generalization gap, the model without any regularization can still generalize non-trivially. The three
explicit regularizations do not signiﬁcantly affect the model’s ability to memorize adversarial exam-
ples with random labels. In consequence, the explicit regularizers are not the adequate explanation
of generalization. By inspecting the learning dynamics of AT under different noise rates in Fig. A.6

ing set, meaning that the model learns simple patterns (i.e., clean data) before memorizing the hard
examples with wrong labels, similar to the observation in standard training (Arpit et al., 2017). The
results suggest that optimization by itself serves as an implicit regularizer to ﬁnd a model with good
generalization performance."
