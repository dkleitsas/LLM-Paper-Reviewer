ABSTRACT,0.004761904761904762,"Sparsely activated models (SAMs), such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), can eas-
ily scale to have outrageously large amounts of parameters without signiﬁcant
increase in computational cost. However, SAMs are reported to be parameter in-
efﬁcient such that larger models do not always lead to better performance. While
most on-going research focuses on improving SAMs models by exploring meth-
ods of routing inputs to experts, our analysis reveals that such research might not
lead to the solution we expect, i.e., the commonly-used routing methods based
on gating mechanisms do not work better than randomly routing inputs to ex-
perts. In this paper, we propose a new expert-based model, THOR (Transformer
witH StOchastic ExpeRts).
Unlike classic expert-based models, such as the
Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2021), experts in THOR are randomly acti-
vated for each input during training and inference. THOR models are trained
using a consistency regularized loss, where experts learn not only from train-
ing data but also from other experts as teachers, such that all the experts make
consistent predictions. We validate the effectiveness of THOR on machine trans-
lation tasks. Results show that THOR models are more parameter efﬁcient in
that they signiﬁcantly outperform the Transformer and MoE models across var-
ious settings. For example, in multilingual translation, THOR outperforms the
Switch Transformer by 2 BLEU scores, and obtains the same BLEU score as
that of a state-of-the-art MoE model (Kim et al., 2021) that is 18 times larger.

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.014285714285714285,"Large neural network models have shown to be effective in many natural language processing tasks
such as machine translation (Lewis et al., 2020; Conneau & Lample, 2019), natural language un-
derstanding (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; He et al., 2020), and natural language generation
(Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). These models are usually densely activated. That is, a
model uses all its parameters to process all inputs. One drawback of these models is the prohibitive
training cost. Moreover, the extreme size drastically reduces inference speed, further limiting the
models’ practicality."
INTRODUCTION,0.01904761904761905,"To address these issues, sparsely activated models (SAMs, Shazeer et al. 2017) have been proposed.
A SAM adaptively selects a subset of its parameters for different inputs during model training and
inference. This makes it possible to train SAMs that are an order of magnitude larger than densely
activated models without signiﬁcant increase in computational cost. For example, the sparsely acti-
vated GShard (Lepikhin et al., 2020) consists of over 600 billion parameters and the Switch Trans-
former (Fedus et al., 2021) 1.5 trillion parameters, while GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), which is
arguably the largest densely activated model, consists of only 175 billion parameters."

ple feed-forward neural networks (FFNs) in parallel. Each FFN is referred to as an expert. During"

INTRODUCTION,0.0380952380952381,"training, an input is routed to a ﬁxed number of experts, such that the number of ﬂoating point op-
erations (FLOPs) of one forward pass remains constant, regardless of the total number of experts.
Thus, training SAMs is much more cost-efﬁcient than training densely activated models. For exam-
ple, training of Switch-large (Fedus et al., 2021) and that of T5-large (Raffel et al., 2019) require the
same forward FLOPs, despite that the former is 35 times larger (26.3 vs. 0.74 billion parameters)."
INTRODUCTION,0.04285714285714286,"However, SAMs have been reported to be parameter inefﬁcient. For example, although the Switch-
large model is 35 times larger than T5-large, its performance on the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al.,
2019a) is only slightly better (88.5 vs. 87.8). There are also cases where the performance of SAMs
is even worse than smaller densely activated models. For example, the performance of Switch-
large is worse than T5-large on the ARC Reasoning Challenge (66.0 vs. 68.8) (Clark et al., 2018).
In another example, although GShard (Lepikhin et al., 2020) shows substantial gains over densely
activated models, a diminishing return with larger number of parameters has been observed."
INTRODUCTION,0.047619047619047616,"Most on-going research has focused on improving SAMs by developing effective routing methods.
Since only a subset of model parameters (i.e., experts) are updated for each input during training,
we need to decide which experts to be activated given an input. Existing works (Shazeer et al.,
2017; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) use a gating network for input
routing. However, the gating mechanism suffers from the notorious load imbalance issue: the gate’s
weight could collapse such that nearly all the inputs are routed to the same expert. Therefore, many
methods are proposed to mitigate this issue, such as noisy gating (Shazeer et al., 2017), expert
capacity (Lepikhin et al., 2020), load balancing loss (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021), and
k Top-1 gating (Yang et al., 2021). However, these routing methods have not been proved effective
to make SAMs more parameter efﬁcient. To understand why SAMs are not parameter efﬁcient, we
analyze the performance of several classic MoE models. Our analysis reveals that a SAM does not
always outperform a densely activated model of a similar size, conﬁrming the results reported in
Yang et al. (2021). Moreover, we also observe that the widely-used routing method based on the
gating mechanism does not work better than randomly routing inputs to experts,"
INTRODUCTION,0.05238095238095238,"Inspired by our ﬁndings, we propose a new SAM, THOR (Transformer witH StOchastic ExpeRts).
Unlike classic SAMs, such as the Switch Transformer, experts in THOR are randomly activated
(with no need of any gating mechanism) for each input during training and inference. THOR models
are trained by minimizing both the cross-entropy loss and a consistency regularization term, such
that experts can learn not only from training data but also from other experts as teachers so that all
the experts make consistent predictions."
INTRODUCTION,0.05714285714285714,"To validate the effectiveness of THOR, we have conducted extensive experiments on machine
translation using three settings: low-resource, rich-resource, and multilingual. Results show that
THOR models outperform state-of-the-art MoE models by an average of 2 BLEU score on twelve
low-resource translation tasks. In the rich-resource setting, THOR achieves new state-of-the-art
results on the two widely-used translation benchmarks, WMT’16 En-De and WMT’14 En-Fr. On
multilingual translation tasks, the THOR model with 300 million parameters achieves 2 BLEU score
improvement over a state-of-the-art MoE model of the same size. Moreover, our model achieves
state-of-the-art results on these tasks — the same BLEU score that is achieved by the Z-code MoE
model (Kim et al., 2021) with 5.5 billion parameters (18 times larger)."

mance in many sequence-to-sequence natural language processing tasks, such as neural machine
translation. The model contains an encoder and a decoder. The encoder consists of multiple encoder
layers, each having an identical structure. An encoder layer employs a self-attention mechanism and
a feed-forward neural network (FFN). The decoder is similarly constructed, except for an additional
cross-attention mechanism in each decoder layer."

Transformer layer. Each of these expert layers contain an attention mechanism and multiple FFNs
in parallel, where each FFN is referred to as an expert. Let {Ei}N

denotes the total number of experts. A gating mechanism decides to which expert(s) an input should

BACKGROUND,0.09047619047619047,"Notice that in Eq. 2, input x only activates K instead of N experts, where K ≪N, e.g., K = 2 and
N = 2048 in GShard (Lepikhin et al., 2020). This implies that the number of FLOPs required for
one forward pass does not increase with the number of experts N. Therefore, SAMs can scale to an
enormous size without any signiﬁcant increase in training time and inference time."
BACKGROUND,0.09523809523809523,"The gate weight matrix Wg (Eq. 1) is trained together with the rest of the model parameters. Because
there is no constraint on the learned weights, it is possible that Wg collapses such that one row
dominates, i.e., all the inputs are routed to one expert. This problem is referred to as load imbalance.
Existing works adopt various ad-hoc heuristics to mitigate this issue, e.g., adding Gaussian noise
to Eq. 1 (noisy gating, Shazeer et al. 2017), limiting the maximum number of inputs that can be
routed to an expert (expert capacity, Lepikhin et al. 2020), imposing a load balancing loss (Lepikhin
et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021), and using linear assignment (Lewis et al., 2021). There are other
works that remove the gating mechanism such that load imbalance is no longer an issue, e.g., by
incorporating hash functions (Roller et al., 2021). Besides the load imbalance issue, there are also
heated discussions on how to construct T in Eq. 2. For example, Shazeer et al. (2017); Lepikhin
et al. (2020); Yang et al. (2021) conjecture that routing inputs to K > 1 experts is necessary, while
Fedus et al. (2021) argue that using K = 1 is sufﬁcient and more computationally efﬁcient."

(Vaswani et al., 2017) model of the same model size."

the Transformer by a signiﬁcant margin."
ANALYSIS OF SPARSELY ACTIVATED MODELS,0.11904761904761904,"To interpret the results of Figure 1, we examine the load of each expert and the conﬁdence scores
of routing inputs to different experts. An expert’s load is deﬁned as the proportion of inputs that are
assigned to it. For an input that is routed to an expert, its routing conﬁdence score (output of the
gating mechanism) determines the level of preference, e.g., if the routing conﬁdence score is 0.5,
then the gate has no preference for either expert. For each expert, we compute the average routing
conﬁdence score over all the inputs assigned to it."
ANALYSIS OF SPARSELY ACTIVATED MODELS,0.12380952380952381,"Figure 2 shows that after the early stage of training (i.e., the ﬁrst 200 iterations), the gate weight
collapses and nearly all the inputs are routed to expert 2. Also, the average routing conﬁdence score
of expert 2 is close to 1.0, which means that the gate strongly prefers expert 2 to expert 1. In this
case, only one of the experts is sufﬁciently trained. Figure 3 depicts a different scenario, where the
inputs are randomly dispatched to the experts. Notice that after approximately 4000 iterations, the
two experts are equally loaded, and the probabilities of assigning any input to expert 1 and expert 2
are almost identical, indicating that the gating mechanism has no preference for either expert."
ANALYSIS OF SPARSELY ACTIVATED MODELS,0.12857142857142856,"We have identiﬁed two behaviors of the gating mechanism: load imbalance and random routing.
The former is also reported in recent papers (Shazeer et al., 2017; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al.,
2021). We further investigate the Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2021), which is a state-of-the-
art MoE variant that incorporates various methods to resolve the load imbalance issue. In addition,
because behavior of the gating mechanism in the Switch Transformer mimics random routing (see
Appendix A), we examine the effect of discarding the gate and randomly assigning inputs to experts.
Figure 4 demonstrates the validation losses and BLEU scores of the Transformer and three variants
of the Switch Transformer, where inputs are routed according to tokens (referred to as Switch(t)),

THOR: TRANSFORMER WITH STOCHASTIC EXPERTS"
ANALYSIS OF SPARSELY ACTIVATED MODELS,0.18095238095238095,"The ineffectiveness of the gating mechanism, as shown in our experiments, motivates us to propose
a new expert-based model, THOR (Transformer witH StOchastic ExpeRts). In THOR, a pair of
experts are randomly selected and activated in each layer during a training iteration, and then all the
inputs in a batch are processed using the same pair of experts. Our method drastically simpliﬁes
model design, and has two additional advantages. First, it eliminates the load imbalance issue be-
cause randomly selecting a pair of experts in each iteration allows each expert to have a fair chance
to be sufﬁciently trained. The ad-hoc heuristics, such as the load balancing loss, as discussed in
Section 2, are no longer needed. Second, unlike the gating mechanism, THOR does not introduce
any additional model parameters."
ANALYSIS OF SPARSELY ACTIVATED MODELS,0.18571428571428572,"One problem of THOR is that without a gating mechanism, experts need to be randomly selected
during inference, and we may obtain inconsistent inference results due to different random seeds.
For example, on a Czech-to-English translation dataset, our experiments show that randomness can
result in a 0.5 BLEU score difference."

of the regularizer. In mini-batch SGD training, we randomly sample a pair of experts to activate
at each layer for each batch. During inference, we can also randomly select an expert to activate
at each layer for each input, similar to that in training. We can also use different expert-selection
methods, such as expert-ensemble, as to be discussed in Section 5 (Table 5)."
ANALYSIS OF SPARSELY ACTIVATED MODELS,0.22857142857142856,"The THOR training objective of Eq. 3 forces all the experts to minimize training errors while mak-
ing the same predictions as much as possible. Thus, in each training step, each expert optimizes its
parameters by learning from both the training data (via minimizing the cross-entropy loss) and its
paired expert as a teacher (via minimizing the KL divergence). Although these experts are learned
to make consistent predictions, they converge to different (local) optima given the randomness in-
troduced in training, e.g., initialization, mini-batch SGD, random routing, etc. Thus, every expert
learns from a set of diverse teachers during the course of training, which helps to improve model’s
performance. In addition, by penalizing experts that yield inconsistent predictions from the others,
the consistency regularizer also helps reducing the variance of model prediction."
ANALYSIS OF SPARSELY ACTIVATED MODELS,0.23333333333333334,"THOR is conceptually similar to dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) since both methods route an input
to some randomly selected sub-net components (i.e., experts in THOR and neurons in dropout).
However, THOR differs from dropout in several important aspects, making it a better choice for
efﬁcient training and serving of large-scale neural models. First, THOR can be applied to both
training and inference, while dropout is only used for training. Second, THOR is shown to be more
robust in large-scale model training than dropout. For example, our models are less likely to overﬁt
with the increase in the number of experts (see Figure 9). Third, THOR leads to a sparse model"

creases the number of heads from 8 to 4 with the dimension of each head doubled. We use two
experts for the expert-based models. We remark that even though THOR increases the number of
parameters, its inference speed (in terms of FLOPs) is the same as Transformer-base because only
one expert is activated for each input. Interested readers refer to Appendix C for more details."

We examine the relative contributions of the three loss terms used in the
THOR training objective of Eq. 3: CE1, CE2 and CR. The result in Table 4 shows that the con-
sistency regularizer CR is crucial to the model performance, and that dropping one of the two CE
terms leads to only very small BLEU score loss since the two cross-entropy terms play the same role
in training."
ABLATION EXPERIMENTS,0.47619047619047616,"Inference Methods.
We compare three inference methods: (1) Dispatch(s) uses sentence-
level random routing, where all tokens in one sentence are routed to the same expert; (2)
Dispatch(t) uses token-level random routing, where tokens within a sentence are routed to
different experts; (3) Ensemble, where each sentence is routed to all the N experts, and the N
hidden representations in each layer are averaged. Note that the number of FLOPs is larger for
Ensemble because we need to run forward pass for each input through N experts. Table 5 shows
that Dispatch(s) and Dispatch(t) perform similarly, and Ensemble yields the best BLEU
score with a cost of longer inference time."

To investigate the effect of the regularization strength α, we run ex-

performance is not very sensitive to α as long as the value is large enough, say α > 2.0."
ABLATION EXPERIMENTS,0.5333333333333333,"Consistency of Model Prediction.
We study the variance of model prediction due to the use
of randomly activated experts during inference. We compare THOR and the Switch Transformer,
where we remove the trained gate during inference. For each model, we compute the variance of
model prediction based on 20 runs. As shown in Figure 8, THOR makes more consistent predic-
tions than Switch Transformer due to the use of the consistency regularizer for model training. The
variance of THOR is below 0.002, whereas the variance of Switch Transformer is 0.008, four times
larger. We remark that by removing the trained router from the Switch Transformer, model perfor-
mance only marginally decreases (from 20.6 to 20.4). This further indicates that a trained router
may not be better than a random router."
ABLATION EXPERIMENTS,0.5380952380952381,"Overﬁtting.
We compare the THOR model and the Transformer model regarding how likely they
overﬁt the training data when the model size increases. We run experiments on the De-En data in
the low-resource setting, where the dropout rate of the FFNs in the Transformer is selected such that
the number of parameters trained in one iteration is the same as the THOR model. As shown in
Figure 9, THOR does not show any sign of overﬁtting — we observe a consistent improvement in
BLEU score as we increase the number of experts from 2 to 8. In contrast, the Transformer model’s
performance deteriorates as we increase the hidden dimension of its FFN from 2k to 8k. We remark
that we also observe the overﬁtting phenomenon on larger datasets, e.g., the Transformer overﬁts on
the Cs-En dataset when we set the hidden dimension of its FFN to 16k."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5476190476190477,"We present a new expert-based sparsely activated model, THOR. Unlike existing SAMs, such as
the Switch Transformer, experts in THOR are randomly activated for each input during training
and inference. THOR models are trained using a consistency regularized loss, where every expert
learns not only from training data but also from other experts as teachers so that all the experts make
consistent predictions. As a result, not only can large-scale THOR models be trained and served as
efﬁciently as classic MoE models, THOR models also demonstrate a better generalization capability
in that they are more parameter-efﬁcient, less likely to overﬁt, make more consistent predictions,
and achieve better results consistently across different settings. We validate the effectiveness of
THOR via a comprehensive empirical study on machine translation. In all the three settings (i.e.,
low-resource, rich-resource, and multilingual translation), THOR models signiﬁcantly outperform
the vanilla Transformer, and Switch Transformer, a state-of-the-art MoE model."

TRAINING DETAILS"
REFERENCES,0.7714285714285715,"We consider two Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models proposed in Shen et al. (2019), which are de-
noted “MoE(dec)” and “MoE(tok)”. In the ﬁrst variant, each expert is a separate Transformer de-
coder. In the second variant, each expert is a different token, i.e., if we route the input to expert one,
then we replace the ⟨bos⟩(begin-of-sentence) token in the input sentence with a ⟨expert1⟩token.
Note that embeddings of these expert tokens are trained together with the rest of the model parame-
ters. These models are equipped with an expectation-maximization optimization framework. Such a
framework facilitates computing the probability of assigning an input to a speciﬁc expert according
to the gating mechanism. Please refer to Shen et al. (2019) for details about these models."

REFERENCES,0.8142857142857143,"Figure 10 shows the results for Switch(s) without the load balancing loss, where we route inputs to
experts on the sentence-level. We see that after about 10k training iterations, the average routing
conﬁdence score of expert 1 and expert 2 becomes similar, and both of these scores are around 0.60.
Moreover, the load of the experts are not balanced, i.e., there is a 10% difference in the loads (55%
vs. 45%). We conclude that behavior of the gating mechanism of Switch(s) is similar to Figure 3,
i.e., the gate is essentially randomly routing inputs to experts without any preference."

experts on the token-level, i.e., different tokens within the same sentence may be routed to different
experts. Similar to the Switch(s) case, the average routing conﬁdence score of both of the two
experts converges to around 0.55. This indicates that the gate do not prefer any expert given an
input. Moreover, the load of the experts are not balanced, the same as in Figure 10. Based on
these observations, we conclude that behavior of the gating mechanism of Switch(t) is also random
routing."

load for both Switch(s) and Switch(t), e.g., there is a less than 0.4% imbalance for Switch(s) and less
than 0.2% imbalance for Switch(t). In comparison, the imbalance is around 10% for the two Switch
Transformer variants without the load balancing loss. Also, similar to the case without the load bal-
ancing loss, the average routing conﬁdence score converges to around 0.60 for Switch(s) and around
0.55 for Switch(t). Based on the observations, we conclude that behavior of the gating mechanism

REFERENCES,0.9666666666666667,"Figure 14 demonstrates the results. In Figure 14 (left), notice that the Switch Transformer trains
faster than the vanilla Transformer, and this scaling property is more signiﬁcant when we increase
the number of experts."
REFERENCES,0.9714285714285714,"From Figure 14 (right), we see that with 2 experts, the Switch Transformer behaves slightly worse
the vanilla Transformer in terms of validation BLEU. However, when we increase the number of
experts, performance of the Switch Transformer continues to improve and outperforms the vanilla
Transformer with the same number of FLOPs. This indicates that in order for a sparsely activated
model to outperform a densely activated one, we need to scale the former to contain much more
parameters than the latter. Our observations are consistent with existing literature (Lepikhin et al.,
2020; Fedus et al., 2021). For example, in Fedus et al. 2021, the sparsely activated Switch-base
outperforms the densely activated T5-base using the same number of FLOPs. However, the former
is more than 30 times larger (7.5 billion vs. 0.22 billion parameters)."
REFERENCES,0.9761904761904762,"Our method is more parameter efﬁcient than the conventional methods. From Figure 14 (right), we

with only 2 experts. Moreover, when we increase the number of experts, performance of THOR also
improves."
REFERENCES,0.9809523809523809,"We also compare inference speed of Transformer, Switch Transformer, and THOR in Table 8. Note
that for THOR , we use the Dispatch(s) method in Table 5. Note that the inference speed of
Switch Transformer and THOR is slower than the vanilla Transformer because of the computation
and communication overhead induced by input routing. Such an overhead is more noticeable when
the number of experts is large. We remark that in Fedus et al. 2021, the speed of Switch-base is
about half of T5-base (780 vs. 1600 samples per second)."
