ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.006993006993006993,"The classification problem is a core problem of supervised learning, which is
widely present in our life. As a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, Ker-
nel methods have been widely and effectively applied to classification problems.
However, when very complex patterns are encountered, the existing kernel meth-
ods are powerless. Recent studies have shown that quantum kernel methods can
effectively handle some classification problems of complex patterns that classi-
cal kernel methods cannot handle. However, this does not mean that quantum
kernel methods are better than classical kernel methods in all cases. It is still un-
clear under what circumstances quantum kernel methods can realize their great
potential. In this paper, by exploring and summarizing the essential differences
between quantum kernel functions and classical kernel functions, we propose a
criterion based on inter-class and intra-class distance and geometric properties to
determine under what circumstances quantum kernel methods will be superior.
We validate our method with toy examples and multiple real datasets from Qiskit
and Kaggle. The experiments show that our method can be used as a valid deter-
mination method."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.02097902097902098,"Since the birth of quantum computing, researchers have been looking for the best place to apply
quantum algorithms. The first two quantum algorithms devised were Grover (1996) and Shor (1994).
They proved the advantages of quantum algorithms in some specific problems such as search and
factorization theoretically. With the rise of artificial intelligence, more and more quantum algorithms
combine quantum computing with machine learning. For example, quantum neural network (QNN)
was first proposed by Ezhov & Ventura (2000) but was only defined in general terms at the physical
level. Ricks & Ventura (2003) defined an approach to train QNNs, but the complexity of its method
is exponential. Subsequently, Lloyd et al. (2013), Blacoe et al. (2013), and Rebentrost et al. (2014)
tried to introduce quantum computing into clustering, distributed semantics, and SVMs, respectively,
but their approaches were too limited to theory. As researchers introduce quantum into various
machine learning algorithms, Schuld et al. (2015), Biamonte et al. (2017), Kopczyk (2018), Ciliberto
et al. (2018) have started to summarize and sort out the concept of quantum machine learning."
INTRODUCTION,0.027972027972027972,"The physical implementation of quantum computers has made great strides in recent years. In
2019, Arute et al. (2019) announced the achievement of quantum hegemony, a milestone event
in quantum computing. Also, thanks to the emergence of several quantum computing platforms,
such as those of IBM and Google, it has become possible for ordinary researchers to translate their
research on quantum machine learning algorithms from theory to practice. For example, Farhi
& Neven (2018), Quek et al. (2021), Verdon et al. (2019), Garg et al. (2019), Srivastava et al.
(2020), and Meichanetzidis et al. (2020) have demonstrated the value of quantum machine learning
in machine learning tasks by practice, respectively."
INTRODUCTION,0.03496503496503497,"On the other hand, one of the most famous machine learning algorithms is the kernel method. A
detailed description of the kernel method has been given by Burges (1998a), Muller et al. (2001),
Scholkopf (2001) and Hofmann et al. (2008). Inspired by the classical kernel approach, Rebentrost
et al. (2014) proposed a quantum kernel approach based on SVM, but only theoretically feasible."

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK"
BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK,0.09090909090909091,"Classical Kernel. Kernel methods, summarised by Muller et al. (2001) and Hofmann et al. (2008),
are an important class of machine learning methods that carry out machine learning by defining
which data points are similar to each other and which are not. Mathematically, the similarity is a
distance in the data space, i.e., the distance between digital representations of data points. Specifi-
cally, the kernel method uses a feature mapping function fc to map data from a point in the original
input space O to a higher-dimensional Hilbert feature space Fc, i.e., fc : O →Fc, making sepa-
rability between data classes more explicit. One of the most famous methods is the support vector
machine (SVM) proposed by Burges (1998b)."
BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK,0.0979020979020979,"One important factor that makes the kernel method successful is the kernel track. Scholkopf (2001)
pointed out that instead of explicitly calculating the distance in high-dimensional Hilbert space,
this distance can be calculated implicitly in low-dimensional input space by the kernel function
K, but with the same effect. It can reduce the computational effort significantly and avoid a large
number of calculations. A nonlinear classification problem is one of the classical machine learning
problems, and kernel methods can effectively handle such problems. Recall that in classical kernel
methods, such as support vector machine, a data point xi ∈Rn is mapped into a potentially much
higher dimensional feature space Fc via a nonlinear mapping function fc, where xi is represented
by ϕ(xi), i.e., fc : xi →ϕ(xi). In space Fc, the nonlinear classification problem becomes a linear
classification problem and simplifies the problem. The inner product of ϕ(xi)T ϕ(xj) is often seen
as distances between xi and xj in the new space Fc."
BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK,0.1048951048951049,"Quantum Kernel. The quantum kernel method is a kernel method designed to run on quantum
computers based on quantum computing properties. Its principle is almost identical to the classical
kernel method except that it maps the data point from the original input space O to the quantum
Hilbert space Fq, i.e., fq : O →Fq. The key to the quantum kernel methods is the quantum
mapping function fq. We can view the feature mapping function fq as the key to define the quantum
kernel methods. Thus, if the quantum kernel approach is superior, the superiority lies in the quantum
mapping function. The mechanism of quantum kernel methods is basically the same as that of
classical kernel methods. The data point xi is mapped from the original input space O to the quantum
state space Fq, i.e., fq : xi →|ϕ(xi)⟩, where the |·⟩denotes a vector and physically it represents a
state of some quantum system. The ⟨·| is the Hermitian Conjugate of the vector |·⟩. In practice, the
feature map is realized by acting the circuit U(xi) on the initial quantum state |0n⟩, i.e.,"

Z0, Z1 are quantum Z-Gates, and H is the quantum Hadamard-Gate. We denote the corresponding
quantum kernel method as the Z-ZZ quantum kernel method, and the corresponding feature map is
showed in Fig.1B(3). The feature maps of the Z quantum kernel method and the ZZ quantum kernel
method are shown in Fig.1B(1) and Fig.1B(2), respectively. In this paper, all references to quantum

we compare these three quantum kernel methods."

separates different classes and makes the margin as large as possible. In general cases, i.e., nonlinear
cases, the data is mapped non-linearly to high dimensional Hilbert space by a mapping function.
Then the distance between two data points can be calculated using the kernel function. Suppose

effectively used or not. There is no answer to this question. Mercer (1909) argues that a valid kernel
function needs to satisfy symmetry and positive definiteness. However, some kernel functions that
do not obey Mercer’s condition still achieve good results in some specific tasks, such as the widely
used sigmoid kernel function proposed by Lin & Lin (2003). Mix kernel function proposed by Smits

QUANTUM KERNEL IS A PROBABILISTIC KERNEL,0.2517482517482518,"The mechanism of the quantum kernel function is similar to some traditional kernel functions. It
follows the Mercer theorem and is a practical kernel function that expands the family of kernel
functions. However, its implementation is based on quantum superposition states and entanglement.
Since the values obtained are based on probabilities in a statistical sense, we call it a probabilistic
kernel function. For correspondence, we call the classical kernel function a deterministic kernel
function. We try to clearly show the relationship and difference between different kernel functions
by a diagram (Fig.2). It is worth noting that there are no guarantees for one kernel to work better
than the other in all cases, according to the No Free Lunch Theorem (Wolpert & Macready (1997)).
Choosing different kernel functions in various subjects will achieve better results. The primary
purpose of this paper is to investigate under what circumstances the quantum kernel method is better

Mersenne Twister is a pseudo random number generator which was first proposed by Matsumoto

Mersenne Twister algorithm generates discrete uniformly distributed random numbers in the range
[0, 2k −1]. Solving this problem is a discrete logarithm problem (DLP). For DLP, Liu et al. (2021)

domness of the random distribution, we take the average result of 50 times as the result of each
experiment. The experiments demonstrate that the quantum kernel method has a more robust learn-
ing capability than the classical kernel method in this complex pattern."

the geometric non-random dataset, respectively. B. The horizontal coordinates indicate the dataset

EXPERIMENTS RESULTS,0.5944055944055944,"The quantum kernel method fails at large values of δ. In this part, we will show that our cri-
teria can effectively determine whether quantum kernel methods can demonstrate advantages over
classical kernel methods or not. First, taking the Digits dataset as an example, we perform binary
classification for every two digits. Thus, we generate 45 small datasets. We then use PCA to re-
duce the dimensionality of all data to 2 dimensions, as shown in Fig.5. We recorded each small
dataset’s training and test accuracy after applying four classical kernel methods and a quantum
kernel method. The bottom left panel in Fig.5 shows the prediction accuracy of each method. Ac-
cording to the experimental results, we attach a corner mark to each data set. The red rounded corner
markers indicate that the quantum kernel method has the potential for quantum dominance on the
corresponding dataset, while the black rounded corner markers indicate that it does not. The blue
corner markers indicate that the quantum kernel method is indistinguishable from the classical ker-
nel method. Intuitively, the quantum kernel approach for linearly divisible data sets does not show
superiority. However, for complex models with relatively high fusion, the quantum kernel approach
has the potential to be superior."
EXPERIMENTS RESULTS,0.6013986013986014,"To validate our criteria δ, we prepared 81 datasets: 45 small datasets from Digits, 14 datasets from

in Fig.6. The magnitude of δ on each dataset is shown with an asterisk in Fig.6. According to the
experiments, when the quantum kernel method has an advantage, the asterisks appear below the 0.6
level line all the time. We can get the conclusion that (i) the availability of quantum superiority
correlates with δ and (ii) the quantum kernel method can be better than the classical kernel method
when δ < 0.6, although it is not a sufficient condition."
EXPERIMENTS RESULTS,0.6293706293706294,"Simple quantum kernel methods do not offer quantum advantages. When the feature space is so
large that the kernel function is computationally expensive, quantum kernel methods can effectively
estimate their kernel functions, but classical kernel methods cannot. So, quantum kernel methods are
preferred over classical kernel methods for classification problems with complex patterns. However,
a simpler quantum kernel function can be simulated classically. For a simple-kernel-based quantum
kernel method, it no more has the superiority. Its ability to handle complex pattern problems is
significantly reduced and even inferior to classical kernel methods. Interestingly, sometimes this
simple quantum kernel function works well with simple pattern problems."

cal kernel method and the three quantum kernel methods on 68 training datasets, we find that some
kernel methods based on simple quantum kernel functions, such as the Z quantum kernel method,
do outperform the Z-ZZ kernel method on some datasets, but do not outperform the best classical
kernel methods. However, when quantum superiority exists, it is often achieved by Z-ZZ kernel
methods. The experiments show that the quantum kernel method superiority on only one dataset is
achieved by the Z quantum kernel method."

method is optimal, which has only one case, and orange asterisks to indicate the value of δ when the
ZZ-quantum kernel-based method is the best, although this case does not occur in the experiment.

kernel method and the classical kernel method are best, respectively."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.6783216783216783,"The classification problem is one of the most common problems in machine learning, and both clas-
sical kernel methods and quantum kernel methods can effectively handle the classification problem.
However, it is difficult to determine what situation each of them is suitable for. This paper explores
when quantum kernel methods can take quantum advantage by comparing different kernel functions.
Moreover, a judgment criterion is proposed to help one decide when quantum kernel methods can
achieve better results than classical kernel methods. Experiments show that our method is effective."
