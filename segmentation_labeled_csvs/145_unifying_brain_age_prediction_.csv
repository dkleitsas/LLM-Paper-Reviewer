ABSTRACT,0.013333333333333334,"Age-related morphological brain changes are known to be diﬀerent in healthy and disease-
aﬀected aging. Biological brain age estimation from MRI scans is a common way to quantify
this eﬀect whereas diﬀerences between biological and chronological age indicate degenera-
tive processes. The ability to visualize and analyze the morphological age-related changes
in the image space directly is essential to improve the understanding of brain aging. In
this work, we propose a novel deep learning based approach to unify biological brain age
estimation and age-conditioned template creation in a single, consistent model. We achieve
this by developing a deterministic autoencoder that successfully disentangles age-related
morphological changes and subject-speciﬁc variations. This allows its use as a brain age
regressor as well as a generative brain aging model. The proposed approach demonstrates
accurate biological brain age prediction, and realistic generation of age-conditioned brain
templates and simulated age-speciﬁc brain images when applied to a database of more than
2000 subjects.

INTRODUCTION,0.02666666666666667,1. Introduction
INTRODUCTION,0.04,"Healthy brain aging in adults is known to be associated with atrophy, whereas diﬀerent
cerebral regions are aﬀected non-uniformly by aging (Peters, 2006).
Many neurological
diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (Fotenos et al., 2005) or epilepsy (Whelan et al., 2018),
are known to cause increased or accelerated regional or global atrophy. Thus, understanding
healthy brain aging is important to improve the early diagnosis of neurological diseases.
For these reasons, multiple studies used the biological brain age as a biomarker for neu-
rological diseases by comparing it to the true chronological age of the subject (Gaser et al.,
2013). Biological brain age is usually estimated using structural magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) scans (Cole et al., 2017) or extracted features (Valizadeh et al., 2017) utilizing
classical, unidirectional regression models that map an input to an age scalar. However,
such models usually lack of interpretability as they are unidirectional. Post-hoc explainabil-
ity methods, such as gradient-based methods, can be used along with convolutional neural"

INTRODUCTION,0.06666666666666667,"networks (CNN) to identify the most important regions within the input image (Levakov
et al., 2020). However, these methods often lead to noisy outputs and lack of robustness
(Arun et al., 2020), introducing the need for interpretable models. On the other hand, re-
cent studies introduced counterfactuals, consisting in generating hypothetical alternates of
the reality. Pawlowski et al. (2020), for instance, used a structural causal model to generate
brain MRI scan counterfactuals based on age, sex and brain ventricle volume. Their model
allows to modify these variables and generate simulated brain MRI scan for speciﬁc sub-
jects at a diﬀerent age, for example, but is not a predictive model. Furthermore, Bass et al.
(2020) used image-to-image translation to translate brain MRI scans between two classes
corresponding to young and old subjects, while generating class-relevant feature attribution
maps.
More recently, bidirectional approaches have been proposed, which allow to estimate
biological brain age based on MRI scans and to generate simulated brain MRI scans for
speciﬁc ages with the same model (Zhao et al., 2019; Wilms et al., 2020). The assumed
beneﬁts of such uniﬁed models are an improved performance of both tasks, explainability
of the unidirectional results as they can be tracked back to the image space, and better
use of the training data (Wilms et al., 2020). These bidirectional models map the input
MRI scans to a structured latent space, in which one component contains the age-related
information while the others contain the remaining subject-speciﬁc information. However,
only a few studies have built such uniﬁed models so far and they used complex stochastic
generative models.
In Wilms et al. (2020) for example, an invertible neural network (INN) based framework
is used to predict age and reconstruct full MRI scans. The framework results in reasonable
age prediction accuracy value and realistic age-conditioned image synthesis. However, the
proposed approach requires multiple advanced preprocessing steps and uses deformation
ﬁelds instead of the MRI scans as inputs to the INN. Moreover, INNs are stochastic gen-
erative models with a complex training process that requires a large amount of data and
careful parameter tuning.
The main hypothesis of this work is that a deterministic autoencoder can be used to built
such a bidirectional, uniﬁed brain aging model, which avoids many of the problems related to
training and designing stochastic models, and can use minimally pre-processed MRI scans
as input. This idea is supported by recent work from the machine learning community
(Ghosh et al., 2020), where it was shown that traditional deterministic autoencoders can
successfully serve as generative models for many tasks while producing comparable results
to, for example, complex stochastic variational autoencoders.
Our model uses a deterministic autoencoder coupled with an invertible latent space dis-
entanglement module to transform the input MRI datasets into a low dimensional latent
space, in which the age component is disentangled from the age-unrelated anatomical vari-
ations. This disentanglement is achieved with a subspace projection method based on (Li
et al., 2020) that takes as its input the latent space of the autoencoder. We show that using
such an easily trainable architecture leads to accurate age predictions and allows to generate
realistic age-speciﬁc templates of the brain. Additionally, age-conditioned generative mod-
eling is achieved by imposing a Gaussian mixture model on the age-unrelated anatomical
components of the latent space and ﬁxing the age component."

IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.12,2.1. Problem formulation
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.13333333333333333,"In this work, the aim is to train a uniﬁed deep learning model able to perform brain age
prediction and to generate new samples conditioned on age (see Figure 1). The data used
in this study contains for each participant i ∈{1, ..., Np}:"
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.14666666666666667,"• a T1-weighted 3D brain MRI scan, cropped around the ventricular region, of size
h × w × d, denoted Xi ∈Rh×w×d."
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.16,• the participant’s chronological age ai ∈R.
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.17333333333333334,"The main component of our model is a deterministic autoencoder consisting of an encoder
e that maps an input image to a low dimensional latent space and a decoder d, which
approximates the inverse operation.
Both, e and d, are non-linear functions.
That is,
e(Xi) = zi ∈RNls, where Nls is the latent space size, and d(zi) = ˆ
Xi, where ˆ
Xi corresponds
to the model’s reconstruction of Xi. In this standard setup, the latent space representation
zi contains age-related and unrelated information about Xi. To isolate the age information,
we introduce an invertible linear function f(zi) = z′
i ∈RNls that maps zi to a structured rep-
resentation z′
i. Here, the ﬁrst component of z′
i represents the estimated biological brain age"

IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.2,"ˆai, solving the age regression problem, and the other components contain the age-unrelated
anatomical variability. With a slight abuse of notation and ignoring the components of z′
i
containing the variations unrelated to age, we can write ˆai = f ◦e(Xi) and ˆ
Xi = d◦f−1(ai).
We argue that f can be a simple linear function because e and d fully account for the non-
linear component needed to perform the mapping (Li et al., 2020). Finally and following
(Ghosh et al., 2020), a Gaussian mixture model is ﬁtted to the training data to estimate
the distribution of the components of z′
i that are unrelated to age. This allows us to sample
new age-conditioned structured representations z′
i from the model and to reconstruct the
associated MRI scan."

RESULTS/EXPERIMENTS,0.32,3.1. Clinical data
RESULTS/EXPERIMENTS,0.3333333333333333,"The data used in this study consists of T1-weighted brain MRI scans of 2118 predominantly
healthy adults (1029 males, 1089 females) aged between 21 and 82 years (mean: 51 ±
14), acquired on a single scanner using the same scanning parameters. The participants
were randomly selected in the region of Pomerania, Germany, as part of the Study of
Health In Pomerania (SHIP) (V¨olzke et al., 2011). Additionally, the IXI database (https:
//brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/) containing 563 T1-weighted scans of healthy
adults aged between 20 and 86 years (mean: 49 ± 16), collected on 3 diﬀerent sites, was
used as an independent test set."

aﬃne transformation and bias ﬁeld corrected using ANTs (Tustison et al., 2010; Avants

were cropped in the T1-weighted MRI datasets. This region was chosen because the aging
eﬀects are highly visible in the ventricles and it was previously identiﬁed as one of the most
important region for biological brain age prediction tasks (Levakov et al., 2020). We choose"

reduce the computational time, resources, and number of datasets needed to train the model.
Finally, the patches were centered and scaled using the mean and the standard deviation
of the grey values of each dataset."
RESULTS/EXPERIMENTS,0.4,3.3. Model training
RESULTS/EXPERIMENTS,0.41333333333333333,"The autoencoder architecture used in this work was adapted from a state-of-the-art age
regression CNN (Cole et al., 2017). More speciﬁcally, the encoder is made of three con-
secutive blocks each including: two three-dimensional convolutional layers with (3×3×3)
kernels and ReLu activation, one batch normalization layer, and one (2×2×2) max pooling
layer. The convolutional layers from the ﬁrst block have eight ﬁlters each, and this number
is doubled for each subsequent block. Finally, a convolutional layer with a (3×3×3) kernel,
three ﬁlters, and ReLu activation reduces the latent space size to 1620 units. The decoder
is made of the same architecture as the encoder but is mirrored and ends with one addi-
tional convolutional layer with one ﬁlter that outputs the reconstructed MRI scan. The
latent space disentanglement module is made of two dense layers of 1620 units with shared
weights, guaranteeing their invertibility.
The data were randomly split into a training, a validation, and a test set containing
respectively 1535, 383, and 200 datasets. In a ﬁrst step, the autoencoder alone was pre-
trained using a batch size of 28, and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.005 for
400 epochs. Then, the latent space representations of the training and validation datasets
were saved and used to train the latent space disentanglement module with a batch size
of 128 and a learning rate of 0.001, over 3000 epochs. Finally, joint training of the latent
space disentanglement module and the autoencoder was performed to ﬁne-tune the weights
of both parts using a smaller learning rate of 0.0001.
The generative component of the model uses a Gaussian mixture model with 10 com-
ponents and full covariance. The Gaussian mixture model representing the distribution of
the age-unrelated components was ﬁtted using the training datasets. More speciﬁcally, the
datasets were passed through the encoder and latent space disentanglement module and
their age-unrelated components were used to train the Gaussian mixture model.

RESULTS/EXPERIMENTS,0.44,"The age prediction ability of the ﬁnal model was tested on 200 hold out datasets from
the SHIP database and 563 datasets from the IXI database. More precisely, the results
of the model with and without joint training of the autoencoder and the latent space
disentanglement module were compared. Therefore, the age component of the disentangled
latent space was extracted and compared to the chronological age of each subject using the
mean absolute error and the coeﬃcient of determination (R2). For baseline comparison of
the results, a ground truth CNN model with the same architecture as the encoder (Cole
et al., 2017) and an additional one-unit dense layer with a linear activation to output the
predicted age was trained, validated, and tested on the same datasets (Table 1)."

RESULTS/EXPERIMENTS,0.6266666666666667,"In addition to generating age-conditioned templates with an average anatomy, our model
is also capable of simulating subject-speciﬁc aging eﬀects. More speciﬁcally, this is done
by sampling age-unrelated components from the Gaussian mixture model, and setting the
age-related component to diﬀerent values. Those latent space representations are then fed
through the latent space disentanglement module and the decoder (Figure 1 B) to generate
the simulated images. An example can be seen in Figure 4 where the age-related component
was set to 30, 50, and 70 years, and the age-unrelated components remained constant, to
simulate the aging process for a speciﬁc subject. The simulated datasets show realistic aging
eﬀects with increasing volume of the ventricle while the components unrelated to age (e.g.
shape diﬀerence in the left and right inferior part of the ventricles) remain unchanged."

CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION ,0.6533333333333333,4. Discussion and conclusion
CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION ,0.6666666666666666,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to estimate biological brain age, generate age-
speciﬁc MRI templates, and simulate MRI scans conditioned on age. Our approach employs
well-known deep neural network techniques and results in competitive age prediction and
realistic MRI simulation using a single model. We showed that using a deterministic model
leads to comparable results described in literature, in which more complex models were
used (Zhao et al., 2019; Wilms et al., 2020).
The age prediction estimation of the proposed method is comparable to the results
of the baseline CNN model for the SHIP data, and better for the independent test data,
highlighting the generalizability of the model. The results of previous models achieving
the same task on similar data but using the full brain instead of a cropped patch (Wilms
et al., 2020) are also comparable to ours.
Additionally, the joint training signiﬁcantly
improves the predictions (Table 1), illustrating the importance of simultaneously training
the autoencoder and the latent space disentanglement module, as the deepest layers of the
autoencoder can adapt to generate better age disentanglement without deteriorating the
image reconstruction quality.
The age-speciﬁc templates (Figure 2) show natural age-related shape variations with an
increased ventricular volume and wider sulci associated with increasing age, demonstrating
the age disentanglement ability of the model. The model was also able to capture the non-
linear aging trend as shown by the non-linear volume increase of the lateral ventricles in
Figure 3, in line with previously observed trends (Pfeﬀerbaum et al., 2013).
Finally, the simulated MRI scans (Figure 4) look realistic and the age-related changes
are visible while the subject-speciﬁc anatomy remains nearly unchanged. This indicates a
successful disentanglement of the age-related and unrelated factors of variation.
In general, our results show that the proposed model is able to generate realistic images
while also producing highly accurate age predictions. In future work, we plan to increase
our training and testing database, as well as to improve the model training parameters
in order to achieve an even more accurate latent space disentanglement. Additionally, we
plan to investigate counterfactuals, which can easily be generated with the current model
architecture and bring explainability to the biological brain age prediction task. Potential
further applications of the model include disentanglement of other factors than age, or of
several factors simultaneously."
