INTRODUCTION,0.04375,"Face recognition (FR) [5, 31, 18, 21, 13] technology has improved steadily over the past few years.

INTRODUCTION,0.04583333333333333,"It has been widely applied in a large number of personal or commercial scenarios for enhancing
22"
INTRODUCTION,0.04791666666666667,"user experience. Recent studies [3, 27, 36] indicated that existing FR models can remember the
23"
INTRODUCTION,0.05,"information from the training data, making them vulnerable to some privacy attacks such as model
24"
INTRODUCTION,0.052083333333333336,"extraction attacks [29], model inversion attacks [6], attribute inference attacks [7] (also known as
25"
INTRODUCTION,0.05416666666666667,"property inference attacks) and membership inference attacks [26]. As a result, malicious attackers
26"
INTRODUCTION,0.05625,"may be able to obtain users’ private information through the use of certain attacks, which could cause
27"
INTRODUCTION,0.058333333333333334,"significant damage. In order to facilitate the development of privacy-preserving FR methods, it is
28"
INTRODUCTION,0.06041666666666667,"essential to evaluate the leakage of the private information quantitatively. This motivates this study
29"
INTRODUCTION,0.0625,"which leads to the establishment of novel inference attacks to quantify such privacy leakage.
30"
INTRODUCTION,0.06458333333333334,"Inference attacks on machine learning algorithms can be roughly categorized into membership

INTRODUCTION,0.06666666666666667,"inference attacks and model inversion attacks [24]. We shall focus on both types of attacks against
32"
INTRODUCTION,0.06875,"FR models. The goal of a membership inference attack is to infer whether a record is included in

target is the backbone, while traditional attacks focus on the output of the classification layer which
can be removed in the generalized FR process."
INTRODUCTION,0.09791666666666667,"At present, both types of attacks against FR usually rely on the presence of a classification layer. In
37"
INTRODUCTION,0.1,"other words, the performance of the attack and the corresponding defense algorithms [33] is heavily
38"
INTRODUCTION,0.10208333333333333,"dependent on utilizing the output from logits in the classification layer or the labels themselves
39"
INTRODUCTION,0.10416666666666667,"[4]. Nevertheless, FR has completely different training and inference paradigms, as shown in Fig.1.
40"
INTRODUCTION,0.10625,"Existing face recognition techniques do include a classifier after the feature extraction network
41"
INTRODUCTION,0.10833333333333334,"(backbone) in training, but the classifier is not used during inference. Instead, they extract feature
42"
INTRODUCTION,0.11041666666666666,"embeddings from the image pair using the trained backbone, then calculate their similarity based
43"
INTRODUCTION,0.1125,"on certain metrics to determine whether the two images are from the same person to achieve FR.
44"
INTRODUCTION,0.11458333333333333,"Therefore, in a realistic setup, the attacker can only acquire the feature embedding of the query
45"
INTRODUCTION,0.11666666666666667,"image and has no access to the discarded classification layer. The aforementioned difference in the
46"
INTRODUCTION,0.11875,"paradigms of training and inference for FR brings significant challenges to the current attack methods,
47"
INTRODUCTION,0.12083333333333333,"because there is evidence [8] indicating that compared with logits and losses, the feature embedding,
48"
INTRODUCTION,0.12291666666666666,"as a more general representation, contains less information about the training data. Moreover, the
49"
INTRODUCTION,0.125,"training stage of an FR system is essentially a closed-set classification problem, while the inference
50"
INTRODUCTION,0.12708333333333333,"phase becomes a more complicated open-set problem. In summary, performing inference attacks
51"
INTRODUCTION,0.12916666666666668,"against FR without exploiting the classification layer is non-trivial but practically important.
52"
INTRODUCTION,0.13125,"In this paper, we shall propose a novel two-stage attack algorithm, and its diagram is shown in Fig.2.
53"
INTRODUCTION,0.13333333333333333,"The first stage is the membership inference attack. Compared to previous attack methods that focus on
54"
INTRODUCTION,0.13541666666666666,"the classification layer of the target model, we explore the inherent relationship between the backbone
55"
INTRODUCTION,0.1375,"output of the target model and the training data set. Specifically, we first analyze the distribution of

57"
INTRODUCTION,0.14166666666666666,"stored in the Batch Normalization layer in the trained backbone, and found it critical for membership

INTRODUCTION,0.14375,"inference. We then design an attack model to determine whether a sample belongs to the training data
59"

60"
INTRODUCTION,0.14791666666666667,"of prior knowledge including partial access to training data set and no access to training data set. In
61"
INTRODUCTION,0.15,"both cases, the proposed membership attack is efficient and can provide state-of-the-art performance.
62"
INTRODUCTION,0.15208333333333332,"The second stage is the model inversion attack. Previous model inversion attacks against FR such as
63"
INTRODUCTION,0.15416666666666667,"those from [28, 1, 17] are heavily dependent on the classifier of the target model. They often guide
64"
INTRODUCTION,0.15625,"the optimization of the attack network using the logit of the classifier’s output or some well-designed
65"
INTRODUCTION,0.15833333333333333,"loss functions based on the logit. For the FR models in consideration, none of these approaches are
