ABSTRACT,0.0,Abstract
ABSTRACT,0.001876172607879925,"Ensuring safety is a key aspect in sequential decision making problems, such
as robotics or process control. The complexity of the underlying systems often
makes finding the optimal decision challenging, especially when the safety-critical
system is time-varying. Overcoming the problem of optimizing an unknown
time-varying reward subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints, we pro-
pose TVSAFEOPT, a new algorithm built on Bayesian optimization with a spatio-
temporal kernel. The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe
region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are
also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary.
We show that TVSAFEOPT compares favorably against SAFEOPT on synthetic
data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study
with gas compressors confirms that TVSAFEOPT ensures safety when solving
time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions."

INTRODUCTION,0.005628517823639775,"We seek to interactively optimize an unknown time-varying reward function f : X × T →R, where
X is a finite set of decisions, and T := {0, 1, 2, . . . , T}, T ∈N+ denotes the discretized time

evaluated decisions must satisfy with high probability. Similar to the reward, the constraints are also
unknown and potentially time-varying, encoded through ci : X × T →R, i ∈Ic := {1, 2, . . . , m},
where m ∈N+ denotes the number of safety constraints. The optimization problem at time t is"

its safety and optimality guarantees by framing contextual SBO as distinct SBO sub-problems.

Methodology and Contributions"
METHODOLOGY AND CONTRIBUTIONS,0.06191369606003752,"Methodology We propose the TVSAFEOPT algorithm to optimize an unknown time-varying reward
subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints. The algorithm focuses on Time-Varying Safe
Bayesian Optimization (TVSBO). TVSAFEOPT utilizes a spatio-temporal kernel and time Lipschitz
constants as prior knowledge about how the problem depends on time. The temporal part of the kernel
encodes the continuity of the functions with time while the Lipschitz constants explicitly provide upper
bounds on how fast the functions may change. Instead of considering safe sets at previous iteration as
safe at the current iteration, which might lead to unsafe decisions, TVSAFEOPT robustly subtracts the
safety margin when updating the safe sets (Figure 1). In this way, the algorithm is capable of adapting
in real time and guarantees safety even when exploring the safe region of non-stationary problems."

Implementation details are described in Appendix A. Figure 1 illustrates that the safe sets computed
by TVSAFEOPT are contained in the ground truth safe regions while those computed by SAFEOPT
and ETSAFEOPT have multiple violations. Due to the dependence on time of the example (Figure 3),
the initial safe set becomes unsafe at t = 30, and t = 170. Taking the possible changes in time
into consideration, TVSAFEOPT correctly identifies the possible unsafety of the initial safe set. In
contrast, SAFEOPT always consider the initial safe set to be safe. Meanwhile, ETSAFEOPT correctly
identifies the lack of safety of the initial safe set at t = 30, but fails at t = 170. This is because
the event trigger is naturally insensitive to continuous changes. This toy example indicates that,
in contrast to SAFEOPT and ETSAFEOPT, TVSAFEOPT safely adapts to the time changes of the

ETSAFEOPT is not applicable to this case study because the magnitude of changes in the demand Mt,
compressor head Ht, and degradation dit keeps triggering the event trigger and thus the maintained
safe set becomes empty very quickly. Implementation details are described in Appendix A. Figure 2
compares the number of unsafe decisions in the safe sets calculated by TVSAFEOPT, SAFEOPT, and
approximate optimization. We see that, by considering the uncertainty with respect to the decision
variables, SAFEOPT maintains fewer unsafe decisions in its safe sets than the approximate optimiza-
tion. However, SAFEOPT tends to expand its safe sets regardless of external changes. TVSAFEOPT
further improves this based on SAFEOPT by taking into consideration the time-varying safety func-
tions. TVSAFEOPT robustly shrinks its safe sets based on its observations and thus maintains much"

In the compressor case study, TVSAFEOPT overall finds lower reward function values than SAFEOPT
and approximate optimization, which is consistent with the fact that it covers a lower fraction of the
ground truth safe regions and the reward function changes significantly between iterations. Because
of its strong focus on safety, TVSAFEOPT deviates more from the ground truth. The cumulative regret
of TVSAFEOPT is above the one of SAFEOPT by 42.1%, and the one of approximate optimization
by 178.3%. This illustrates the trade-off between safety and optimality in the presence of strong
uncertainties due to the varying reward and safety constraints. Quantitative metrics using Approximate

Limitations and Conclusion"
LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSION,0.29831144465290804,"Limitations The compressor case study demonstrated that TVSAFEOPT ensures safety at the expense
of optimality if the stationarity assumption is not satisfied. The assumption about the local stationarity
of the optimization problem (1) is thus the main limitation. Even though TVSAFEOPT demonstrates
good empirical performance with respect to safety even when the problem is non-stationary,
theoretical guarantee for its near-optimality in the non-stationary case warrant further investigation."
LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSION,0.300187617260788,"The need for obtaining the Lipschitz constants with respect to both x and t in order to compute the
safe set Sk in (6) may prove limiting in real applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose
practical modifications in Appendix A.1."
LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSION,0.30206378986866794,"Conclusions We propose TVSAFEOPT algorithm, which extends SAFEOPT to handle time-varying
optimization problems. In conclusion, TVSAFEOPT outperforms SAFEOPT in terms of adaptation to
changes in time and maintains fewer unsafe decisions in its safe sets for time-varying problems. This
is at the cost of covering less of the ground truth safe regions and may lead to poorer performance
in terms of optimality."
LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSION,0.30393996247654786,"We prove the safety guarantee for TVSAFEOPT in the general time-varying setting and prove its
near-optimality guarantee for the case in which the optimization problem becomes stationary. The
two theoretical results together guarantee that TVSAFEOPT is capable of safely transferring safety
of the decisions into the future and, based on the transferred safe sets, it will find the near-optimal
decision when the reward function stops changing. We show that TVSAFEOPT performs well in
practice for the most general settings where both the reward function and the safety constraint are
time-varying, both on synthetic data and for real case study on a gas compressor."

Trade-off between Safety and Optimality"
X,0.8180112570356473,"In this work, we focus on safety critical systems where satisfying the safety constraints has highest
priority over finding the optima. Through pessimistically considering change with time in the decision-
making process, TVSAFEOPT emphasizes safety in non-stationary conditions at the inevitable expense
of optimality. In practice, such sacrifice on optimality can be alleviated by tighter bound of rate of
change."
X,0.8198874296435272,"Besides, in the case where safety can be to some extent comprised, which is beyond the focus of this
work, constrained BO and its time-varying extension would be a more suitable method to apply. We
refer the readers to [50, 51] for further information."

Scalability"
X,0.8236397748592871,"Explicit considering time can be viewed roughly as adding dimension by 1, Therefore, TVSAFEOPT
achieves time adaptation without adding much computational cost. With the increase in dimensionality
of the problem, safety constraints might arise across multiple dimensions, from multiple directions at
the price of optimality. As our approach is suitable for safety critical conditions, the focus is put on
maintaining safety under change, therefore safety considerations “dictate” the optima. Additionally,
in practice, the safety functions are modeled independently with a GP, and thus the computational
cost scales linearly with the number of constraints."

• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.

and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations."

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8705440900562852,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset)."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8724202626641651,"(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results."

(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."

that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
