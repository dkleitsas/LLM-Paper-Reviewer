ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0027397260273972603,"In model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, using noisy value es-
timates to supervise policy evaluation and optimization is detrimental to the sam-
ple efficiency. As this noise is heteroscedastic, its effects can be mitigated using
uncertainty-based weights in the optimization process. Previous methods rely on
sampled ensembles, which do not capture all aspects of uncertainty. We provide
a systematic analysis of the sources of uncertainty in the noisy supervision that
occurs in RL, and introduce inverse-variance RL, a Bayesian framework which
combines probabilistic ensembles and Batch Inverse Variance weighting. We pro-
pose a method whereby two complementary uncertainty estimation methods ac-
count for both the Q-value and the environment stochasticity to better mitigate the
negative impacts of noisy supervision. Our results show significant improvement
in terms of sample efficiency on discrete and continuous control tasks."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.00821917808219178,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have proven to be powerful at solving sequential
decision-making tasks across domains (Silver et al., 2016; OpenAI et al., 2019). Combining the
flexibility of the reinforcement learning framework with the representational power of deep neural
networks enables policy optimization in complex and high-dimensional environments with unknown
dynamics models to maximize the expected cumulative reward (Sutton & Barto, 2018)."
INTRODUCTION,0.010958904109589041,"An important limitation of DRL methods is their sample inefficiency: an enormous amount of data is
necessary and makes training expensive. This makes applying DRL in the real world challenging, for
example in robotics (S¨underhauf et al., 2018; Dulac-Arnold et al., 2019). In tasks like manipulation,
sample collection is a slow and costly process (Liu et al., 2021). It is even more expensive in risk-
averse applications like autonomous driving (Kothari et al., 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.0136986301369863,"Among the current state-of-the-art approaches to improve learning efficiency, a promising direction
is to exploit the prevalence of uncertainty in the underlying DRL algorithm. By adopting a Bayesian
framework, we can consider the sampled quantities in DRL as random variables and leverage infor-
mation about their distributions to improve the learning process (Osband et al., 2018). In this paper,
we consider the particular problem of unreliable supervision in the temporal difference update and
the policy optimization process. In DRL, value predictions are used to supervise the training: in tem-
poral difference-based algorithms, they are included in bootstrapped target values which are used as
labels; in actor-critic frameworks, the policy is trained to optimize them. That these value predic-
tions are noisy slows the learning and brings instability (Kumar et al., 2019; 2020). The amount of
noise in the supervision depends on the uncertainty of the value prediction, which evolves during
the training process and depends on the state (and action) evaluated. It is therefore heteroscedastic."
INTRODUCTION,0.01643835616438356,"While there is an extensive body of literature focused on using the uncertainty of the value prediction
to guide the exploration/exploitation trade-off (Dearden et al., 1998; Strens, 2001; Osband et al.,
2016; Pathak et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Osband et al., 2018; Fortunato et al., 2019; Osband
et al., 2019; Flennerhag et al., 2020; Clements et al., 2020; Jain et al., 2021; Aravindan & Lee, 2021),
there are very few works focused on leveraging it to mitigate the impact of unreliable supervision."

INTRODUCTION,0.024657534246575342,"Distributional RL (Bellemare et al., 2017) considers the value function as a distribution to be learned
as such. It is orthogonal to our proposition: we consider the uncertainty of the labels used to learn
a scalar value function. In the offline RL setting, where the dataset is limited, uncertainty-weighted
actor-critic (UWAC) (Wu et al., 2021) uses inverse-variance weighting to discard out-of-distribution
state-action pairs using Monte Carlo dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) for uncertainty estimation."
INTRODUCTION,0.0273972602739726,"Closer to our work, Lee et al. (2021) propose SUNRISE, in which each sample of the Bellman
backup in the TD update step is weighted to lower the importance of the targets which have a high
standard deviation. The weights w(s′, a′) are computed based on a sigmo¨ıd of the negative standard
deviation ˆQstd(s′, a′) scaled by a temperature hyperparameter T, and then offset such that they are
between 0.5 and 1: w(s, a) = σ(−ˆQstd(s′, a′) ∗T) + 0.5. The uncertainty of the target is estimated
by sampled ensembles. While SUNRISE proposes other contributions such as an exploration bonus,
the heuristic weighting scheme and the limitations of sampled ensembles in capturing the predictive
uncertainty leave space for improvement in the mitigation of the effects of unreliable supervision."
INTRODUCTION,0.030136986301369864,"We propose inverse-variance reinforcement learning (IV-RL). IV-RL also uses weights to reduce the
importance of uncertain targets in training. It does so by addressing the problem from two view-
points. First, we use variance networks (Kendall & Gal, 2017), whose loss function for regression
is the negative log-likelihood instead of the L2 distance. For a given state-action pair (s, a), the
network learns the target’s noise, due for example to the stochasticity of the environment or the up-
date of the policy. It then naturally down-weights the highly noisy samples in the training process.
Second, we use variance ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) to estimate the uncertainty of
the target due to the prediction of Q(s′, a′) during the temporal-difference update. We merge the
predicted variances of several variance networks through a mixture of Gaussians, which has been
shown to be a reliable method to capture predictive uncertainty (Ovadia et al., 2019). We then use
Batch Inverse-Variance (BIV) (Mai et al., 2021), which has been shown to significantly improve the
performance of supervised learning with neural networks in the case of heteroscedastic regression.
BIV is normalized, which makes it ideal to cope with different and time-varying scales of variance.
We show analytically that these two different variance predictions for the target are complementary
and their combination leads to consistent and significant improvements in the sample efficiency and
overall performance of the learning process."
INTRODUCTION,0.03287671232876712,"In summary, our contribution is threefold:"
WE PRESENT A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE SUPERVISION OF MODEL-,0.03561643835616438,"1. We present a systematic analysis of the sources of uncertainty in the supervision of model-
free DRL algorithms. We show that the variance of the supervision noise can be estimated
with two complementary methods: negative log-likelihood and variance ensembles.
2. We introduce IV-RL, a framework that accounts for the uncertainty of the supervisory sig-
nal by weighting the samples in a mini-batch during the agent’s training. IV-RL uses BIV,
a weighting scheme that is robust to poorly calibrated variance estimation.1"

other samples, thus increasing EBS. With a very high ξ compared to the variances, all weights are
equal, and EBS tends towards K; in this case, the BIV loss tends towards L2."
BATCH INVERSE-VARIANCE WEIGHTING,0.09315068493150686,"Tuning the ξ parameter
The simplest way to set ξ is to choose a constant value as an additional
hyperparameter. However, the best value is difficult to evaluate a priori and can change when the
profile of variances changes during a task, as is the case in DRL."
BATCH INVERSE-VARIANCE WEIGHTING,0.0958904109589041,"It is instead possible to numerically compute the value of ξ which ensures a minimal EBS for each
mini-batch. This method allows ξ to automatically adapt to the different scales of variance while
ensuring a minimal amount of information from the dataset is accounted for by the algorithm. The
minimal EBS is also a hyper-parameter, but it is easier to set and to transfer among environments,
as it is simply a fraction of the original batch size. As such, it can be set as a batch size ratio."

ESTIMATING THE UNCERTAINTY OF A NEURAL NETWORK PREDICTION,0.10136986301369863,"The predictive uncertainty of a neural network can be considered as the combination of aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainties (Kendall & Gal, 2017). Aleatoric uncertainty is irreducible and characterizes
the non-deterministic relationship between the input and the desired output. Epistemic uncertainty is
instead related to the trained model: it depends on the information available in the training data, the
model’s capacity to retain it, and the learning algorithm (H¨ullermeier & Waegeman, 2021). There is
currently no principled way to quantify the amount of task-related information present in the input,
the training data, or the model. The state of the art for predictive uncertainty estimation instead
relies on different sorts of proxies. These sometimes capture other elements, such as the noise of the
labels, which we can use to our advantage. We focus here on the relevant methods to our work."

SAMPLED ENSEMBLES,0.1178082191780822,"When used at the very beginning of the training process, sampled ensembles present one particular
challenge: as the networks are initialized, they all predict small values. The initial variance, instead
of capturing the lack of knowledge, is then underestimated. To address this problem, Randomized
Prior Functions (RPFs) enforce a prior in the variance by pairing each network with a fixed, untrained
network which adds its predictions to the output (Osband et al., 2019). RPFs ensure a high variance
at regions of the input space which are not well explored, and a lower variance when the trained
networks have learned to compensate for their respective prior and converge to the same output. The
scale of the prior is a hyper-parameter.3"

epistemic variance estimation. However, compared to variance networks, they seem empirically

not have seen enough samples to have an accurate approximation of Qπ(s′, a′). This corresponds
to an epistemic source of uncertainty that should be captured by sampled ensembles. However, as
π is updated, the regression target, Qπ(s′, a′), is also changing. This can be interpreted as variabil-
ity in the underlying process which will be captured by var-networks. We can thus combine both
sampling-based and var-network methods and evaluate σ2

VARIANCE OF THE TARGET,0.2328767123287671,"Stochastic environment and policy
The other potential source of variance in the target is the
result of the stochasticity of the environment encapsulated by pR (r|s, a) and pS′(s′|s, a) and of the
policy represented by π(a′|s′). Note that in model-free RL, we have no explicit representation of
pR (r|s, a) or pS′(s′|s, a), which are necessary to estimate this source of uncertainty."
VARIANCE OF THE TARGET,0.2356164383561644,"Qπ(s, a) is defined as the expected value of the return. As a result, even in the case where ¯Q(s′, a′)
= Qπ(s, a) in (4), there is still noise over the value of the target that is being used as the label due to
the stochasticity of the environment and policy that generate r, a′ and s′. Assuming a zero mean and
normally distributed noise, this underlying stochasticity of the generating process is well-captured
by a var-network with a loss attenuation using the negative log-likelihood formulation described in

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.38904109589041097,"We present Inverse Variance Reinforcement Learning (IV-RL), a framework for model-free deep
reinforcement learning which leverages uncertainty estimation to enhance sample efficiency and
performance. A thorough analysis of the sources of noise that contribute to errors in the target mo-
tivates the use of a combination of Batch Inverse Variance (BIV) weighting and variance ensembles
to estimate the variance of the target and down weight the uncertain samples in two complementary
ways. Our results show that these two components are beneficial and that their combination signif-
icantly improves the state of the art in terms of learning efficiency, in particular for control tasks.
We applied IV-RL to DQN and SAC, but it can be adapted to any model-free algorithm. Model-
based, active or continuous learning could also benefit from the underlying ideas presented in this
paper. We thus believe that IV-RL is a significant step to enable the application of DRL to real-world
problems such as robotics, where sample efficiency is the main challenge."

reliable."

very high λ leads to poor performance and never reach the goal score of 200. For SlimHumanoid,
both extremes show inferior performance to when λ = 10, but, although there are differences in the
dynamics, they reach similar a score after 200k steps. In Walker, high λ is also slower, however,

power of the weights. For example, if all variances are smaller than β, all weights are clipped and
become identical at 1.5, and the weighting scheme does not discriminate between certain and un-
certain samples. On the other hand, if most variances are very high compared to β, the weights will
be very low. A single low-variance sample may thus completely outweigh all other samples, which

are separate: we tell the agent to go where the Q(s, a) is uncertain, and then to sample a target
T(s, a) by projecting over the next time step with Q(s′, a′). T(s, a) has its own uncertainty, which
is not that of Q(s, a). If the agent believes T(s, a) is highly uncertain, it should not give it too much
weight. T(s, a) may also have low uncertainty: the agent will then give it more importance."

cause the uncertainty of Q(s, a) and the uncertainty of Q(s′, a′) to be similar, especially if (s, a)

IV-RL and OFU, which may not be completely decoupled."

uncertainties of Q(s, a) and T(s, a)."
REFERENCES,0.9945205479452055,"As an empirical element to this answer, we show in the paper that OFU and IV-RL work together:
the IV-SAC experiments include a UCB bonus for exploration. It is to be noted that, if these two
strategies can conflict, IV-RL proposes the use of hyperparameter MEBS which allows us to control
the intensity of its discrimination. By increasing the MEBS, one can give more importance to high-
variance samples, and find an optimal balance."

according to variance in DRL and could be an interesting line of future investigation."
