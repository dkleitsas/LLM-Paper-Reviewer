ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.006172839506172839,"The sequential recommendation aims at predicting the next items in user behav-
iors, which can be solved by characterizing item relationships in sequences. Due
to the data sparsity and noise issues in sequences, a new self-supervised learning
(SSL) paradigm is proposed to improve the performance, which employs con-
trastive learning between positive and negative views of sequences. However,
existing methods all construct views by adopting augmentation from data per-
spectives, while we argue that 1) optimal data augmentation methods are hard to
devise, 2) data augmentation methods destroy sequential correlations, and 3) data
augmentation fails to incorporate comprehensive self-supervised signals. There-
fore, we investigate the possibility of model augmentation to construct view pairs.
We propose three levels of model augmentation methods: neuron masking, layer
dropping, and encoder complementing. This work opens up a novel direction in
constructing views for contrastive SSL. Experiments verify the efﬁcacy of model
augmentation for the SSL in the sequential recommendation."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.018518518518518517,"The sequential recommendation (Fan et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021c; Chen et al., 2018; Tang &
Wang, 2018; Zheng et al., 2019) aims at predicting future items in sequences, where the crucial part
is to characterize item relationships in sequences. Recent developments in sequence modeling (Fan
et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021c) verify the superiority of Transform (Vaswani et al., 2017), i.e. the self-
attention mechanism, in revealing item correlations in sequences. A Transformer (Kang & McAuley,
2018) is able to infer the sequence embedding at speciﬁed positions by weighted aggregation of item
embeddings, where the weights are learned via self-attention. Existing works (Fan et al., 2021; Wu
et al., 2020) further improve Transformer by incorporating additional complex signals."
INTRODUCTION,0.024691358024691357,"However, the data sparsity issue (Liu et al., 2021c) and noise in sequences undermine the perfor-
mance of a model in sequential recommendation. The former hinders performance due to insuf-
ﬁcient training since the complex structure of a sequential model requires a dense corpus to be
adequately trained. The latter also impedes the recommendation ability of a model because noisy
item sequences are unable to reveal actual item correlations. To overcome both, a new contrastive
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm (Liu et al., 2021b; Xie et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020)
is proposed recently. This paradigm enhances the capacity of encoders by leveraging additional
self-supervised signals. Speciﬁcally, the SSL paradigm constructs positive view pairs as two data
augmentations from the same sequences (Xie et al., 2020), while negative pairs are augmentations
from distinct sequences. Incorporating augmentations during training increases the amount of train-
ing data, thus alleviating the sparsity issue. And the contrastive loss (Chen et al., 2020) improves
the robustness of the model, which endows a model with the ability to against noise."
INTRODUCTION,0.030864197530864196,"Though being effective in enhancing sequential modeling, the data augmentation methods adopted
in the existing SSL paradigm suffer from the following weaknesses:"
INTRODUCTION,0.037037037037037035,"• Optimal data augmentation methods are hard to devise. Current sequence augmentation meth-
ods adopts random sequence perturbations (Liu et al., 2021b; Xie et al., 2020), which includes
crop, mask, reorder, substitute and insert operations. Though a random combination of those aug-
menting operations improves the performance, it is rather time-consuming to search the optimal"

et al., 2021b)."
INTRODUCTION,0.05555555555555555,"• Data augmentation methods destroy sequential correlations, leading to less conﬁdent positive
pairs. The existing SSL paradigm requires injecting perturbations into the augmented views of
sequences for contrastive learning. However, because the view construction process is not opti-
mized to characterize sequential correlations, two views of one sequence may reveal distinct item
relationships, which should not be recognized as positive pairs."
INTRODUCTION,0.06172839506172839,"• Data augmentation fails to incorporate comprehensive self-supervised signals. Current data aug-
mentation methods are designed based on heuristics, which already requires additional prior
knowledge. Moreover, since the view construction process is not optimized with the encoder,
data augmentation may only reveal partial self-supervised signals from data perspectives. Hence,
we should consider other types of views besides data augmentation."
INTRODUCTION,0.06790123456790123,"Therefore, we investigate the possibility of model augmentation to construct view pairs for con-
trastive learning, which functions as a complement to the data augmentation methods. We hypothe-
sis that injecting perturbations into the encoder should enhance the self-supervised learning ability to
existing paradigms. The reasons are threefold: Firstly, model augmentation is jointly trained with the
optimization process, thus endows the end-to-end training fashion. As such, it is easy to discover the
optimal view pairs for contrastive learning. Secondly, model augmentation constructs views without
manipulation to the original data, which leads to high conﬁdence of positive pairs. Last but not
least, injecting perturbation into the encoder has distinct characteristics to data augmentation, which
should be an important complement in constructing view pairs for existing self-supervised learning
scheme (Liu et al., 2021b; Zhou et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.07407407407407407,"This work studies the model augmentation for a self-supervised sequential recommendation from
three levels: 1) neuron masking (dropout), which adopts the dropout layer to randomly mask par-
tial neurons in a layer. By operating the dropout twice to one sequence, we can perturb the output
of the embedding from this layer, which thus constructs two views from model augmentation per-
spective (Gao et al., 2021). 2) layer dropping. Compared with neuron masks, we randomly drop
a complete layer in the encoder to inject more perturbations. By randomly dropping layers in an
encoder twice, we construct two distinct views. Intuitively, layer-drop augmentation enforces the
contrast between deep features and shallows features of the encoder. 3) encoder complementing,
which leverages other encoders to generate sequence embeddings. Encoder complementing aug-
mentation is able to fuse distinct sequential correlations revealed by different types of encoders.
For example, RNN-based sequence encoder (Hidasi et al., 2015) can better characterize direct item
transition relationships, while Transformer-based sequence encoder models position-wise sequen-
tial correlations. Though only investigating SSL for a sequential recommendation, we remark that
model augmentation methods can also be applied in other SSL scenarios. The contributions are as
follows:"

SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING,0.1419753086419753,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) is proposed recently to describe “the machine predicts any parts of
its input for any observed part”(Bengio et al., 2021), which stays within the narrow scope of unsu-
pervised learning. To achieve the self-prediction, endeavors from various domains have developed
different SSL schemes from either generative or contrastive perspectives (Liu et al., 2021a). For
generative SSL, the masked language model is adopted in BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) to generate
masked words in sentences. GPT-GNN (Hu et al., 2020) also generates masked edges to realize SSL.
Other generative SSL paradigms in computer vision (Oord et al., 2016) are proposed. Compared
with generative SSL, contrastive SSL schemes have demonstrated more promising performance.
SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) proposes simple contrastive learning between augmented views for im-
ages, which is rather effective in achieving SSL. GCC (Qiu et al., 2020) and GraphCL (You et al.,
2020) adopts contrastive learning between views from corrupted graph structures. CL4SRec (Xie
et al., 2020) and CoSeRec (Liu et al., 2021b) devise the sequence augmentation methods for SSL
on sequential recommendation. This paper also investigates the contrastive SSL for a sequential
recommendation. Instead of adopting the data augmentation for constructing views to contrast, we
propose the model augmentation to generate contrastive views."

substitute sequence augmentations. For sequential recommendation, since both SSL and the next-
item prediction charaterize the item relationships in sequences, we add them together to optimize

gues that most recommender systems require only shallow embeddings for users and items (Dacrema
et al., 2019). Therefore, it is reasonable to randomly drop a fraction of layers during training, which
functions as a way of regularization. Additionally, existing works (Liu et al., 2020; He et al., 2016)
claim that embeddings at shallow layers and deep layers are both important to reﬂect the compre-
hensive information of the data. Dropping layers enable contrastive learning between shallow em-

contrasting on one single encoder may result in embedding collapse problems for self-supervised
learning (Hua et al., 2021). Moreover, one single encoder is only able to reﬂect the item relationships
from a unitary perspective. For example, the Transformer encoder adopts the attentive aggregation
of item embeddings to infer sequence embedding, while an RNN structure (Hidasi et al., 2015) is
more suitable in encoding direct item transitions. Therefore, contrasting between views from distinct
encoders enables the model to learn comprehensive sequential relationships of items."
ENCODER COMPLEMENTING,0.49382716049382713,"However, embeddings from two views of a sequence with distinct encoders lead to a non-Siamese
paradigm for self-supervised learning, which is hard to train and suffers the embedding collapse
problem (Koch et al., 2015; Chen & He, 2021). Additionally, if two distinct encoders reveal sig-
niﬁcantly diverse sequential correlations, the embeddings are far away from each other, thus being
bad views for contrastive learning (Tian et al., 2020). Moreover, though we can optimize two en-
coders during a training phase, it is still problematic to combine them for the inference of sequence
embeddings to conduct recommendations."
ENCODER COMPLEMENTING,0.5,"As a result, instead of contrastive learning with distinct encoders, we harness another pre-trained
encoder as an encoder complementing model augmentation for the original encoder. To be more
speciﬁc, we ﬁrst pre-train another encoder with the next-item prediction target. Then, in the self-
supervised training stage, we utilize this pre-trained encoder to generate another embedding for a
view. After that, we add the view embeddings from a model encoder and the pre-trained encoder.
We illustrate the encoder complementing augmentation in Figure 1(d). Note that we only apply this
model augmentation in one branch of the SSL paradigm. And the embedding from the pre-trained
encoder is re-scaled by a hyper-parameter γ before adding to the embedding from the framework’s
encoder. The smaller value of γ implies injecting fewer perturbations from a distinct encoder. And
the parameters of this pre-trained encoder are ﬁxed during training. Hence, there is no optimization
for this pre-trained encoder and it is no longer required to take account of both encoders during the
inference stage."

Transformer-based sequence encoders, such SASRec and BERT4Rec are better than GRU4Rec or

as sequence encoder. Moreover, the SSL paradigm can signiﬁcantly improve performance. For

tation, SRMA thus outperforms all other SSL sequential recommendation models. SRMA adopts
the same data augmentation methods as CL4SRec. Nevertheless, SRMA signiﬁcantly outperforms
CL4SRec. On the sports dataset, we achieve 18.9% and 27.9% relative improvements on HR and
NDCG, respectively. On the Yelp dataset, we achieve 4.5% and 6.4% relative improvements on HR
and NDCG, respectively. And on Toys data, we achieve 8.6% and 13.8% relative improvements on
HR and NDCG, respectively. In addition, SRMA also performs better than CoSeRec which lever-
ages item correlations for data augmentation. Those results all verify the effectiveness of model
augmentation in improving the SSL paradigm."

COMPARISON BETWEEN MODEL AND DATA AUGMENTATION,0.6172839506172839,"Because SRMA adopts the random sequence augmentation, we mainly focus on comparing with
CL4SRec to justify the impacts of model augmentation and data augmentation. In fact, CL4SRec
also implicitly uses the neuron masking model augmentation, where dropout layers are stacked
within its original sequence encoder. To separate the joint effects of model and data augmentation,
we create its variants ‘CL4S. p = 0’, which sets all the dropout ratios to be 0, thus disables the neu-
ron masking augmentation. Also, another variant ‘CL4S. w/o D’, which has no data augmentation
are also compared. Additionally, we create two other variants of SRMA as ‘SRMA w/o M’ and
‘SRMA w/o D’ by disabling the model augmentation and data augmentation respectively. ‘SRMA
w/o M’ has additional FFN layers compared with ‘CL4S. p = 0’. The recommendation perfor-
mance on the Sports and Toys dataset is presented in Table 2. We have the following observations.
Firstly, we notice a signiﬁcant performance drop of the variant ‘CL4S. p = 0’, which suggests that
the neuron masking augmentation is rather crucial. It beneﬁts both the regularization of the training
encoder and model augmentation of SSL. Secondly, ‘SRMA w/o D’ outperforms other baselines on
the Sports dataset and has comparable performance to ‘CL4S.’, which indicates the model augmen-
tation is of more impact in the SSL paradigm compared with data augmentation. Thirdly, SRMA
performs the best against all the variants. This result suggests that we should jointly employ the data
augmentation and model augmentation in an SSL paradigm, which contributes to comprehensive
contrastive self-supervised signals."

the neuron masking augmentation is effective in improving the ability of the sequence encoder for a
recommendation. And the dropping of the performance indicates the intensity of model augmenta-
tion should not be overly aggressive, which may lead to less informative contrastive learning. As to
SASRec, we recognize a higher score of SASRec when p is large, which indicates the optimal model
augmentation should be a slightly perturbation rather than a intensive distortion. Moreover, SRMA
consistently outperforms SASRec when 0.1 < p < 0.6. Since the only difference is that SASRec
has no SSL module, we can thus concludes that the performance gains result from the contrastive
SSL step by using the neuron masking."
HYPER-PARAMETER SENSITIVITY,0.6790123456790124,"Effect of Layer Dropping. The layer dropping model augmentation is controlled by two hyper-
parameters, the number of additional FFN layers and the number of layers to drop during training,
which is denoted as K and M, respectively. Since we can only drop those additional layers, we
have M < K. We select K from {1, 2, 3, 4} while M are searched accordingly. Due to space
limitation, we only report the NDCG@5 on the Sports and Toys dataset in Figure 3. We observe
that K = 2, M = 1 achieves the best performance on both datasets, which implies the efﬁcacy of
layer dropping. Additionally, we also ﬁnd that the performance on K = 4 is consistently worse than
K = 2 on both datasets, which suggests that adding too many layers increases the complexity of the
model, which is thus unable to enhance the SSL paradigm."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.7469135802469136,"This work proposes a novel contrastive self-supervised learning paradigm, which simultaneously
employs model augmentation and data augmentation to construct views for contrasting. We pro-
pose three-level model augmentation methods for this paradigm, which are neuron masking, layer
dropping, and encoder complementing. We adopt this paradigm to the sequential recommendation
problem and propose a new model SRMA. This model adopts both the random data augmentation
of sequences and the corresponding three-level model augmentation for the sequence encoder. We
conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of SRMA. The overall performance
comparison justiﬁes the advantage of contrastive SSL with model augmentation. Additionally, de-
tailed investigation regarding the impacts of model augmentation and data augmentation in improv-
ing the performance are discussed. Moreover, ablation studies with respect to three-level model
augmentation methods are implemented, which also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
model. Overall, this work opens up a new direction in constructing views from model augmenta-
tion. We believe model augmentation can enhance existing contrastive SSL paradigms with only
data augmentation."
