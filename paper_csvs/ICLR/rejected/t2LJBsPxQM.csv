ABSTRACT,0.0012300123001230013,"Enforcing orthogonality in convolutional neural networks is an antidote for gra-
dient vanishing/exploding problems, sensitivity to perturbation, and bounding
generalization errors. Many previous approaches for orthogonal convolutions
enforce orthogonality on its ﬂattened kernel, which, however, do not lead to the
orthogonality of the operation. Some recent approaches consider orthogonality
for standard convolutional layers and propose speciﬁc classes of their realizations.
In this work, we propose a theoretical framework that establishes the equivalence
between diverse orthogonal convolutional layers in the spatial domain and the
paraunitary systems in the spectral domain. Since 1D paraunitary systems admit
a complete factorization, we can parameterize any separable orthogonal convolu-
tion as a composition of spatial ﬁlters. As a result, our framework endows high
expressive power to various convolutional layers while maintaining their exact
orthogonality. Furthermore, our layers are memory and computationally efﬁcient
for deep networks compared to previous designs. Our versatile framework, for the
ﬁrst time, enables the study of architectural designs for deep orthogonal networks,
such as choices of skip connection, initialization, stride, and dilation. Consequently,
we scale up orthogonal networks to deep architectures, including ResNet and Shuf-
ﬂeNet, substantially outperforming their shallower counterparts. Finally, we show
how to construct residual ﬂows, a ﬂow-based generative model that requires strict
Lipschitzness, using our orthogonal networks."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.0036900369003690036,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), whose deployment has witnessed extensive empirical success,
still exhibit a range of limitations that are not thoroughly studied. Firstly, deep convolutional networks
are in general difﬁcult to learn, and their high performance heavily relies on techniques that are not
fully understood, such as skip-connections (He et al., 2016a), batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy,
2015), specialized initialization (Glorot & Bengio, 2010). Secondly, they are notoriously sensitive
to imperceptible perturbations, including adversarial attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2014) or geometric
transformations (Azulay & Weiss, 2019). Finally, a precise characterization of their generalization
property is still under active investigation (Neyshabur et al., 2018; Jia et al., 2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.004920049200492005,"Orthogonal networks, which have a “ﬂat” spectrum with all singular values of the layer being 1 (each
layer’s output norm ∥y∥equals its input norm ∥x∥, ∀x), alleviate all problems above. As shown in
recent works, by enforcing orthogonality in neural nets, we obtain (1) easier optimization (Zhang
et al., 2018a; Qi et al., 2020): since each orthogonal layer preserves the gradient norm during
backpropagation, an orthogonal network is free from gradient vanishing/ exploding problems; (2)
robustness against adversarial perturbation (Anil et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019b; Trockman & Kolter,
2021): since each orthogonal layer is 1-Lipschitz, an orthogonal network can not amplify any
perturbation to the input to ﬂip the output prediction; (3) better generalizability as proved in (Jia et al.,
2019): a network’s generalization error is positively related to the standard deviation of each linear
layer’s singular values, thus encouraging orthogonality in the network lowers its generalization error."
INTRODUCTION,0.006150061500615006,"Despite the beneﬁts, enforcing orthogonality in convolutional networks is challenging. To avoid the
strict constraint, orthogonal initialization (dynamical isometry) (Pennington et al., 2017; Xiao et al.,
2018) and orthogonal regularization (Wang et al., 2019; Qi et al., 2020) are adopted to address the
gradient vanishing/exploding problems. However, these methods are not suitable for applications that"

et al., 2019), as they do not enforce strict orthogonality (and Lipschitzness) during training."
INTRODUCTION,0.00984009840098401,"Our goal is to enforce exact orthogonality in state-of-the-art convolutional networks without expensive
computations. We identify three main challenges in doing so. Challenge I: Achieving exact orthog-
onality throughout the training process. Prior works such as orthogonal regularization (Wang
et al., 2019) and reshaped kernel orthogonality (Jia et al., 2017; Cisse et al., 2017), while enjoying
algorithmic simplicity, do not meet the requirement of exact orthogonality. Note that enforcing
orthogonality during training is necessary as a post-training orthogonalization of the weights can
ruin the performance. Challenge II: Avoiding expensive computations. An efﬁcient algorithm is
crucial for scalability to large networks. Existing work based on projected gradient descent (Sedghi
et al., 2019), however, requires expensive projection after each update. For instance, the projection
step in Sedghi et al. (2019) computes an SVD and ﬂattens the spectrum to enforce orthogonality,
which costs O(size(feature) · channels3) for a convolutional layer. Challenge III: Scaling-up to
state-of-the-art deep convolutional networks. There are many variants to the standard convolu-
tional layer, including dilated, strided, group convolutions, which are essential for state-of-the-art
deep convolutional networks. However, none of the existing methods proposes mechanisms to
orthogonalize these variants. The lack of techniques, as a result, limits the broad applications of
orthogonal convolutional layers to state-of-the-art deeper convolutional networks."
INTRODUCTION,0.01107011070110701,"We resolve challenges I, II, and III by proposing complete parameterizations for orthogonal 1D-
convolutions and separable orthogonal 2D-convolutions. First, using the convolution theorem (Op-
penheim et al., 1996) (convolution in the spatial domain is equivalent to multiplication in the spectral
domain), we reduce the problem of designing orthogonal convolutions to constructing unitary ma-
trices for all frequencies, i.e., a paraunitary system (Vaidyanathan, 1993). Therefore, we obtain a
parameterization for all separable orthogonal 2D-convolutions, guaranteeing exact orthogonality and
high expressive power. Note that there is no previous approach that achieves exact orthogonality (up
to machine precision). For the ﬁrst time, our versatile framework enables the study in the designs of
deep orthogonal networks, such as skip connection, initialization, stride, and dilation. Consequently,
we scale orthogonal networks to deep architectures, including ResNet and ShufﬂeNet, substantially
outperforming their shallower counterparts. Our proposed method serves as gaining insight into the
trade-off between orthogonality and expressiveness. We observe that exact orthogonality is essential
in these deeper architectures with more than 10 layers (detailed discussion of exact orthogonality in
Appendix E.3). Finally, we show how to deploy our orthogonal networks in Residual Flow (Chen
et al., 2019), a ﬂow-based generative model that requires strict Lipschitzness (Appendix F)."
INTRODUCTION,0.012300123001230012,"Summary of Contributions:
1. We establish the equivalence between orthogonal convolutions in the spatial domain and paraunitary
systems in the spectral domain. Consequently, we can interpret existing approaches for orthogonal
convolutions as implicit designs of paraunitary systems.
2. Based on a complete factorization of 1D paraunitary systems, we propose the ﬁrst exact and
complete design for orthogonal 1D-convolutions as well as separable orthogonal 2D-convolutions,
ensuring exact orthogonality and high expressive power. None of the existing works achieve a
complete parameterization of all orthogonal 2D-convolutions.
3. We prove that orthogonality for various convolutional layers (strided, dilated, group) are also
entirely characterized by paraunitary systems. Consequently, our design easily extends to these
variants, ensuring both completeness and exactness of the orthogonal convolutions.
4. We study the design considerations for orthogonal networks (choices of skip connection, initializa-
tion, depth, width, and kernel size), and show that orthogonal networks can scale to deep architectures
including ResNet, WideResNet, and ShufﬂeNet."

feature resolution: a strided convolution (↓R-strided) decreases the resolution by down-sampling
after a standard convolution, while a transposed strided convolutional layer (↑R-strided) increases
the resolution by up-sampling before a standard convolution. (2) Dilated convolution increases the
receptive ﬁeld of a convolution without extra parameters: an R-dilated convolution up-samples its

the feasible set with unconstrained parameters), and projected gradient descent (PGD) / Riemannian
gradient descent (RGD). While regularization is approximate, the latter two learn exact orthog-
onality. (1) For orthogonal matrices, various regularizations are proposed in Xie et al. (2017);
Bansal et al. (2018). Alternatively, numerous parameterizations exist, including Householder reﬂec-
tions (Mhammedi et al., 2017), Given rotations (Dorobantu et al., 2016), Cayley transform (Helfrich

value clipping, and Vorontsov et al. (2017); Li et al. (2019a) consider RGD. (2) For orthogonal
convolutions, some existing works learn orthogonality for the ﬂattened matrix (Jia et al., 2017; Cisse
et al., 2017; Bansal et al., 2018) or each output channel (Liu et al., 2021). However, these methods
do not lead to orthogonality (norm preserving) of the operation. Sedghi et al. (2019) propose to
use PGD via singular value clipping and masking, which is expensive and can result in inexact
orthogonality. Recent works adopt parameterizations, using block convolutions (Li et al., 2019b),
Cayley transform (Trockman & Kolter, 2021), or convolution exponential (Singla & Feizi, 2021).
Note that network deconvolution (Ye et al., 2020) aims to whiten the activations (i.e., orthogonalize
their distribution), but the added whitening operations do not necessarily preserve orthogonality."

While the complete characterization of MD-paraunitary systems is known in theory (which incurs a

of kernel/dilation size and down-sampling types for the orthogonal convolutions. We ﬁnd that an
average pooling as down-sampling consistently outperforms strided convolutions. Furthermore, a
larger kernel size helps to boost the performance. (5) Run-time and memory comparison. We ﬁnd
that previously proposed orthogonal convolutions such as CayleyConv, BCOP, and RKO require
more GPU memory and computation time than SC-Fac. Therefore, we could not to scale them due
to memory constraints (for 22 and 32 layers using Tesla V100 32G). In order to scale up Lipschitz
networks, economical implementation of orthogonal convolution is crucial. As shown in Figure 4, for
deep and wide architectures, our SC-Fac is the most computationally and memory efﬁcient method
and the only method that scales to a width increase of 10 on WideResNet22. Missing numbers in
Figure 4 and Table 7 (Appendix E) are due to the large memory requirement."

to the orthogonal constraints, it is helpful to increase the depth/width of the network. However,
this signiﬁcantly increases the memory requirement; thus, a cheap implementation (like SC-Fac) is
desirable. Finally, we ﬁnd that a larger kernel size and down-sampling based on average pooling is

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.18450184501845018,"In this paper, we present a paraunitary framework for orthogonal convolutions. Speciﬁcally, we estab-
lish the equivalence between orthogonal convolutions in the spatial domain and paraunitary systems
in the spectral domain. Therefore, any design for orthogonal convolutions is implicitly constructing
paraunitary systems. We further show that the orthogonality for variants of convolution (strided,
dilated, and group convolutions) is also fully characterized by paraunitary systems. In summary,
paraunitary systems are all we need to ensure orthogonality for diverse types of convolutions."
CONCLUSION,0.1857318573185732,"Based on the complete factorization of 1D paraunitary systems, we develop the ﬁrst exact and
complete design of separable orthogonal 2D-convolutions. Our versatile design allows us to study
the design principles for orthogonal convolutional networks. Consequently, we scale orthogonal
networks to deeper architectures, substantially outperforming their shallower counterparts. In our
experiments, we observe that exact orthogonality plays a crucial role in learning deep Lipschitz
networks. In the future, we plan to investigate other use cases that exact orthogonality is essential."

ETHICS STATEMENT,0.1881918819188192,ETHICS STATEMENT
ETHICS STATEMENT,0.18942189421894218,"Our work lies in the foundational research on neural information processing. Speciﬁcally, we establish
the equivalence between orthogonal convolutions in neural networks and paraunitary systems in signal
processing. Furthermore, our presented orthogonal convolutional layers are plug-and-play modules
that can replace various convolutional layers in neural networks. Consequently, our modules are
applicable in Lipschitz networks for adversarial robustness, recurrent networks for learning long-term
dependency, or ﬂow-based networks for effortless reversibility."
ETHICS STATEMENT,0.1906519065190652,"The vulnerability of neural networks raises concerns about their deployment in security-sensitive
scenarios, such as healthcare systems or self-driving cars. In our experiment, we demonstrate a
successful application of orthogonal convolutions in learning robust networks. Furthermore, these
networks achieve higher robust accuracy without additional techniques such as adversarial training or
randomized smoothing. Therefore, our research contributes to the robust learning of neural networks
and potentially leads to their broader deployment."
ETHICS STATEMENT,0.1918819188191882,"Furthermore, we reduce the inference cost of our layer to be the same as a traditional convolution
layer, signiﬁcantly lowering the expense for deployment compared with other methods for orthogonal
networks. However, our layers are memory and computationally more expensive during training than
traditional layers. The overhead to the already expensive training cost exacerbates the concerns on
the efﬁcacy of learning neural networks. Therefore, balancing between robustness and efﬁciency
is an important research topic that requires more research in the future. We develop more efﬁcient
implementation than previous approaches, narrowing the gap between these two conﬂicting goals."

UNIFYING VARIOUS CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS IN THE SPECTRAL DOMAIN"

product Y (z) = H(z)X(z) in the spectral domain, and the layer is orthogonal if and only if H(z)
is paraunitary (Theorem B.5). However, the canonical convolution theorem does not hold for variants
of convolutions, thus enforcing a paraunitary H(z) may not lead to orthogonal convolution. In this
subsection, we address this limitation by showing that various convolutions can be uniformly written
as Y (z) = H(z)X(z), where Y (z), H(z), X(z) are some spectral representations of y, h, x.
Subsequently, we prove that any of these layers is orthogonal if and only if its H(z) is paraunitary."

Other architectures, including ShufﬂeNet and plain convolutional network (ConvNet), are further

ON THE NECESSITY OF EXACT ORTHOGONALITY"
LAYERS,0.9532595325953259,"Due to the beneﬁts like generalizability and robustness, achieving exact orthogonality in convolutions
is the primary goal of a current research line (Sedghi et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019b; Trockman & Kolter,
2021; Singla & Feizi, 2021). However, until our work, no previous approach achieves orthogonality
up to machine precision. Therefore, our proposed method serves as an extreme case in gaining insight
into the trade-off between orthogonality and expressiveness."
LAYERS,0.9544895448954489,"In Section 6, we have seen that exact orthogonality is not critical in shallow Lipschitz networks
for robustness, and various orthogonal convolutions (with different precision) achieve comparable
results. However, our method is more favorable in deeper networks (with more than 10 layers) — we
show the results in Table 7. It indicates that exact orthogonality is crucial in learning deep Lipschitz
networks. However, without our implementation of exact orthogonality (which does not exist before),
it is unclear whether exact orthogonality up to machine precision is needed in Lipschitz networks."
