ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.007462686567164179,"Time series forecasting is the process of using time series data to create a predic-
tion model. Long-short term memory (LSTM) models are the state-of-the-art for
time-series forecasting. However, LSTMs can handle limited length input mostly
since when the samples enter the model in sequence, the oldest samples need to
propagate through the LSTM cells self loop for each new sample and thus their
data diminishes in this process. This limits the length of the history that can be
used in the training for each time epoch. The common way of handling this prob-
lem is by partitioning time records to uniform intervals, averaging each interval,
and feeding the LSTM with rather short sequences, but each represents data from
a longer history.
In this paper, we show that this common data aggregation method is far from
optimal. We generalize the method of partitioning the data, and suggest an Ex-
ponential partitioning. We show that non-uniformly partitioning, and especially
Exponential partitioning improves LSTM accuracy, signiﬁcantly. Using other ag-
gregation functions (such as median or maximum) are shown to further improve
the accuracy. Overall, using 7 public datasets we show an improvement in accu-
racy by 6% to 27%."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.022388059701492536,"Predicting the future has always been a task humans found hard to accomplish. In the last decade,
many systems have surrounded themselves with multi-variate tracing, recording many variables
throughout time. Natural systems such as weather and rivers, ﬁnancial systems such as the stock
market and Bitcoin and global epidemics, all are recorded."
INTRODUCTION,0.029850746268656716,"This rise of big data allowed machine learning algorithms to predict the future with great accuracy.
The mentioned systems can be described using a single variable over time, namely univariate time
series, or several variables altogether as a multivariate time series. In both cases, one variable is
marked as the important one whom we’d like to predict."
INTRODUCTION,0.03731343283582089,"However, typically, machine learning models are not capable of handling long time series. As the
input intake to the model (more samples) grows wider, the model is required to adjust more internal
weights to learn the dependencies in the data. So while additional data appears to be always an
advantage, it affects learning speed but also learning accuracy."
INTRODUCTION,0.04477611940298507,"To overcome the trade-off between the will to accommodate as much data as possible and the en-
gineering limitation of the learning process it is common to aggregate the data at the model input.
Namely, a long data sequence is used, but the input to the model is kept small by partitioning the
data to equal size intervals and using the average of the samples in each interval (Li et al., 2017; Yu
et al., 2017; Petersen et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2020; Farhi et al., 2021). This enables to preserve
the model size modest while still looking far to the past."
INTRODUCTION,0.05223880597014925,"We observe here that this standard way of aggregation cannot be optimal since obviously the data
closer to the present (“newer”) is more important than older data, but it is still aggregated similarly.
Thus, we suggest an aggregation method that increases the aggregated interval length exponentially
as we look farther back in time. Additionally, we question the use of averaging as the best aggrega-
tion function."

point."
INTRODUCTION,0.07462686567164178,"In this paper, we study our Exponential partitioning and show using seven publicly available datasets
that indeed it performs much better than the uniform partitioning that is commonly practiced – an
improvement of 6.4-27% in the RMSE of the prediction. Interestingly, the best results were usually
achieved for slow Exponential grows where the exponent base is in the range [1.05, 1.1]."
INTRODUCTION,0.08208955223880597,"We also study other aggregation methods for the intervals (sample partitions) and found a more
complex picture. Median was the best aggregation function for most of the datasets, however average
was still the best for others, and in one case Maximum was the best aggregation function. We also
tested a combination of two functions but could only achieve minor improvements. The source-code
for our Exponential partitioning is available at http://www.github.com/TBD."

MOTIVATION"
MOTIVATION,0.09701492537313433,"To motivate our approach, consider the simplest case of estimating the future value of a number
series using a linear estimator, which is based only on two values of the series. To model this,
suppose the series is generated by some function and we can sample the function in the interval
[xs, xe] and want to predict the value at xp > xe."
MOTIVATION,0.1044776119402985,"Similarly to the practice in long time series entry to LSTM, instead of selecting the series (function)
value at two points in the interval, we can calculate the average of sub-intervals. Equation 1 and
Equation 2 show the calculated two points, as a function of k, a value within the interval (not
necessarily the middle of it)."
MOTIVATION,0.11194029850746269,"Equation 3 is the linear estimator and Equation 4 calculates the difference between the actual value
and the predicted value using a linear estimator. Figure 1 show the calculated differences for the
Sine (sin(15 · X)) and Log (log2 X) functions with the linear interpolation that were done with the
interval [1, 7] where k varies in the interval (1, 7) and the predicted value is at 8. The graphs clearly
show that the optimal partition is not in the middle of the interval and selecting a partition close
to the end of the interval is optimal. Similar results were obtained with a second order Lagrange
polynomial interpolation."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.208955223880597,"Different architectures implemented an ensemble model that tries to focus both on short term data
and long term, for better accuracy. Krstanovic & Paulheim (2018) constructed an ensemble of LSTM
models, each sub-model selected a different window size and other various parameters. Zhao et al.
(2020) also created a cluster of LSTMs that are constructed to separately forecast with different
time lag. NNCT weight integration strategy is introduced to determine the weight coefﬁcients of
the ensemble model. A more general method was proposed by Choi & Lee (2018) where an ensem-
ble of LSTM models with varying sequence length (accordingly to different datasets), this allows
the model to be capable of handling the dynamic different real-world time series. These methods,
although trying to combine between different intervals of time, indirectly try to solve the problem,
and do not create a single model that predicts accurately."
RELATED WORK,0.21641791044776118,"Changes to the sliding window algorithm were suggested by Laguna et al. (2011) who proposed a dy-
namic sliding window, where the size varies and changes according to the last selected window, and
after is processed by Dynamic Bayesian Network. It must be noted that this type of pre-processing
does not ﬁt LSTM models since the input data shape is not static. Other sliding window methods,
mostly for optimization purposes were suggested by Traub et al. (2019); Tangwongsan et al. (2017)."
RELATED WORK,0.22388059701492538,"Similar mechanisms from the ﬁeld of image vision have been imported into time-series analysis as
an attempt to handle temporal data with many features (such as images) (Donahue et al., 2015).
A single model, composed of CNN and LSTM, is used to handle a time-series input, where each
instance in time contains many features. In this type of model, time series data is pre-processed by
CNN to extract a ﬁxed meaningful vector of the input. We note that unlike this type of model which
deals with short window size and many features, this paper deals with long window size."

LSTM INPUT,0.2537313432835821,"The LSTM architecture accepts its data as a series of timestamps, each can be associated with many
features. The following process is employed to allow a time series to be given as input to LSTM.
For a single input, we select a window in time and consider the data in this window to predict value
of our predicted variable in a constant distance in the future, also called Prediction Horizon (PH).
For example, an 8-hour window can be used to predict value that is a 4 hours ahead of the end of
that window (Figure 2). We also note that the ﬁgure show a usage of one feature only, when many
features could be used in parallel."
LSTM INPUT,0.26119402985074625,"A relevant window size may contain hundreds of samples, and is too large for an LSTM. To lower
the input size, many papers suggest aggregating the windows into larger time interval, each is repre-
sented by the average value of all samples in the interval. For example, if the window size is 3 hours
and the interval size is 1 hour, a single input to the LSTM is 3 vectors each is an average of 1 hour.
The next input to the LSTM is generated by sliding the window by a certain time period, termed a
step (Figure 2). The prediction result can be either a regression, namely an attempt to predict the"

{3,4,5} is a partition into three subintervals and the number of samples in the three subintervals is
3, 4, and 5."

Thus, we suggest the Exponential partitioning where the bin size grows as we use data deeper in the
past. Formally Equation 6 deﬁnes the bin sizes of an exponential partitioning. This is done until the
penultimate bin, where the last bin holds the reminder of the window. Figure 3, shows an example
of partitioning process, where the window size is 6 records and a list of bins is {1, 2, 3}."

applicable. Partition number 0 is the common uniform partition (uniform baseline) and partition
number 1 is the case where the last n samples are taken as singletons and there is no aggregation
at all (simple baseline) – both are used as baselines on our experiments. Partition number 2 takes
the n −1 last samples as singletons and aggregates the rest in one bin. This partition is important
to understand whether the rest of the history is meaningful where compared to no aggregation (par-
tition number 1 ) We show in Section 5.2 the impact of aggregating the window size’s reminder is

SETUP,0.7238805970149254,"As we mentioned before, in many cases the difference between the top three partitions is rather
minimal. Thus, we tabulated in Figure 8 for each partition, the average increase of RMSE of all
datasets, compared to the smallest RMSE, in the speciﬁc dataset. Interestingly {1,1,1,1,1,1,1,41}
appears as one of the smallest RMSE, although it appears only twice in Table 3. The next top
performing partitions are exponential, {1,1,1,2,4,8,15,16} and {1,1,1,1,1,2,2,39}. Then there are
other skewed partitions, mostly exponential. The {4,4,4,4,4,4,4,20} partition appears once (we see
it in Table 3). It still places signiﬁcant weight (20) in the last bin, but it is not as skewed as the rest
of the good partitions. In general, by experimenting with a few top partitions, one can easily ﬁnd
one that is close to the best."
SETUP,0.7313432835820896,"It is already obvious that the partition {1,1,1,1,1,1,1,41} is performing rather well as can be seen in
Table 3 and Figure 8. This partition differ from the simple baseline in the last bin, where the en-
tire remaining history is aggregated. Figure 9 shows the performance improvement of the partition
{1,1,1,1,1,1,1,41} over {1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1}. Despite the fact that all the remaining 40 historical sam-
ples are aggregated and added to the single last bin the improvement is signiﬁcant for the majority
of the cases. In only four cases the improvement is negative, three of them are when the minimum
aggregation function is used, which was shown to be the worst function, by far."

SETUP,0.746268656716418,"All our results so far used a window size of 48 samples. As mentioned before, a larger window size
does not mean higher accuracy when using uniform partitioning. Figure 5.2 shows the RMSE for the
aggregation baseline partition and an exponential partitioning as a function of the window size for
solardataset. In this dataset, when the window size increases the RMSE of the aggregation baseline
increases as well, but on the other hand, when using exponential partitioning, RMSE continues to
decrease as the window size grows. Table 4 shows an example of the top 10 partitions for the
experiment for the solar and a window size of 96. Interestingly, small ε in the range [0.05,0.1]
performs best, smaller than for window size 48."

SETUP,0.7761194029850746,"To show that our results are not limited to LSTM, we trained other models, GRU, stacked LSTM,
RNN, LSTM Auto-encoder, GRU CNN, CNN and Bidirectional LSTM, on solar, with a window
size of 96 that is aggregated using 3 different partitions: Simple baseline (i.e., all elements are 1),
Uniform baseline (i.e., all elements are 8) and exponential Partitioning with ϵ = 0.09 and b = 4.
Figure 7 shows that all models, except RNN (which is not widely used anymore), achieve lower
RMSE using exponential Partitioning , compared to the baselines."

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.7910447761194029,"In this paper, we showed that the common way of aggregating long time series to feed LSTM net-
works, by partitioning the data to equal size intervals (uniform partition) and representing each
interval with the average value of the samples in it, is far from optimal. We suggested non-uniform
partitioning and the use of other aggregation functions to obtain signiﬁcant improvement in predic-
tion."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.7985074626865671,"Our ﬁnding show that while the best data partition depends on the dataset, there are a few partitions
that tend to perform best or close to best for all datasets. Thus, to obtain good prediction one needs
to experiment only with a few candidate partitions, that are based on exponential partitioning with
small ε values. In our experiment we found that almost every partitioning that use smaller bin
sizes for the near history and larger ones for the far history, and maintain a non-decreasing bin size
order is performing better than uniform partitioning. The cases where the uniform partitioning was
performing relatively well, occurred when the differences where very small. We believe that future
work should better understand how to select the best exponent for the partition."
