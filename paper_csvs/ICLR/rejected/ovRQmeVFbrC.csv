ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.004032258064516129,"Acquiring accurate labels on large-scale datasets is both time consuming and
expensive. To reduce the dependency of deep learning models on learning from
clean labeled data, several recent research efforts are focused on learning with
noisy labels. These methods typically fall into three design categories to learn
a noise robust model: sample selection approaches, noise robust loss functions,
or label correction methods. In this paper, we propose PARS: Pseudo-Label
Aware Robust Sample Selection, a hybrid approach that combines the best from
all three worlds in a joint-training framework to achieve robustness to noisy labels.
Speciﬁcally, PARS exploits all training samples using both the raw/noisy labels
and estimated/refurbished pseudo-labels via self-training, divides samples into
an ambiguous and a noisy subset via loss analysis, and designs label-dependent
noise-aware loss functions for both sets of ﬁltered labels. Results show that PARS
signiﬁcantly outperforms the state of the art on extensive studies on the noisy
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, particularly on challenging high-noise and
low-resource settings. In particular, PARS achieved an absolute 12% improvement
in test accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset with 90% symmetric label noise, and an
absolute 27% improvement in test accuracy when only 1/5 of the noisy labels are
available during training as an additional restriction. On a real-world noisy dataset,
Clothing1M, PARS achieves competitive results to the state of the art."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.012096774193548387,"Deep neural networks rely on large-scale training data with human annotated labels for achieving
good performance (Deng et al., 2009; Everingham et al., 2010). Collecting millions or billions
of labeled training data instances is very expensive, requires signiﬁcant human time and effort,
and can also compromise user privacy (Zheng et al., 2020; Bonawitz et al., 2017). Hence, there
has been a paradigm shift in the interests of the research community from large-scale supervised
learning (Krizhevsky et al., 2017; He et al., 2016a; Huang et al., 2017) to Learning with Noisy Labels
(LNL) (Natarajan et al., 2013; Goldberger & Ben-Reuven, 2016; Patrini et al., 2017; Tanno et al.,
2019) and/or unlabeled data (Berthelot et al., 2019b;a; Sohn et al., 2020). This is largely due to the
abundance of raw unlabeled data with weak user tags (Plummer et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2015) or
caption descriptions (Lin et al., 2014). However, it is not trivial to build models that are robust to
these noisy labels as the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with cross-entropy loss
can quickly overﬁt to the noise in the dataset, harming generalization (Zhang et al., 2016)."
INTRODUCTION,0.016129032258064516,"Most of the existing approaches on LNL can be divided into three main categories. First, several
noise robust loss functions (Ghosh et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019a; Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018) were
proposed that are inherently tolerant to label noise. Second, sample selection methods (also referred
to as loss correction in some literature) (Han et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2019; Arazo et al., 2019) are a
popular technique that analyzes the per-sample loss distribution and separates the clean and noisy
samples. The identiﬁed noisy samples are then re-weighted so that they contribute less in the loss
computation. A challenge in this direction is to design a reliable criterion for separation and hence
prevent overﬁtting to highly conﬁdent noisy samples, a behavior known as self-conﬁrmation bias.
Third, label correction methods attempt to correct the noisy labels using class-prototypes (Han et al.,
2019) or pseudo-labeling techniques (Tanaka et al., 2018; Yi & Wu, 2019). However, in order to
correct noisy labels, we typically need an extra (usually small) set of correctly labeled validation"

INTRODUCTION,0.024193548387096774,"labels. In particular, these methods can fail when the noise ratio is high and estimating correct labels
or high-quality pseudo-labels is non-trivial."
INTRODUCTION,0.028225806451612902,"More recently, the success of several state-of-the-art LNL methods is attributed to leveraging Semi-
Supervised Learning (SSL) based approaches (Li et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2019). Typically, a sample
selection technique is applied to separate clean and noisy labels in the training data, then the noisy
labels are deemed unreliable and hence treated as unlabeled in a SSL setting. Following the recent
SSL literature (Lee et al., 2013; Arazo et al., 2020), estimated pseudo-labels are usually used to
replace the ﬁltered noisy labels during training. These approaches have shown to be highly tolerant
to label-noise. However, the noisy labels are always discarded in favor of pseudo-labels in all the
existing literature, but they may still contain useful information for training. Pseudo-labeling is in
turn only applied to the ﬁltered noisy subset while the rest of the raw labels are typically used as is,
which makes it sensitive to the quality of the ﬁltering algorithm."
INTRODUCTION,0.03225806451612903,"In particular, motivated by a simple principle of making the most of the signal contained in the
noisy training data, we design PARS, short for Pseudo-Label Aware Robust Sample Selection. Our
contributions are as follows:"
INTRODUCTION,0.036290322580645164,"1. PARS proposes a novel, principled training framework for LNL. It trains on both the original
labels and pseudo-labels. Unlike previous works, instead of ﬁltering and then discarding
the low-conﬁdent noisy labels, PARS uses the entire set of original labels, and applies
self-training with pseudo-labeling and data augmentation for the entire dataset (rather than
the ﬁltered noisy data only)."
PARS IS ABLE TO LEARN USEFUL INFORMATION FROM ALL THE AVAILABLE DATA SAMPLES THROUGH,0.04032258064516129,"2. PARS is able to learn useful information from all the available data samples through
label-dependent noise-aware loss functions. Speciﬁcally, in order to prevent overﬁtting to
inaccurate original labels (or inaccurate pseudo-labels), PARS performs a simple conﬁdence-
based ﬁltering technique by setting a high threshold on their predicted conﬁdence, and
applies robust/negative learning (or positive/negative learning) accordingly."
PARS IS ABLE TO LEARN USEFUL INFORMATION FROM ALL THE AVAILABLE DATA SAMPLES THROUGH,0.04435483870967742,"3. We perform extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets i.e. noisy CIFAR-10,
noisy CIFAR-100 and Clothing1M. Results demonstrate that PARS outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods by a signiﬁcant margin, in particular when high level of noise
is present in the training data. We also conduct sufﬁcient ablation studies to validate the
importance of our contributions."
WE DESIGN A NOVEL LOW-RESOURCE SEMI-SUPERVISED LNL SETTING WHERE ONLY A SMALL SUBSET,0.04838709677419355,"4. We design a novel low-resource semi-supervised LNL setting where only a small subset
of data is weakly labeled (Section 4.3). We show signiﬁcant gains over state-of-the-art
approaches using PARS. This setting is particularly interesting when it is hard to obtain
large-scale noisy labeled data. In particular, we ﬁnd that surprisingly none of the existing
LNL methods outperform a baseline SSL model (FixMatch) (Sohn et al., 2020) that is
not even designed to handle label noise, and yet PARS can achieve up to an absolute 27%
improvement in test accuracy in a controlled high-noise low-resource setting."

RELATED WORK,0.06048387096774194,"Noise robust loss function based methods propose objective functions that are tolerant to label noise.
A commonly used loss function that is identiﬁed to be robust to noisy labels is Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) (Ghosh et al., 2017). Wang et al. (2019a) proposed Improved MAE which is a re-weighted
version of MAE. Zhang & Sabuncu (2018) proposed Generalized Cross Entropy Loss (GCE) which
is a generalization of MAE and Categorical Cross Entropy loss. More recently, Wang et al. (2019b)
designed a Symmetric Cross Entropy (SCE) loss which is similar in spirit to the symmetric KL-
divergence and combines the cross-entropy loss with the reverse cross-entropy. Although SCE is
robust to noisy labels, Ma et al. (2020) proposed a normalized family of loss functions which are
shown to be more robust than SCE for extreme levels of label noise. Kim et al. (2019) and Kim et al.
(2021) designed a framework that alternates between positive learning on accurate/clean labels and
negative learning on complementary/wrong labels. Loss correction approaches explicitly modify the
loss function during training to take into account the noise distribution by modeling a noise transition"

RELATED WORK,0.07258064516129033,"Another family of methods focus primarily on sample selection, where the model selects small-loss
samples as “clean” samples under the assumption that the model ﬁrst ﬁts to the clean samples before
memorizing the noisy samples (also known as the early-learning assumption) (Arpit et al., 2017;
Zhang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2020). Han et al. (2018) and Yu et al. (2019) proposed Co-teaching
where sample selection is conducted using two networks to select clean and noisy samples, and then
the clean samples are used for further training. MentorNet (Jiang et al., 2018) is a student-teacher
framework where a pre-trained teacher network guides the learning of the student network with clean
samples (whose labels are deemed “correct”). In the decoupling training strategy proposed by Malach
& Shalev-Shwartz (2017), two networks are trained simultaneously and guide each other on when and
how to update. One limitation of these approaches is that they ignore all the noisy/unclean samples
during training and only leverage the expected-to-be clean samples for improving performance. Li
et al. (2020) proposed DivideMix where sample selection is conducted based on per-sample loss
distribution, and then the noisy samples are treated as unlabeled data in a SSL setting (Berthelot et al.,
2019b). Nishi et al. (2021) further investigated the potential of using augmentation strategies in LNL,
one used for loss analysis and another for learning, thus improving generalization of DivideMix."
RELATED WORK,0.07661290322580645,"Compared to the above, label correction aims to improve the quality of the noisy labels by explicitly
correcting the wrong labels. Tanaka et al. (2018) and Yi & Wu (2019) predicted the correct labels
either as estimates of label probabilities (soft labels) or as one-hot class labels (hard labels). Arazo
et al. (2019) combined label correction with iterative sample selection by ﬁrst ﬁltering clean labels
from noisy labels modeling a two-component Beta Mixture, and then estimating to correct labels for
those noisy samples. Tanaka et al. (2018) combined label correction with additional regularization
terms that were proved to be helpful for LNL. Song et al. (2019) also used label replacement to
refurbish a subset of labels, thereby gradually increasing the number of available training samples.
Liu et al. (2020) computed soft labels as model predictions and then exploit it to avoid memorization."

Figure 1 (and Algorithm 1 in Appendix A.2), and each component is discussed in detail below.
In particular, there are three major differences between PARS and previous works: 1) PARS does
not treat the high-conﬁdence samples as ""clean"", but rather applies robust loss functions to address
the relatively low yet non-negligible level of noise. 2) PARS does not discard the noisy (or low-
conﬁdence) labels, but rather applies a negative learning framework to learn the “complement” of
these labels (Kim et al., 2019). This constitutes one major difference between the selective negative
learning procedure of Kim et al. (2019) and PARS, that Kim et al. (2019) only apply it during the
warm-up stage and still choose to discard the ﬁltered noisy labels in favour of pseudo-labels in a
SSL manner, and we unify the two stages and show improved performance. 3) We improve the

(Krizhevsky et al., 2009) with synthetic label noise. The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets each
contain 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images of size 32×32 pixels with 10 and 100 classes
respectively. Both of these datasets have clean label annotations, hence we inject synthetic noise to
train the models, and test the performance using the original clean labels. Following previous work
(Arazo et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020), we evaluate with two types of noise: symmetric (uniform) and
asymmetric (class-conditional). For symmetric noise, the labels are generated by ﬂipping the labels
of a certain percentage of training samples to any other class labels uniformly. We use noise ratios of
{0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9} which are the symmetric noise probabilities as deﬁned in (Patrini et al., 2017; Li
et al., 2020). While for asymmetric noise labels, ﬂipping of labels only happens for a certain set of
classes (Patrini et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020) such as truck →automobile, bird →airplane, deer →
horse, and cat↔dog. For asymmetric noise, we use the noise rate of 40%."

to all the existing methods, PARS consistently outperforms on CIFAR-10 dataset with different
types and levels of label noise. Speciﬁcally, we observe an increase over the best reported results by
Liu et al. (2020) by approx 14.9% and by approx 1.7% on Nishi et al. (2021) for 90% symmetric
label noise, which shows the robustness of our method to high levels of label noise. On a more
challenging setting of CIFAR-100 dataset, we improve over the state-of-the-art work of Nishi et al.
(2021) by an absolute 12% improvement in test accuracy in the presence of 90% symmetric label
noise. Notably, compared to training with a robust loss function alone (i.e.performing warm-up
training thoroughly), PARS is able to achieve up to 40% absolute improvement in test accuracy.
These experimental results strongly advocate for PARS, particularly the proposed training framework
of using label-dependent noise-aware loss functions on the ambiguous/noisy original raw labels (and
corrected/noisy pseudo-labels) with robust/negative learning (and positive/negative self-learning)."

proposed by Nishi et al. (2021), DM-AugDesc-WS-SAW, seemed to obtain the best performance
overall due to the use of strong augmentation in a warm-up training phase. It is important to note that
both methods from Nishi et al. (2021) are based on DivideMix (Li et al., 2020), whereas PARS is a
stand-alone novel training procedure which is able to achieve signiﬁcant improvements. This paves
way to designing other methods for advancing the state of the art in LNL. We will leave to future

motivated by the semi-supervised literature, where the entire training set is ﬁltered into clean and

manner. For fair comparison, we also extend these two methods by combining the unlabeled data with
the ﬁltered noisy data in their semi-supervised training framework, and term them as “DivideMix+”

baselines in all datasets and noise settings by a margin, and achieves an absolute improvement of up

ABLATION STUDY"
ABLATION STUDY,0.5685483870967742,"Table 4 analyzes the results of different components in PARS and how each learning stage contributes
to the ﬁnal model performance. First, we empirically test the performance of the “warm-up training
only” stage (without the sample selection or losses on either the original or pseudo labels). This is
empirically equivalent to replacing the standard cross-entropy loss LCE by a noise robust loss LRL
and optimizing Equation (5) thoroughly. With such a noise robust loss function, we achieve good
performance compared to using cross-entropy, especially in the presence of high levels of label noise.
However, the warmed-up model performs far worse than the “full model” of PARS, emphasizing
the importance of robust sample selection and using label-dependent noise-aware losses on both the
original and pseudo labels as we have proposed."
ABLATION STUDY,0.5725806451612904,"Next, we investigate the importance of different components in PARS. 1) Self-training with pseudo-
labels is an important part of PARS. Compared to the full model, removing the use of pseudo-labels
entirely (i.e.“PARS w/o Lpseudo”) leads to a signiﬁcant reduction in model performance. This implies
that adding the self-training losses to PARS is critical to improve the model convergence after the
robust warm-up training. 2) Motivated by the fact that there is exploitable signal contained in the
ﬁltered noisy set after robust sample selection, we include information from all the original and
pseudo labels to enhance performance of PARS. We design a training procedure where we discard
the ﬁltered noisy labels and ignore the negative learning losses on both the original and pseudo labels
(i.e.“PARS w/o LNL in either Lraw or Lpseudo”). Overall, there is a consistent reduction in model
performance across all noise types and levels as compared to the full model. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst evidence in literature that the ﬁltered noisy labels by a sample selection
strategy can be effectively included (rather than discarded) in order to consistently boost the model
performance in LNL."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5806451612903226,"In this paper, we proposed a novel method for training with noisy labels called PARS: Pseudo-
Label Aware Robust Sample Selection, which takes advantage of self-training with pseudo-labels
and data augmentation, and exploits original and pseudo labels with label-dependent noise-aware
loss functions with help of robust sample selection. We conduct several experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets to empirically evaluate the strengths of our proposed method in learning with
noisy labels. In particular, PARS gains signiﬁcant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods in
challenging situations such as when high levels of noise are present. Furthermore, we also evaluate
our method under a novel low-resource/semi-supervised learning with noisy labels setting, where
only a subset of noisy labels are available during training, and PARS outperforms the baseline models
by a signiﬁcant margin. We believe this is a ubiquitous setting in the real world when it may be
difﬁcult to obtain large-scale weak labels potentially due to data privacy concerns. In the future,
we are interested in exploring further this semi-supervised learning setting with noisy labels, and
extending our model to other domains such as audio and NLP."

represent the true label distribution (due to noisy labels) the RCE loss term minimizes the entropy
between the true and predicted distribution, p(x; θ), as this can reﬂect the true distribution to some
extent. As argued by Ma et al. (2020), SCE loss is only partially robust to noisy labels and they
introduce a normalized version of traditional loss functions for classiﬁcation, e.g. Cross-Entropy
(CE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Focal Loss (FL) and Reverse Cross Entropy (RCE)."

RCE, Normalized RCE) minimize the probability at atleast one other class position. Combining the
passive loss with the normalized active loss such as normalized cross entropy loss helps to deal with
the denominator increasing signiﬁcantly in eq. (13). Hence, Active Passive Loss (APL) can leverage

decay 5e-4 and batch size of 128. The models are trained for 100 epochs. For the learning rate
schedule, we use a cosine learning rate decay (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2016) which changes the learning
rate to ηcos( 7πt"
REFERENCES,0.9354838709677419,"16T ) where η is the initial learning rate, t is the current training step and T are the total
number of training steps. The initial learning is set to 0.03, λS to 1.0, λN to 0.1, λR to 1.0, and the
conﬁdence threshold τ for sample selection is set to 0.95 unless stated otherwise. For the robust
warm-up training, we train with the combination of Normalized Cross Entropy (LNCE) and Mean
Absolute Error (LMAE). The weights for the NCE and MAE are 1.0 for CIFAR-10, and 10.0 and
1.0 respectively for CIFAR-100. The warm-up for CIFAR-10 is done for 25 epochs if the noise ratio
is below 0.6, and 40 epochs if the noise ratio is above 0.6. For CIFAR-100, the warm-up is done
for 50 epochs. For all experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, we sample data with
three times the original batch size for the self-training loss. The conﬁdence based thresholding (τ -
0.95) is also performed on this pseudo-labeled batch of data samples for the positive and negative
learning. We apply Exponential Moving Average to the model parameters with decay of 0.999. We
leverage RandAugment (Cubuk et al., 2020) for strong augmentations on the data samples, and
keep the number of augmentations ﬁxed to 2 for fair comparison. All our models are trained using
the PyTorch framework (Paszke et al., 2019). The code will be made publicly available for future
research purposes."

10 epochs with the Symmetric Cross Entropy loss (LSCE) with the same hyper-parameter settings as
proposed in the paper (Wang et al., 2019b). The initial learning rate is set to 0.002, and decayed by a
