ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0029940119760479044,"We are concerned with the problem of distributional prediction with incomplete
features: The goal is to estimate the distribution of target variables given feature
vectors with some of the elements missing. A typical approach to this problem
is to perform missing-value imputation and regression, simultaneously or sequen-
tially, which we call the generative approach. Another approach is to perform
regression after appropriately encoding missing values into the feature, which we
call the discriminative approach. In comparison, the generative approach is more
robust to the feature corruption while the discriminative approach is more favor-
able to maximize the performance of prediction. In this study, we propose a hybrid
method to take the best of both worlds. Our method utilizes the black-box varia-
tional inference framework so that it can be applied to a wide variety of modern
machine learning models, including the variational autoencoders. We also con-
ﬁrmed the effectiveness of the proposed method empirically."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.008982035928143712,"We address the problem of prediction with incomplete data, which often arises in real-life data due
to the lack of data collecting resources and/or privacy concerns. For example, consider analyzing
electronic health records. The input variables of the prediction are patients’ demographic charac-
teristics and history of medical measurement data obtained with various instruments and the target
variable is the survival time of patients. Thus, some of these features are not available depending
on patients due to, e.g., non-standardized medical equipment, legal regulation and privacy concerns.
More formally, each input is an incomplete set of features represented with a tuple u = (˜x, m) such
that ˜x ∈Rdx is the corrupted version of the complete input x ∈Rdx and m ∈{0, 1}dx indicates the
missing entries of ˜x: For all j ∈[dx], mj = 1 if and only if the j-th feature is missing. In particular,
missing entries are ﬁlled with zero and non-missing entries are identical to the one in the complete
input, ˜xj = (1−mj)xj. Given the incomplete features u, we want to predict the outcome y ∈Rdy,
which is modeled with a predictive distribution y ∼p(y|u, θ). Here, the parameter θ is unknown
and should be learned from data."
INTRODUCTION,0.011976047904191617,"One straightforward way to deal with such incompletion is to incorporate generative models: The
missing values in ˜x are imputed with some generative model and the target y is predicted based on
the result of the imputation. Sometimes the imputation is done implicitly or simultaneously with the
prediction. An advantage of this method lies in that the meaning of m is inherently incorporated.
Without such context, algorithms must learn by themselves that m is actually indicating missingness
(if that is relevant to the prediction task), which incurs extra generalization errors. In other words,
appropriate generative models make the prediction robust to the feature incompletion."
INTRODUCTION,0.014970059880239521,"On the other hand, the discriminative models that directly learn the conditional density pθ(y|u)
sometimes exhibit superior performance (Kuhn et al., 2013) due to their alignment in terms of the ob-
jective. This is especially the case when the feature incompletion is not a dominant factor (Lasserre
et al., 2006). However, it is not as straightforward as generative models to incorporate the context
of missingness into discriminative models and therefore their prediction may be less robust to the
feature incompletion."

INTRODUCTION,0.020958083832335328,"To best of our knowledge, there have been no general solution to this dilemma of the generative
and the discriminative approaches, i.e., generic method of discriminative inference with incomplete
features for generative models, which we abbreviate as DIG. In particular, although there have been
similar efforts made in the literature, the previous methods are limited in terms of the applicable
models. For example, several DIG methods have been proposed for exponential families (Ghahra-
mani & Jordan, 1994; Smola et al., 2005) and Gaussian processes (Pacheco et al., 2014), but they
cannot handle modern machine-learning architectures such as deep neural networks."
INTRODUCTION,0.023952095808383235,"This motivates us to seek for general and widely applicable frameworks that solve the dilemma. To
this end, we propose a new variational approximation and a new variance reduction technique, which
enable us to perform DIG within the black-box variational inference (VI) framework (Jordan et al.,
1999; Zhang et al., 2018). We have also empirically conﬁrmed the effectiveness of the proposed
method through numerical experiments, employing the variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma
& Welling, 2013) as the base generative model."
INTRODUCTION,0.02694610778443114,"The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the mathematical notation
and the technical challenges in DIG with ﬂexible models. Then, in Section 3, we present our method
adopting VI in the DIG setting. In Section 4, we show the experimental results that conﬁrm the
effectiveness of the proposed method. In Section 5, we review and discuss the related work. Finally,
in Section 6, we conclude the paper with some remarks and future perspectives. All the proofs for
theoretical statements are given in the appendix."

To maximize Equation 3 with LVM, we have to evaluate

the objective, this can be approximately done with the variational inference (VI) framework (Jordan
et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2018) in favor of ﬂexibility and scalability. However, with DIG, we also
have a negative log integral, i.e., −Lu(θ). The optimization of such objective is relatively difﬁcult
since there have been no equivalent of VI in terms of the ﬂexibility and scalability (see Section 5)."

EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS"
EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS,0.37425149700598803,"We employ three subject algorithms and two baselines in the experiment. The main subjects are all
based on VAE (Kingma & Welling, 2013), a typical example of LVM, whose basic architectures are
identical to each other: See the appendix (Section D) for more details."
EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS,0.3772455089820359,"Generative method: VAE, VAE*.
As an example of generative approach, we employ VAE and
solve missing-value imputation and regression simultaneously by regarding the target as a part of
the feature, x′ ←x ⊕y, and reconstructing x′ from its corrupted version, where the entries cor-
responding to y is considered as missing. In particular, we adopt the formulation of Collier et al.
(2020), which comes with two variants for different missing-value processes, namely missing not
at random (MNAR) and missing completely at random (MCAR). The difference between MNAR
and MCAR is only in the generative model (i.e., the architecture of the decoder), represented by
Equation 6 and Equation 5, respectively. We denote these variants as VAE and VAE*, respectively."
EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS,0.38023952095808383,"To train it to be able to reconstruct y, we double the training dataset with masking (and not masking)
the target y. Note that the objective function is not exactly aligned with the prediction task because
of the imputation-based formulation."
EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS,0.38323353293413176,"Discriminative method: CVAE.
As an example of discriminative approach, we employ the con-
ditional VAE (CVAE) proposed by Kingma et al. (2014); Sohn et al. (2015). In our setting, the
conditional variables consist of the corrupted feature ˜x and the missingness indicator m. In prac-
tice, these vectors are concatenated before fed into neural networks. The generative model of CVAE
in this setting is given by p(y|u, θ) :=
R
p(y, z|u, θ) dz, while the decoder represents the density
in the integral and the encoder is used to approximate the posterior p(z|y, u, θ). Note that the re-
sulting model is not informed with the context of m as VAE and VAE* are,3 but the objective is (a
variational approximation of) the conditional evidence, which is aligned with the prediction task."
EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS,0.38622754491017963,"Proposed method: DVAE, DVAE*.
We call the instantiation of vDIG on VAE as the discrimina-
tive VAE (DVAE). We implement MNAR (Equation 6) and MCAR (Equation 5) variants of DVAE
as with VAE, respectively denoted by DVAE and DVAE*. The difference with VAE and its variant
is that we have additional encoders corresponding to ψ and ξ, while the decoder θ and the encoder
φ are common. See Section D for more details. We choose α = 2 for the parameter of the R´enyi
divergence."
EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS,0.38922155688622756,"Baseline methods: Simple, MICE.
As the ﬁrst baseline method, we employ a simple fully-
connected feed-forward neural network (FCFNN) with the same architecture with the encoders of
the above methods, except its output is considered as a distribution of the target y instead of z.
Although the output distribution is restricted to a Gaussian, it requires no variational approximation
and hence the conditional likelihood ln pθ(y|u) is exactly maximized. We call this Simple. The
second baseline is the method of the multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) (Azur et al.,
2011), which is a classic approach in statistics to deal with missing values. In particular, we em-
ploy the Bayesian ridge regression for the missing-value imputation task and the FCFNN of the ﬁrst
baseline for the subsequent regression task."

EFFECT OF NEW VARIATIONAL APPROXIMATION,0.44011976047904194,"Procedure.
We compare the stability of optimization of DVAE with three different variational
approximation, namely, ELBO+CUBO, ELBO+EUBO and ELBO+EUBO+SP. In all cases, the
Monte-Carlo approximation of ELBO is used to compute the joint evidence Ly,u(θ). The marginal
evidence Lu(θ) is computed with the Monte-Carlo approximation for both CUBO (albeit biased)
and EUBO. Only ELBO+EUBO+SP employs the surrogate parametrization."
EFFECT OF NEW VARIATIONAL APPROXIMATION,0.4431137724550898,"Result.
Figure 1 shows the training processes of DVAE with the AQ-CO dataset from UCI Ma-
chine Learning Repository (see the appendix). It is seen that ELBO+EUBO+SP is most stable in
the optimization. Also note that the objective of ELBO+CUBO may be negatively biased (recall the
logarithm wrapping the expectation in Equation 10), but we cannot know how much."

We apply seven different algorithms in Section 4.1 to six different regression tasks

entries of feature completely at random with probability p = 0.1. In each conﬁguration, we iterate
the same procedure with ﬁve different random seed values."
PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE,0.45209580838323354,"Result.
Table 1 shows the cross entropy, i.e., −ln pθ(y|u), averaged over the test splits. Overall,
both DVAE and DVAE* almost always perform best or at least comparable to the best scores within
one standard deviation, indicating the effectiveness the DIG method applied VAE. In particular, it
is more clear that they outperform the others when averaged over all the datasets (‘Total’ column).
Moreover, DVAE* is slightly better than DVAE as expected because the way we drop the feature
entries is MCAR."

The difference is visualized in Figure 2. The most robust algorithms are VAE and VAE*,
while DVAE* and DVAE are the second and the third most robust algorithms. This matches our
expectation because both VAE and VAE* are informed with the context of m and implicitly regu-
larized through missing-value imputation task. Similarly, DVAE and DVAE* are also informed with
the meaning of m, but they are not subject to the implicit regularization. In particular, DVAE* is
more robust than DVAE as the MCAR model is accurate (in this setting) and more informative than
the MNAR model."

We also discuss the relationship with the existing studies on missing data handling in the appendix."
RELATED WORK,0.4820359281437126,"The χ-variational upper bound (CUBO) (Dieng et al., 2017) has been proposed to estimate such
upper bounds, utilizing the α-R´enyi divergence (equivalently, χ-divergence). However, as Pradier
et al. (2019) pointed out, the resulting estimate of CUBO is biased and in some cases numerically
unstable4. This phenomenon has been also conﬁrmed in our experiment (Section 4.2.1). Another
upper bound has been proposed by (Ji & Shen, 2019) with the reverse KL divergence instead of
the R´enyi divergence, but it is also biased and not guaranteed to be an upper bound. We also ﬁnd
that the parsimonious upper bound (Mattei & Frellsen, 2018) is suitable in terms of the upper-bound
guarantee, while it induces a min-max form during the upper bound minimization procedure, which
implies the convergence property of the algorithm could be tricky."
RELATED WORK,0.48502994011976047,"The proposed upper bound, EUBO, is closely related to the one studied by Kuleshov & Ermon
(2017), which is designed for estimating partition functions. Although their method also suffers
from high variance, they took different approach to reduce it. In particular, they adaptively reduced
the learning rate of the variational parameter ψ. However, as the authors noted, this does not solve
the problem enough for scaling to large datasets."

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON RELATED WORK: MISSING-DATA
HANDLING"
"N
PN",0.8682634730538922,"Arguably the most classic approach to the missing value problem is the two-step approach, also
known as the imputation method (Enders, 2010). This category includes traditional listwise or pair-
wise deletion methods, single imputation methods and multiple imputation methods. The key fea-
ture of this approach is that one processes the incomplete features to get estimates of complete ones
ˆx ≈x in the ﬁrst step and then performs prediction based on ˆx. The score-based methods (Jaakkola
& Haussler, 1999; Holub et al., 2005; Perina et al., 2009; ´Smieja et al., 2018) can be considered
as a generalization of the two-step approach developed in the machine learning literature. With a
score-based method, one ﬁrst learns the generative distribution pθ(x), which is used to extract some
information called score, s. The score is then fed to predictive models pθ(y|s). Several drawbacks
stem from the two-step nature of these methods. In case of the imputation method, the predictor
loses the information whether each element of ˆx is original or imputed. This makes it difﬁcult to
estimate the uncertainty resulted from the feature corruption. Moreover, even though the uncertainty"

where the joint complete-data distribution pθ(y, x) is explicitly modeled and marginalized over the
corrupted elements of features to obtain the objective ln pθ(y, u). This approach may suffer from
unnecessarily performance degradation as in the score-based approach, since the objective contains
the generative term of u, ln pθ(y, u) = ln pθ(y|u) + ln pθ(u)."

PN",0.8892215568862275,"The third approach is the discriminative approach. Speciﬁcally, tree-based models such as gradient
boosting trees are able to naturally handle incomplete features (Twala et al., 2008). Moreover, it is
also recommended in (Kuhn et al., 2013) to encode missingness as a distinct feature, i.e., treat the
concatenation of the corrupted feature and the mask vectors, ˜x ⊕m, as the input to the predictive
models. The advantage of this approach is that the resulting objective function is coherent with
the goal of predictive risk minimization, i.e., there is no generative term unlike in the two-step and
generative approach. However, there is no trivial way to inform the model that m actually indicates
missing features. Therefore it may take extra samples to learn the meaning of m by itself."
"N
PN",0.8922155688622755,"Finally, the DIG approach can be thought of as a hybrid of the generative and discriminative ap-
proaches. With DIG, the data is modeled with joint distribution pθ(y, u), but the learning objective
is the conditional evidence ln pθ(y|u), which is computed from Bayes’ rule. Therefore, it naturally
incorporates the information of missingness and is directly trained to maximize the predictive perfor-
mance. The ﬁrst application of the DIG strategy in the context of incomplete feature is Ghahramani
& Jordan (1994), which was followed by Smola et al. (2005) with a kernel-based generalization.
It is crucial in their results that the complete-data model pθ(y, x) is a exponential family so that
the objective function is optimized with the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). A tractable
approximation algorithm for the case of Gaussian processes is derived by Pacheco et al. (2014)
with the combination of the variational inference (Jordan et al., 1999) and the expectation propaga-
tion (Minka, 2001) framework. As opposed to their method, our focus is on black-box variational
inference algorithm applicable to a variety of models."
