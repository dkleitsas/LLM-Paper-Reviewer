ABSTRACT,0.0029498525073746312,"In the deep learning era, long video generation of high-quality still remains chal-
lenging due to the spatio-temporal complexity and continuity of videos. Existing
prior works have attempted to model video distribution by representing videos as
3D grids of RGB values, which impedes the scale of generated videos and neglects
continuous dynamics. In this paper, we found that the recent emerging paradigm
of implicit neural representations (INRs) that encodes a continuous signal into a
parameterized neural network effectively mitigates the issue. By utilizing INRs of
video, we propose dynamics-aware implicit generative adversarial network (DI-
GAN), a novel generative adversarial network for video generation. Specifically,
we introduce (a) an INR-based video generator that improves the motion dynam-
ics by manipulating the space and time coordinates differently and (b) a motion
discriminator that efficiently identifies the unnatural motions without observing
the entire long frame sequences. We demonstrate the superiority of DIGAN un-
der various datasets, along with multiple intriguing properties, e.g., long video
synthesis, video extrapolation, and non-autoregressive video generation. For ex-
ample, DIGAN improves the previous state-of-the-art FVD score on UCF-101 by
30.7% and can be trained on 128 frame videos of 128×128 resolution, 80 frames
longer than the 48 frames of the previous state-of-the-art method.1*"

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.008849557522123894,"Deep generative models have successfully synthesized realistic samples on various domains, includ-
ing image (Brock et al., 2019; Karras et al., 2020b; 2021; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021), text (Adi-
wardana et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020), and audio (Dhariwal et al., 2020; Lakhotia et al., 2021).
Recently, video generation has emerged as the next challenge of deep generative models, and thus
a long line of work has been proposed to learn the video distribution (Vondrick et al., 2016; Kalch-
brenner et al., 2017; Saito et al., 2017; 2020; Tulyakov et al., 2018; Acharya et al., 2018; Clark et al.,

INTRODUCTION,0.011799410029498525,"Despite their significant efforts, a substantial gap still exists from large-scale real-world videos. The
difficulty of video generation mainly stems from the complexity of video signals; they are continu-
ously correlated across spatio-temporal directions. Specifically, most prior works interpret the video
as a 3D grid of RGB values, i.e., a sequence of 2D images, and model them with discrete decoders
such as convolutional (Tian et al., 2021) or autoregressive (Yan et al., 2021) networks. However,
such discrete modeling limits the scalability of generated videos due to the cubic complexity (Saito
et al., 2020) and ignores the inherent continuous temporal dynamics (Gordon & Parde, 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.014749262536873156,"Meanwhile, implicit neural representations (INRs; Sitzmann et al. (2020); Tancik et al. (2020)) have
emerged as a new paradigm for representing continuous signals. INR encodes a signal into a neural
network that maps input coordinates to corresponding signal values, e.g., 2D coordinates of im-
ages to RGB values. Consequently, INR amortizes the signal values of arbitrary coordinates into a
compact neural representation instead of discrete grid-wise signal values, requiring a large memory"

and Anokhin et al. (2021) exposed that INR-based image generative adversarial networks (GANs;
Goodfellow et al. (2014)), which generate images as INRs, show impressive generation performance.
Interestingly, they further merit various advantages of INRs, e.g., natural inter- and extra-polation,
anycost inference (i.e., control the trade-off of quality and cost), and parallel computation, which
needs a non-trivial modification to apply under other generative model architectures."
INTRODUCTION,0.035398230088495575,"Inspired by this, we aim to design an INR-based (or implicit) video generation model by interpret-
ing videos as continuous signals. This alternative view is surprisingly effective as INRs compactly
encode the videos without 3D grids and naturally model the continuous spatio-temporal dynamics.

separately manipulating space and time significantly improves the video generation."
INTRODUCTION,0.038348082595870206,"Contribution. We introduce dynamics-aware implicit generative adversarial network (DIGAN), a
novel INR-based GAN architecture for video generation. Our idea is two-fold (see Figure 2):"
INTRODUCTION,0.04129793510324484,"• Generator: We propose an INR-based video generator that decomposes the motion and content
(image) features, and incorporates the temporal dynamics into the motion features.2 To be spe-
cific, our generator encourages the temporal coherency of videos by regulating the variations of
motion features with a smaller temporal frequency and enhancing the expressive power of mo-
tions with an extra non-linear mapping. Moreover, our generator can create videos with diverse
motions sharing the initial frame by conditioning a random motion vector to the content vector.
• Discriminator: We propose a motion discriminator that efficiently detects unnatural motions
from a pair of images (and their time difference) instead of a long sequence of images. Specif-
ically, DIGAN utilizes a 2D convolutional network for the motion discriminator, unlike prior
works that utilize computationally heavier 3D convolutional networks to handle the entire video
at once. Such an efficient discriminating scheme is possible since INRs of videos can non-
autoregressively synthesize highly correlated frames at arbitrary times."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.06489675516224189,"Image generation. Image generation has achieved remarkable progress, with the advance of various
techniques, including generative adversarial networks (GANs; Goodfellow et al. (2014)), autoregres-
sive models (Ramesh et al., 2021), and diffusion models (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021). In particular,
GANs have been considered as one of the common practices for image generation, due to the fast
inference at synthesizing high-resolution images (Brock et al., 2019; Karras et al., 2020b; 2021).
Inspired by recent GAN architectures (Karras et al., 2020b; Skorokhodov et al., 2021a) and training
techniques, (Zhao et al., 2020; Karras et al., 2020a), we extend these methods for video generation."

their significant achievement, a large gap still exists between generated results and large-scale real-

its efficacy in modeling complex signals such as static (Chen et al., 2021b; Park et al., 2021; Martin-

INCORPORATING TEMPORAL DYNAMICS FOR IMPLICIT GANS,0.20058997050147492,"Our method, DIGAN, is an INR-based video GAN that incorporates the temporal dynamics into
the INRs. Recall that the video INRs only differ from the image INRs by an extra time coordinate,
i.e., an input becomes a 3D coordinate (x, y, t) from a 2D coordinate (x, y); hence, one can utilize
the implicit image GANs for video generation by only expanding the input dimension of INRs by
one (for the time coordinate). However, we found that a careful generator and discriminator design
notably improves the generation quality and training efficiency. We provide the overall illustration
of DIGAN in Figure 2, and explain the details of DIGAN in the remaining section."
INCORPORATING TEMPORAL DYNAMICS FOR IMPLICIT GANS,0.20353982300884957,"Generator. A na¨ıve extension of implicit image GANs for synthesizing video INRs v(x, y, t; ϕ) is
to utilize them intactly, only modifying the first layer of INRs to handle the extra time coordinate
(we assume that the INRs follow the MLP structure). This approach synthesizes the entire INR
parameter ϕ at once, which overlooks the difference in space and time of videos, e.g., the smooth
change of frames over the time direction. To alleviate this issue, we first notice that the spatial and
temporal terms of video INRs can be easily decomposed. Specifically, the output of the first layer
(without sinusoidal activations) of video INRs can be interpreted as σxwxx + σywyy + σtwtt + b,
where wx, wy, wt, b are weights and biases of the first layer and σx, σy, σt > 0 are frequencies of
coordinates x, y, t. Here, note that only the term σtwtt differs from the image INRs, so the outputs
(of the first layer) of video INRs can be viewed as a continuous trajectory over time t from the initial
frame (at t = 0) determined by the content parameter ϕI := ϕ \ {wt}. Inspired by this space-time
decomposition view, we incorporate the temporal dynamics into the motion parameter wt."
INCORPORATING TEMPORAL DYNAMICS FOR IMPLICIT GANS,0.20648967551622419,"To be specific, we propose three components to improve the motion parameter wt considering the
temporal behaviors. First, we use a smaller time-frequency σt than space-frequencies σx, σy since
the video frames change relatively slowly over time compared to the spatial variations covering
diverse objects in images. It encourages the videos to be coherent over time. Second, we sample a
latent vector for motion diversity zM ∼pM(zM) in addition to the original content (image) latent
vector zI ∼pI(zI). Here, the content parameter ϕI = GI(zI) is generated as the prior implicit
image GANs, but the motion parameter wt = GM(zI, zM) is conditioned on both content and
motion vectors; since possible motions of a video often depend on the content. Finally, we apply a
non-linear mapping fM(·) on top of the motion features at time t to give more freedoms to motions,
i.e., fM(wtt). These simple modifications further improves the generation quality (Section 4.1)
while creates diverse motions (Section 4.2)."

INCORPORATING TEMPORAL DYNAMICS FOR IMPLICIT GANS,0.25958702064896755,"Discriminator. As the generated videos should be natural in both images and motions, prior works
on video GANs are commonly equipped with two discriminators: an image discriminator DI and
a motion (or video) discriminator DM (Clark et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2021).4 For the image dis-
criminator, one can utilize the well-known 2D convolutional architectures from the image GANs.
However, the motion discriminator needs an additional design, e.g., 3D convolutional networks,
where inputs are a sequence of images (e.g., the entire videos). The 3D convolutional motion dis-
criminators are the main computational bottleneck of video GANs, and designing an efficient video
discriminator has been widely investigated (Saito et al., 2020; Kahembwe & Ramamoorthy, 2020)."
INCORPORATING TEMPORAL DYNAMICS FOR IMPLICIT GANS,0.26253687315634217,"Instead of the computationally expensive 3D architectures, we propose an efficient 2D convolu-
tional video discriminator. Here, we emphasize that video INRs can efficiently generate two frames
of arbitrary times t1, t2 unlike autoregressive models which require generating the entire sequence.
Utilizing this unique property of INRs, we adopt the image discriminator to distinguish the triplet
consists of a pair of images and their time difference (it1, it2, ∆t) for ∆t := |t1 −t2|, by expanding
the input channel from 3 to 7. Intriguingly, this discriminator can learn the dynamics without ob-
serving the whole sequence (Section 4.1). Moreover, we note that the two frames of INRs are highly
correlated due to their continuity; the discriminator can focus on the artifacts in the motion."

Table 1 exhibits that DIGAN significantly outperforms the prior work on all datasets, e.g., improves
the FVD of MoCoGAN-HD from 833 to 577 (+30.7%) on UCF-101. We remark that the Fr´echet
inception distance (FID; Heusel et al. (2017)), a metric for image quality, of DIGAN is similar to

INTRIGUING PROPERTIES"
INTRIGUING PROPERTIES,0.35693215339233036,"Long video generation. The primary advantage of DIGAN is an effective generation of long and
high-quality videos, leveraging the compact representations of INRs. We also remark that DIGAN
can be efficiently trained on the long videos, as the motion discriminator of DIGAN only handles a
pair of images instead of long image sequences. To verify the efficacy of DIGAN, we train a model
using 128 frame videos of 128×128 resolution from the TaiChi dataset. Figure 1 shows that DIGAN
produces a long and natural motion with reasonable visual quality. To our best knowledge, we are
the first to report 128 frame videos of this quality. See Appendix F for more results."
INTRIGUING PROPERTIES,0.35988200589970504,"Time interpolation and extrapolation. DIGAN can easily interpolate (i.e., fill in interim frames) or
extrapolate (i.e., create out-of-frame videos) videos over time by controlling input coordinates. The
videos inter- or extra-polated by DIGAN are more natural than those from discrete generative mod-
els, as INRs model videos continuously. Table 2 shows that DIGAN outperforms MoCoGAN-HD
on all considered inter- and extra-polation scenarios. In particular, DIGAN is remarkably effective
for time extrapolation as INRs regularize the videos smoothly follow the scene flows defined by
previous dynamics. Figure 4 shows that DIGAN can even extrapolate to 4× longer frames while
MoCoGAN-HD fails on the Sky dataset. See Appendix G for more results."
INTRIGUING PROPERTIES,0.36283185840707965,"Non-autoregressive generation. DIGAN can generate samples of arbitrary time: it enables DIGAN
to infer the past or interim frames from future frames or parallelly compute the entire video at once.
It is impossible for many prior video generation approaches that sample the next frame conditioned
on the previous frames in an autoregressive manner. Figure 5 visualizes the forward and backward
prediction results of DIGAN on the TaiChi dataset, conditioned on the initial frame indicated by
the yellow box. Here, we find the content and motion latent codes by projecting the initial frames
of t = {6, 7, 8} and predict the frames of t ∈{3, . . . , 11}. DIGAN well predicts both past and
future motions, e.g., slowly lowering arms. DIGAN can also infer the interim frames from past and
future frames, as shown in Appendix E.2. On the other hand, Table 3 shows the generation speed of
DIGAN is much faster than its competitors, VideoGPT and MoCoGAN-HD. Different from prior
works, we remark that DIGAN can compute multiple frames in parallel; generation can be N times
further faster under N number of GPUs. For more analysis about the efficiency, see Appendix I."

contribute to the generation performance measured by FVD scores on the UCF-101 dataset. We note
that the motion vector zM and MLP fM(·) remarkably affect FVD when applied solely, but the all-
combination result is saturated. On the other hand, Figure 10 verifies that the motion discriminator
considers the time difference ∆t of a given pair of images. Specifically, we provide a far image pair
(i0, i1), i.e., the first and the last frames, with the time difference ∆t. The motion discriminator
thinks the triplet (i0, i1, ∆t) is fake if ∆t ≈0 and real if ∆t ≈1, as the real difference is ∆t = 1.
Namely, the discriminator leverages ∆t to identify whether the input triplets are real or fake."

ETHICS STATEMENT,0.4277286135693215,"Video generation has potential threats of creating videos for unethical purposes, e.g., fake propa-
ganda videos of politicians or sexual videos of any individuals. The generated videos, often called
DeepFake, have arisen as an important social problem (Westerlund, 2019). To tackle the issue, there
have been enormous efforts in detecting fake videos (e.g., Guera & Delp (2018)). Here, we claim
that the generation and detection techniques should be developed in parallel, rather than prohibit-
ing the generation research itself. This is because the advance of technology is inevitable, and such
prohibition only promotes the technology hide in the dark, making them hard to pick out."
ETHICS STATEMENT,0.4306784660766962,"In this respect, the generative adversarial network (GAN) is a neat solution as it naturally trains both
generator and discriminator (or detector). Notably, the discriminator trained by GAN can effectively
detect the fake samples created by other generative models (Wang et al., 2020). Our proposed video
generation method, DIGAN, is also built upon the GAN framework. In particular, we introduced
a discriminator that identifies the fake videos without observing long sequences. We believe our
proposed discriminator would be a step towards designing an efficient DeepFake detector."

ADDITIONAL RELATED WORK"
REFERENCES,0.8259587020648967,"Video prediction. A related but distinct area, video prediction, aims to forecast future video frames
from early frames (Srivastava et al., 2015; Finn et al., 2016; Denton & Birodkar, 2017; Babaeizadeh
et al., 2018; Denton & Fergus, 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Villegas et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020;
Franceschi et al., 2020; Luc et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021). By restricting the distribution conditioned
on initial frames, video prediction models often show better visual quality than video generation
(Babaeizadeh et al., 2021). Also, video prediction models employ image-to-image architectures as
they only need to modify the initial frames regarding the motion, while video generation models
use latent-to-image architectures. While our primary focus is video generation, one can utilize our
model for video prediction by projecting initial frames into the corresponding latent codes."
REFERENCES,0.8289085545722714,"Video synthesis with motion and content decomposition. For better video generation or prediction
with controllability, several works have proposed methods to decompose the motion and contents.
Specifically, they model videos with a content vector and a sequence of motion vectors from different
subspaces, incorporating distinct motion and content encoders for a prediction (Villegas et al., 2017;
Hsieh et al., 2018) or generators for a generation (Tulyakov et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2021; Munoz
et al., 2021). Similarly, we utilize two generators, but the motion is represented as a single vector of
the weight of implicit neural representations rather than a sequence of latents."
REFERENCES,0.831858407079646,"Concurrent work. A concurrent work, StyleGAN-V (Skorokhodov et al., 2021b), also focuses on
generative modeling of videos by interpreting videos as continuous signals. Moreover, it shares many
similar ideas with DIGAN, e.g., a motion discriminator without 3D convolution networks. However,
it has a core difference to DIGAN; DIGAN treats videos as spatiotemporally continuous signals,
while StyleGAN-V extends StyleGAN2 (Karras et al., 2020b) by interpreting videos as temporally
continuous signals (but not spatially continuous), i.e., video frames are discrete 2D grids."

permit the variations much. Intuitively, the next move of TaiChi is mostly determined by the prior
frames: the movement follows the pre-defined gestures. Sky permits some variations as shown in
Figure 6, but the wind direction determines the global motion. UCF-101 has the largest freedom of
motion as the dataset contains videos of various actions and diverse objects."

EFFICIENCY OF DIGAN"
REFERENCES,0.943952802359882,"In addition to the computational efficiency on inference (in Table 3), we provide the analysis of
our method on efficiencies of diverse aspects, including computation, energy, memory, and time
efficiency. Here, we mainly compare our method with MoCoGAN-HD (Tian et al., 2021), which is
an energy-efficient (i.e., shorter GPU days for training) and state-of-the-art method on the generation
quality. All experiments are performed under the same machine (NVIDIA V100 32GB GPUs)."
REFERENCES,0.9469026548672567,"• Computational efficiency. We report floating point operations per second (FLOPS)8 of video
GAN generators (following Liu et al. (2021)). The DIGAN generator requires 147.9 GFLOPS to
generate a 16 frame video of 128×128 resolution, 4.6 times smaller than 682.3 GFLOPS of the

than MoCoGAN-HD."

generator and discriminator of our method are much more time-efficient; recall that we already
demonstrated that our generator is ∼2.3 times faster per each GPU in Table 3."
REFERENCES,0.9587020648967551,"In summary, DIGAN is more computation-efficient (> 4.6 times), energy-efficient on training (> 2
times), memory-efficient on training (> 2.9 times), and time-efficient on inference (> 3.2 times) un-
der each machine setup above. Such gaps stem from the fact that our method utilizes: (a) INR-based
generator without time-consuming autoregressive modeling and (b) 2D convolutional discriminator
rather than computationally heavy 3D convolutional discriminator. Finally, we emphasize that DI-
GAN can synthesize multiple frames of a video in parallel (which is impossible under prior autore-
gressive or convolutional network-based methods), resulting in N times improved time-efficiency to
generate a single video under N number of GPUs. It can be particularly important for synthesizing
extremely long videos; since it requires tremendous time if utilizing prior methods that are impossi-
ble to compute frames in parallel. Like this, the superiority of computational efficiency of DIGAN
can be further dramatically improved in the presence of multiple GPUs."
