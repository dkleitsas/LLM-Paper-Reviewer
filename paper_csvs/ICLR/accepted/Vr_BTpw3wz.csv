ABSTRACT,0.004694835680751174,"Many text generation systems beneﬁt from retrieving passages from a textual
knowledge corpus (e.g., Wikipedia) and using them to generate the output. For
open-ended generation tasks, like generating informative utterances in conversa-
tions, many varied passages z are relevant to the context x but few are relevant
to the observed next utterance y (label). For such tasks, existing methods (that
jointly train the retriever and generator) underperform: during training the top-k
context-relevant retrieved passages might not contain the label-relevant passage
and the generator may hence not learn a preference to ground its generated out-
put in them. We propose using an additional guide-retriever that also conditions
on the observed label y and “in hindsight” retrieves label-relevant passages dur-
ing training. We maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBo) to jointly train the
guide-retriever Q(z|x, y) with the standard retriever Pη(z|x) and the generator
Pθ(y|x, z) and ﬁnd that ELBo has better inductive biases than prior work. For in-
formative conversations from the Wizard of Wikipedia dataset, with our posterior-
guided training, the retriever ﬁnds passages with higher relevance in the top-10
(23% relative improvement), the generator’s responses are more grounded in the
retrieved passage (19% relative improvement) and the end-to-end system produces
better overall output (6.4% relative improvement)."

INTRODUCTION,0.014084507042253521,"In knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, models must use open-domain knowledge to answer questions
(Kwiatkowski et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2017), fact-check claims (Thorne et al., 2018) or engage
in informative conversations (Dinan et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018). State-of-the-art models for
open-domain question answering are retrieval-augmented: they extract relevant passages from a
human-readable corpus (e.g., Wikipedia) using a learned retriever and process it with a task-speciﬁc
reader. If the relevant passage is known (e.g., human-annotated gold passage), the retriever can be
supervised with it. In this work we consider open-ended generation tasks where the gold-passages
are unknown. Figure 1 illustrates this one-to-many setting: for a conversational context x, many
relevant passages z (dubbed context-relevant passages) could have generated many coherent re-
sponses. But only zgold (dubbed label-relevant passage) generates the observed target output y.
Had we known zgold corresponding to the target output, we could have supervised the retriever with
zgold and trained the generator conditioned on zgold – but we don’t!"

Model-
ing the label-posterior distribution Q(z|x, y) with a full-ﬂedged retriever generalizes weak su-
pervision approaches and retrieves label-relevant passages from the entire collection. We jointly
optimize the retriever, posterior-guide, and generator using the evidence lower bound (ELBo):
Ezi∼Q(.|x,y)[log Pθ(y|x, z)] −DKL(Q|Pη). While the objective function is a lower bound, it en-
codes biases that improve joint-training on open-ended tasks: (1) conditioning the generator on the
passages weighted by their label-relevance (from the label-posterior distribution) increases ground-
ing and (2) training the retriever with a mode-seeking reverse-KL divergence encourages it to match
some modes with the guide (label-relevant passages), with a lesser penalty for matching other modes
(other context-relevant passages)."
INTRODUCTION,0.046948356807511735,"Our main contribution is a complete HINDSIGHT training system that: (1) uses a guide-retriever to
provide a stronger learning signal for both the generator and the retriever and (2) is amenable to
index-updates with iterative closed-set training (Section 3). To evaluate one-to-many open-ended
generation tasks, it is insufﬁcient to just evaluate the end-to-end performance of the joint system.
Thus, we also evaluate the individual models (retriever and generator) and at varying passage depths.
Using HINDSIGHT on the Wizard of Wikipedia dataset of informative conversations: the retriever
ﬁnds more relevant passages with a 23% relative improvement (r.i.) in success@10 (i.e., is the
label-relevant passage among the top-10 retrieved passages?), the generator is more grounded with
19% r.i. in Novel-F1 overlap with the top-1 retrieved passage (i.e., its overlap with the retrieved
passage excluding words that are common or in the input) and the combined system is overall better
with a 6.4% r.i. in Novel-F1@1 overlap with the gold utterance (the best matching generation when
considering top-1 retrieved passage). HINDSIGHT also improves performance on the MS-MARCO
NLGen dataset, a one-to-one free-form QA task."

BACKGROUND"
BACKGROUND,0.056338028169014086,"Open-domain Question Answering
In the reading comprehension task, a passage is given and
the models extract the answer span from it. In Open-domain QA (a.k.a. open-QA) no such passage
is given; the models are expected to extract the answer from a large document corpus. Dr. QA (Chen
et al., 2017), the ﬁrst neural system for factoid open-QA, used an off-the-shelf retriever (e.g., TF-
IDF, BM25) to ﬁnd relevant passages and trained a reader to extract the answer span. Now, trainable
neural retrievers have replaced the classical term-matching retrievers. Here, pre-trained models (like
BERT) embed the document corpus and the query into a single vector space and efﬁcient nearest-
neighbour search algorithms (Jegou et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2017) ﬁnd the relevant passages
corresponding to the query. The neural retriever can be trained variously: pretraining with the
inverse cloze task then weakly supervising using span matches (Lee et al., 2019), using gold passages
with in-batch negatives (Karpukhin et al., 2020), and retrieval-guided supervision with span-based
positives (Khattab et al., 2021)."

BACKGROUND,0.06572769953051644,"Open-ended Generation
Natural language generation tasks provide some input (sequence of
tokens, image) and expect the system to produce another sequence of tokens (or word-pieces) as
output. An open-ended task accepts a higher diversity of generations. Factoid question-answering
with a single correct short answer is less open-ended than free-form long answers. Machine transla-
tion accepts a few correct translations (Bojar et al., 2014) but they are less diverse than informative
dialogue, where the speakers can lead the conversation in many different directions (Dinan et al.,
2019), making it more open-ended. Many more generation tasks such as summarization (Narayan
et al., 2018) and story generation (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016) lie on this spectrum."

Khandelwal et al. (2020) retrieve similar contexts from the
training set at each time-step and increase the likelihood of tokens that were predicted in similar
contexts. Guu et al. (2020) instead pre-train a retrieval-augmented masked language model using
salient-span masking and ﬁne-tune it on downstream QA tasks."
BACKGROUND,0.07511737089201878,"Using labels for direct supervision
Zheng et al. (2020) use term-overlap with the label as a
heuristic to identify the gold-passage from a small passage set (∼50) and train a reranker. Prior
work has also modeled the posterior of various probabilistic models (Lian et al., 2019; Kim et al.,
2020; Zhan et al., 2021) or used reinforcement learning (Zhao et al., 2020) to improve knowledge
selection from the small passage set. In Zheng et al. (2021), the authors increase grounding by using
the label to reweigh passage tokens and in Cai et al. (2019) they increase grounding by feeding a
corrupted version of the label to the generator as a stand-in for the label-relevant passage during
training."
BACKGROUND,0.07981220657276995,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Lewis et al. (2020) introduce retrieval-augmented generation,
where, for input x and output y, a retriever ﬁnds top-k passages (z) from a corpus and jointly train
it with a generator (Pθ) by maximizing the likelihood of the output marginalized over the top-k
documents. In this work, we refer to this loss function as the MARGINALIZEDLOSS:"

the retriever to score label-relevant passages higher than other passages) and keeping the generator
grounded (i.e., maximizing the probability of the target output given the context-relevant passages).
In the next section we introduce a guide-retriever to capture the label-relevance and we train it using
ELBOLOSS, a lower bound to MARGINALIZEDLOSS, that has better inductive biases."

more on the retrieved passages rather than its internal language model. The second term is the KL

many tasks, which have many context-relevant passages but few label-relevant passages, this term
captures the intuition that the retriever be penalized heavily if it doesn’t retrieve the label-relevant
passage but lightly if it retrieves other context-relevant passages that happen to not be label-relevant."

for each retriever and query. Then, in the fast inner loop, we train the models for multiple epochs
by sampling passages from the ﬁxed closed-set and recomputing the probability distributions. The
trained models are then used in the next round."
TRAINING WITH HINDSIGHT,0.14084507042253522,"Posterior as a retriever
Rather than modeling the label-posterior Q(z|x, y) as a re-reranker (that
merely reranks documents as retrieved by the retriever Pη), we model it as a guide retriever that
ﬁnds label-relevant passages from the entire corpus. We sample passages from the label-posterior
distribution, and estimate the ELBOLOSS more accurately than using passages from Pη(z|x). The
guide retriever generalizes weak supervision approaches (Lee et al., 2019; Guu et al., 2020) and
relevance-guided supervision (Khattab et al., 2021), to posterior-guided supervision with a learned
posterior retriever rather than brittle heuristics based on word-overlap."
TRAINING WITH HINDSIGHT,0.14553990610328638,"Iterative closed-set training
Prior works (Guu et al., 2020; Khattab et al., 2021) intermittently
update the passage index during training. To allow for such a workﬂow, we organize our training into
rounds (see Figure 2). At the beginning of each round, in the outer loop, we encode the passages and
the queries with various retrievers and ﬁnd the highest scoring r passages that we dub the closed-
set. In the inner loop that runs for many epochs, we sample k (= 8) passages from the closed-set
(r = 100). This is fast because we are no longer retrieving from the entire corpus in the inner loop
and also sufﬁcient because the closed-set has a high recall. During the inner loop, we update the
retrievers (both document and query encoders) and use the latest model parameters for computing
the loss functions. A round results in trained models that are then used for the next round. We ﬁnd
that 2 rounds are often sufﬁcient, with decreasing marginal utility from the third round onward."
TRAINING WITH HINDSIGHT,0.15023474178403756,"Distributional repositioning before inference
We approximate the expectation terms in EL-
BOLOSS by sampling k passages from the closed-set Qtop-r(.|x, y), which provides better super-
vision than Pη(z|x) and leads to faster training. However, the models only ever get exposed to
passages from the Q(.|x, y) distribution, which limits their ability to generalize over passages from
Pη(.|x) during inference. To remedy this, we instead sample passages from an α-mixture of the two
distributions: with probability α, z ∼Pη(.|x) and with probability 1 −α, z ∼Q(.|x, y). In the
initial rounds we set low values of α and increase it toward the end to reposition the passage distri-
bution and better match with Pη(.|x) at test time. The retriever and the generator can be trained by
sampling passages from different α-mixtures and we utilize this to avoid retriever overﬁtting (with
α = 1) while maintaining generator groundedness (with α = 0.25, 0.5)."
TRAINING WITH HINDSIGHT,0.15492957746478872,"Training individual models to convergence
In practice, the retriever and the generator when
jointly trained converge at different times. The single loss term in MARGINALIZEDLOSS (Eq. 1)
hides the convergence of individual models; one model starts to overﬁt while the other model still
hasn’t converged. With ELBOLOSS, there are two terms in Eq. 2: the ﬁrst connecting Q(z|x, y) and
Pθ(y|x, z), the second connecting Q(z|x, y) and Pη(z|x). After training for a few epochs, we freeze
the guide and train the models independently until convergence based on their individual losses."

RELEVANCE EVALUATION,0.3051643192488263,"Effect of the guide-retriever
MARGINALIZEDLOSS depends on the retriever Pη(z|x) to ﬁnd
label-relevant passages during training and is therefore recall limited. MARGINALIZEDLOSS’s suc-
cess@100 on Wizard of Wikipedia saturates at 55.8% (not reported in the table) without much
hope of further improvement because zgold that are never retrieved cannot provide positive exam-
ples for supervision. With ELBOLOSS, the guide-retriever retrieves label-relevant passages with
>85% success@10 (Table 8) for both the datasets providing better supervision than MARGINAL-
IZEDLOSS. Consequently, ELBOLOSS retriever’s success@5 is higher than MARGINALIZEDLOSS
despite containing 20× less passages and reaches 69.3% for success@100."
RELEVANCE EVALUATION,0.30985915492957744,"Comparison with Gold-supervised retriever
We ﬁnd that the Gold-sup. retriever quickly over-
ﬁts during training resulting in a lower performance than using ELBo loss. We also see lower
performance when training with ELBOLOSS while sampling purely from Q(.|x, y) (i.e., α = 0,
Table 7) because it is low-entropy and the same label-relevant passages get repeatedly sampled. By
sampling from Pη(.|x), the KL divergence is minimized over a wider and realistic support set of pas-
sages. Perhaps, there are many passages that have some label-relevant phrases making them partially
relevant and Q(z|x, y) “teaches” Pη(z|x) to capture these phrase-level relative differences. Sam-
pling from Pη(.|x) leads to better generalization, has similarities to distillation and is an interesting
direction for future work."
RELEVANCE EVALUATION,0.3145539906103286,"Overall, we ﬁnd that ELBOLOSS improves relevance of retrieved passages over MARGINALIZED-
LOSS for two qualitatively different tasks, with larger gains for the one-to-many generation task."

GROUNDEDNESS EVALUATION,0.323943661971831,"We now examine RQ2, studying the degree to which the generator relies on the retrieved passages
for producing its output. To quantify this groundedness, we compute F1-overlap between a retrieved
passage (not necessarily the gold passage) and the produced text when generation is conditioned
on that passage. We get the retrieved passages for each method (except generator-only) using the
corresponding retriever."
GROUNDEDNESS EVALUATION,0.3286384976525822,"As an analogue of Success@k, we propose Max. F1@k, the largest F1-overlap exhibited by any
generated output with the corresponding retrieved passage fed to the generator. We also propose
Novel-F1, a new metric that discounts words that occur frequently and words that already appear
in the context x, since otherwise these tokens dominate raw F1 in practice (up to 80%, see Ap-
pendix A.5) but are not indicative of grounding."

Gen dataset, we observe smaller but consistent gains in groundedness (1–2 F1, Novel-F1) with EL-
BOLOSS compared to MARGINALIZEDLOSS. In Figure 3 (right), MARGINALIZEDLOSS genera-

spite being maximally grounded (Appendix table 5), has lower end-to-end performance (Appendix
table 6) because it is unduly “trusting” of the provided passage (nearly ﬂat line in Figure 3) and
does not abstain from using irrelevant passages. We see the same effect with the Gold-supervised

tion 4.5) of the decoded output with the human-written gold output. To allow for the possibility of
the generator using any part of the gold passage (and not just the human-written gold output) for the
Wizard Of Wikipedia task, we use Knowledge-F1 (deﬁned by Shuster et al. (2021)): F1 between the
sampled generation and the gold passage. Since it is reasonable to expect the gold passage to be in
the top-k for k>1 for one-to-many tasks (as in Section 4.5), we also compute the max. over top-k
retrieved passages."
END-TO-END EVALUATION,0.3615023474178404,"The results are summarized in Table 3. For the Wizard of Wikipedia dataset, using only the top
retrieved passage ELBOLOSS leads to 6.7% relative improvement in Novel-F1@1. But in the one-
to-many setting, the label-relevant passage is an arbitrary choice from amongst the context-relevant
passages. We account for that using max. overlap over the top-5 passages and see larger improve-
ments for ELBOLOSS , namely 1 F1, 2 Novel-F1 (∼15% r.i.), and 1.5 K-F1 (∼10% r.i.). For MS
Marco NLGen, we see a small but consistent increase due to ELBOLOSS over MARGINALIZED-

MARGINALIZEDLOSS across all metrics (see Table 4). The table also reports Recall@5, which
evaluates retrieval at a coarser granularity, namely at the full Wikipedia page level, though so far
we have investigated it directly at the passage level. Consistent with the results in Table 1, our
method also outperforms MARGINALIZEDLOSS in retrieval metrics. In fact, our ELBOLOSS model

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.38028169014084506,"Hallucination, grounding and correctness
Shuster et al. (2021) show that providing retrieved
passages to a generator reduces hallucination. Our work increases grounding in the retrieved pas-
sage, promising to further reduce hallucination. Even though the generator is now more likely to use
content from the provided passage (rather than hallucinating from parametric memory), that does
not guarantee correctness. Our token-level overlap metrics that evaluate grounding do not capture
this aspect either. There is scope for future work to address this gap with better training methods
(and evaluation metrics) that produce (and reward) grounded and correct outputs."
DISCUSSION,0.38497652582159625,"Practical matters: Trust and control
For tasks like QA, we want a “conservative” generator:
it should abstain from using a passage that doesn’t contain the answer. For more open-ended tasks
like informative conversations, we want the generator make use of diverse passages. In our work,
we show that by reducing α, the distribution of the passages shifts from Pη(.|x) to Q(.|x, y) and

Further, when a “trusting” generator is deployed in real-life settings (e.g., in open-domain socialbots;
Paranjape et al. 2020), external business logic can select an appropriate passage from the top-k
retrieved passages and effectively control the generated content."
DISCUSSION,0.4507042253521127,"Comparison with Fusion-in-Decoder
Izacard & Grave (2021a) provide multiple passages to the
generator simultaneously and in Izacard & Grave (2021b) they use the decoder’s attention weights
over each passage for relevance supervision. However, Sachan et al. (2021) use Fusion-in-Decoder
only at inference, forgoing the decoder’s attention weights and using an equivalent version of the
MARGINALIZEDLOSS for training the retriever. In our experiments we found marginal improve-
ments while using Fusion-in-decoder at inference and we believe our approach of conditioning on
individual passages is more precise for relevance supervision in one-to-many generation tasks."
DISCUSSION,0.45539906103286387,"Inductive biases of HINDSIGHT
A learned Pη(z|x) that maximizes ELBOLOSS (a lowerbound)
will also maximize MARGINALIZEDLOSS. It can therefore seem counter-intuitive at ﬁrst that EL-
BOLOSS empirically outperforms MARGINALIZEDLOSS. We hypothesize that it better captures the
necessary inductive biases (refer Section 3). The α-mixture further loosens the bound theoretically,
inducing a bias toward the test distribution and improving generalization. Trading off theoretical
tightness of bounds for desirable inductive biases proved fruitful for us and we hope that it inspires
other researchers."

pervision for both the retriever and the generator for retrieval-augmented, open-ended generation.
During training, the guide retriever uses the target output of each example in order to ﬁnd relevant
passages, leading to better retrieval and more grounded generation. The resulting system achieves
considerable empirical improvements over existing work, improving retrieval quality by up to 23%,
grounding by up to 19%, and end-to-end output quality by up to 6.4%."

IS HIGHER GROUNDING PURELY DUE TO A BETTER RETRIEVER?"
REFERENCES,0.6948356807511737,"To test this hypothesis, we ran an ablation test, where we used the best retriever we had (from
Hindsight, α = 0) and trained a generator using Marginalized loss while keeping the retriever itself
ﬁxed. This simulates the situation where we improved retrieval independently and we want to test if
that is sufﬁcient to explain increased grounding. We see in table 5 that that the better retriever in the
ablation (Marg. Gen. with ﬁxed ELBo Ret.) leads to increased grounding compared to the generator
trained using MARGINALIZEDLOSS. However, the ablation is worse than ELBo Gen. (α = 0.25),

We conducted a small experiment with the generated output on Wizard of Wikipedia

generated output with the target output. We consistently found (across models and passage ranks)
the F1 overlap to be close to 15. This meant that by conditioning on arbitrary passages the generator
(likely by ignoring them altogether) is able to achieve around 80% of the F1-overlap of the best
performing models (∼19 F1). This can be a confounding factor for selecting models based on high
F1 overlap. A model that simply copies content from the input x can achieve high F1-overlap but
fail to using the retrieved passage to generate the output. Removing commonly occurring words"

REFERENCES,0.9765258215962441,"Since context-relevant passages have similar P(zi|x) the gradient encourages the generator to assign
equal probabilities to the target output using all context-relevant passages. We see this issue play out
empirically when using MARGINALIZEDLOSS for two different tasks: Open-Domain QA (Natural
Questions by Kwiatkowski et al. (2019)) and informative dialogue (Wizard of Wikipedia by Dinan
et al. (2019)) (Figure 4). We see that on the Natural Questions dataset, where there is typically one
correct answer, the generator produces distribution with a sharp peak that can potentially serve as an
accurate proxy for label-relevance and in turn train a good retriever. But on the Wizard of Wikipedia
dataset, the generator produces a ﬂatter distribution which is a bad proxy for label-relevance. This
provides weaker supervision for the retriever which learns a ﬂatter probability distribution as well
and is less able to differentiate context-relevant from irrelevant passages."
REFERENCES,0.9812206572769953,"We see in Figure 5 that for the Wizard of Wikipedia dataset with ELBOLOSS we obtain a sharp
distribution for Q(z|x, y) (nearly as good as Pθ(y|x, z) on NQ from Figure 4) and that the Pη(z|x)
and Pθ(y|x, z) are now sharper than MARGINALIZEDLOSS. While a sharper distribution does not
imply a better retriever and generator (they may still assign high probability to the wrong passage),
a ﬂatter distribution limits their potential. As we will see in Section 4, ELBOLOSS indeed utilizes
the potential and trains a better retriever and more a grounded generator."
