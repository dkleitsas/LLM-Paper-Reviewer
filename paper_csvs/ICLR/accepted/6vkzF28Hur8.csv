ABSTRACT,0.004739336492890996,"Humans decompose novel complex tasks into simpler ones to exploit previously
learned skills. Analogously, hierarchical reinforcement learning seeks to leverage
lower-level policies for simple tasks to solve complex ones. However, because
each lower-level policy induces a different distribution of states, transitioning from
one lower-level policy to another may fail due to an unexpected starting state. We
introduce transition policies that smoothly connect lower-level policies by pro-
ducing a distribution of states and actions that matches what is expected by the
next policy. Training transition policies is challenging because the natural reward
signal—whether the next policy can execute its subtask successfully—is sparse.
By training transition policies via adversarial inverse reinforcement learning to
match the distribution of expected states and actions, we avoid relying on task-
based reward. To further improve performance, we use deep Q-learning with a
binary action space to determine when to switch from a transition policy to the
next pre-trained policy, using the success or failure of the next subtask as the re-
ward. Although the reward is still sparse, the problem is less severe due to the
simple binary action space. We demonstrate our method on continuous bipedal
locomotion and arm manipulation tasks that require diverse skills. We show that
it smoothly connects the lower-level policies, achieving higher success rates than
previous methods that search for successful trajectories based on a reward func-
tion, but do not match the state distribution."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.014218009478672985,"While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made signiﬁcant improvements for a wide variety of con-
tinuous tasks such as locomotion (Lillicrap et al., 2016; Heess et al., 2017) and robotic manipulation
(Ghosh et al., 2018), direct end-to-end training on tasks that require complex behaviors often fails.
When faced with a complex task, humans may solve simpler subtasks ﬁrst and combine them. Anal-
ogously, hierachical reinforcement learning (HRL) uses multiple levels of policies, where the actions
of a higher-level meta-controller represent which lower-level policy to execute (Sutton et al., 1999;
Dayan & Hinton, 1992). A multitude of methods has been proposed to train HRL, such as assign-
ing subgoals for the lower-level policies (Kulkarni et al., 2016), employing pre-trained lower-level
policies (Frans et al., 2018), and off-policy RL (Nachum et al., 2018)."
INTRODUCTION,0.018957345971563982,"All HRL methods face a common challenge: switching smoothly from one lower-level policy to
another when the meta-controller directs that a switch should occur. For example, running hurdles
may require switching between running and jumping repeatedly while maintaining forward momen-
tum. Previous approaches to this challenge (Frans et al., 2018; Andreas et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019)
involve either retraining existing lower-level policies and/or introducing a new policy to execute the
switch. We focus on the latter and call the new policy the transition policy, following Lee et al.
(2019)."

and actions from the distribution of π2 using inverse reinforcement learning techniques."
INTRODUCTION,0.05687203791469194,"sparse reward that is difﬁcult to learn from due to the temporal credit assignment problem (Sutton,
1984). Instead, we use inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques to match the distribution of
states produced by the transition policy to the distribution of states expected by the next lower-level
policy (Figure 1). While the goal of IRL is infer an expert’s reward function from demonstrations
of optimal behavior (Ng et al., 2000; Ziebart et al., 2008), some recent approaches to IRL (e.g.,
Finn et al. (2016); Ho & Ermon (2016); Fu et al. (2018)) learn a policy that imitates the expert’s
demonstrations in the process. In particular, Ho & Ermon (2016) propose a generative adversarial
network (GAN) structure (Goodfellow et al., 2014) that matches the distribution of the policy (gen-
erator) with the distribution of the given data (expert demonstrations). We use this GAN structure
for distribution matching, and, consequently, we avoid the problem of designing an explicit reward
function for transition policies."
INTRODUCTION,0.061611374407582936,"Although the transition policy is trained to produce the distribution of states and actions that is
expected by the next lower-level policy, not all states in the distribution’s support have equal prob-
ability of success. To increase the rate of successful execution, we introduce a deep Q-network
(DQN) (Mnih et al., 2013) to govern the switch from the transition policy to the next lower-level
policy. The DQN has two actions, switch or stay, and a simple reward function where a positive re-
ward is obtained if the next lower-level policy is successfully executed; otherwise, a negative reward
is given. The issue of sparse rewards is present here, but it is less of an issue because of the simple
decision space."
INTRODUCTION,0.06635071090047394,"The main contribution of this paper is a new method for training transition policies for transitioning
between lower-level policies. The two parts of our approach, the transition policy that matches
the distribution of states and the DQN that determines when to transfer control, are both essential.
Without the DQN, the state selected for transition may be familiar to the next policy, but lead to
a poor success rate. Without the transition policy, there may be no appropriate state for the DQN
to transition from. The proposed method reduces issues with sparse and delayed rewards that are
encountered by prior approaches. We demonstrate our method on bipedal locomotion and arm
manipulation tasks created by Lee et al. (2019), in which the agent requires to have diverse skills
and appropriately utilize them for each of the tasks."

connect policy πa to πb. The meta-controller dictates a transition interval for each transition between
pre-trained policies—a period of time when the transition should take place. If we were to simply
switch from πa to πb at the start of this interval, πb can easily fail because it has never been trained
on the last state produced by πa. To prevent this problem, πa,b needs to be able to start from any of
the last states produced by πa and lead to a state from which πb can successfully perform the next
task. Which states are favorable for starting πb? A possible answer is the states produced by πb
itself."

πa and one from πb. From πa, we collect the states Sπa of πa at the start of the transition interval.
From πb, we collect the trajectories Tπb of πb during the the transition interval. The initial state of
the generator πa,b is set to s, sampled from Sπa. Then, πa,b tries to generate trajectories that fool
the discriminator D (Equation 2) into classifying it as an example of Tπb. The discriminator D is
trained with binary logistic regression to distinguish between the data from πb vs. πa,b. When D can
no longer distinguish between them, πa,b can be said to have a similar distribution to πb."

qa,b becomes active and generates a switch or stay action at each subsequent time step, according
to the current state. If qa,b takes the switch action, the agent switches to πb. The reward for this
transition depends on the outcome of the subtask that πb aims to complete. A positive value rs is
given if the agent completes the next subtask; otherwise, the agent gets a negative reward rf. If qa,b
takes the stay action, the policy πa,b is continued. The agent immediately receives an alive reward

endeavors to use the lower-level policies to achieve the subgoals (Kulkarni et al., 2016). Frans et al.
(2018) proposed an approach to solving unseen tasks by using pre-trained policies with the master
policy. The feudal reinforcement learning framework (Dayan & Hinton, 1992) creates a hierarchy
where there are managers and sub-managers in which a manager learns to assign subgoals to their
sub-managers (these sub-managers also have their sub-managers). All of these approaches require
switching between lower-level policies, and, in principle, their performance could be improved by
a transition policy. Because we do not alter the pre-trained policies at all, our method may perform
poorly if the task is unseen and the pre-trained policies must be ﬁne-tuned to perform well or if a
successful transition requires that the pre-trained policies are altered."
RELATED WORK,0.41706161137440756,"Our contribution is most closely related to past work on how to transition between lower-level poli-
cies. Tidd et al. (2021) introduced estimators that decide when to switch the current policy to the next
policy. They trained the estimators with the assumption that the policies have common states. Our
work is inspired by past approaches that train transition policies to connect sub-policies smoothly.
Lee et al. (2019) introduced a proximity predictor that predicts the proximity to the initial states
for the next policy. The proximity predictor is used as a dense reward function for the transition
policies, which otherwise struggle with sparse rewards. In our work, we approach the sparse reward
issue with distribution matching, and instead of transition policies producing signals for switching
policies (Lee et al., 2019), we have independent Q-networks that give the transition signals."
RELATED WORK,0.4218009478672986,"An alternative to using generative adversarial reinforcement learning to match the state and action
distribution would be to imitate the trajectories directly with behavioral cloning (Bain & Sammut,
1995; Ross & Bagnell, 2010). However, behavioral cloning suffers from the distribution drift prob-
lem in which, the more the policy generates actions, the more the actions tend to drift away from the
distribution of the expert; hence, we use the GAN structure of IRL for distribution matching."

compare our method with the performance of a single end-to-end policy (Single), only using pre-

and Lee et al. (2019)’s method. All subtask policies and the single policy are trained with TRPO
(Schulman et al., 2015). Note that we also conducted tested other training algorithms such as PPO
(Schulman et al., 2017) and SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018), but the results were comparable to TRPO.
Table 1 and 2 are the ﬁnal results, showing that our method of using transition policies and DQNs

single policy trained end-to-end or pre-trained policies with immediate transitions. These results
can be interpreted as an indication that our transition policy has succeeded in distribution matching.

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5971563981042654,"We have presented an approach for HRL in which an agent utilizes pre-trained policies for simpler
tasks to solve a complex task. Transitions between pre-trained policies are essential; hence, pre-
trained policies are often ﬁne-tuned to suit a complex task (Frans et al., 2018). Instead of ﬁne-
tuning, we introduce transition policies (Lee et al., 2019) to connect the pre-trained policies. Since
our transition policy learns the partial distribution of the following pre-trained policy through IRL,
we do not need to create a complicated reward function for a transition policy. A DQN is used
to detect states with a high transition success rate as additional assistance. HRL frameworks often
have trouble training the structure when rewards are sparse. We alleviate this issue by exposing only
exposing a DQN with a binary action space to the sparse reward signal. The DQN is less susceptible
to the sparse reward issue than the transition policy with continuous control. In our evaluation,
we ﬁnd the proposed method to be competitive with previous work in arm manipulation and much
stronger in bipedal locomotion."
CONCLUSION,0.6018957345971564,"Our framework assumes that we can prepare suitable pre-trained subtask policies for HRL. This
assumption is a strong requirement because many complex tasks are difﬁcult to decompose into
smaller subtasks, and even if decomposition is possible, the subtask policies may need to depend
on the next subgoal, i.e., if an object needs to be picked up in a certain way to allow for success in
placement. Nevertheless, since our transition policy training procedure is not dependent on explo-
ration and sparse rewards, we believe that our work can give meaningful help to existing hierarchical
methods and open new directions for HRL. Even in the case where subtask policies must be retrained
to achieve success, the distribution matching approach may be useful, e.g., by mixing the subtask
reward with the discriminator’s reward."

TRANSITION POLICY"
REFERENCES,0.9241706161137441,"To get transition polices, we use IRL, speciﬁcally the state-action discriminator (Equation (1)) pro-

policy and it is also trained with PPO according to rewards provided by the discriminator. The state-
action discriminator Dψ,φ(st, at, st+1) contains the reward approximator gψ(st, at) and the shaping
term hφ(st) that each of the networks has a two-layer ReLU network with 100 units."
