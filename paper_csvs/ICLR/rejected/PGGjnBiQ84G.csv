ABSTRACT,0.0051813471502590676,"In this paper, we present a novel approach to learn texture mapping for a 3D sur-
face and apply it to document image unwarping. We propose an efﬁcient method
to learn surface parameterization by learning a continuous bijective mapping be-
tween 3D surface positions and 2D texture-space coordinates. Our surface param-
eterization network can be conveniently plugged into a differentiable rendering
pipeline and trained using multi-view images and rendering loss. Recent work on
differentiable rendering techniques for implicit surfaces has shown high-quality
3D scene reconstruction and view synthesis results. However, these methods typi-
cally learn the appearance color as a function of the surface points and lack explicit
surface parameterization. Thus they do not allow texture map extraction or texture
editing. By introducing explicit surface parameterization and learning with a re-
cent differentiable renderer for implicit surfaces, we demonstrate state-of-the-art
document-unwarping via texture extraction. We show that our approach can re-
construct high-frequency textures for arbitrary document shapes in both synthetic
and real scenarios. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our system by applying
it to document texture editing."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.015544041450777202,"Reconstructing 3D shapes from images is a core problem in computer vision and graphics research.
With the progress in differentiable rendering (Sitzmann et al., 2019b; Kato et al., 2018; Niemeyer
et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019b), recent learning-based 3D reconstruction approaches
have achieved impressive results using 2D supervision from single image (Chen & Zhang, 2019;
Groueix et al., 2018; Choy et al., 2016; Mescheder et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018) or multi-view
images (Tang & Tan, 2018; Yariv et al., 2020). These methods achieve high quality 3D reconstruc-
tion using differentiable rendering with various 3D representations such as 3D mesh (Wang et al.,
2018), volumetric representation (Mildenhall et al., 2020), or implicit functions (Mescheder et al.,
2019). In recent neural rendering methods such as NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020) and IDR (Yariv
et al., 2020), continuous representations such as volume or implicit functions achieve signiﬁcantly
better reconstruction results than meshes or voxels because they do not discretize the 3D surface a
priori. However, these continuous representations usually do not encode explicit surface parame-
terization, allowing 3D shape re-texturing, editing the existing texture in the 2D texture space, or
recovering 2D texture from 3D surfaces. One of the most direct applications of 2D texture recov-
ery in a geometrically constrained manner, is document unwarping, i.e., inference of a document’s
ﬂatbed-scanned version from a casual photo of a potentially creased document. Whereas 2D tex-
ture recovery could be equally valuable for other domains such as garments, or faces, the existing
datasets are not directly applicable to our method."
INTRODUCTION,0.02072538860103627,"Our novel texture mapping approach learns surface parameterization for document unwarping by
learning continuous bijective functions between 3D surface positions and 2D texture-space coor-
dinates. We use a signed distance function (SDF) (Chan & Zhu, 2005) to represent geometry and
model the appearance as a function of the 2D texture coordinates. By utilizing implicit differentiable
rendering (IDR), (Yariv et al., 2020) we can reconstruct 3D shape and learn the corresponding UV
parameterization of the surface simultaneously using a per-pixel rendering loss and appropriate ge-
ometric regularizations."

corresponding 3D surface coordinates. Following IDR (Yariv et al., 2020), we obtain the 3D surface
coordinates by sphere-tracing along the ray, cast through each pixel. Our appearance rendering is
formulated as a function of the 3D and the texture coordinates. Therefore, the forward and backward
MLPs can be trained with a 2D pixel-wise loss between the rendered image and the given ground
truth image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst neural rendering method that can learn
effective UV parameterization for implicit surfaces."
INTRODUCTION,0.05181347150259067,"As a corollary, our method is also the ﬁrst method which utilizes implicit surface based neural
rendering for document unwarping. It is a challenging task due to the presence of geometric and
photometric distortions in the document. For this particular problem we introduce a prior for shape-
speciﬁc texture mapping to initialize the forward MLP (3D to 2D mapping). This prior is learned
from a large dataset of UV mapped document meshes, assuming that document texture space maps
to a 2D equiangular quadrilateral. This assumption regularizes the forward MLP to output a high-
quality texture space that avoids degenerate solutions (see Fig. 3). Moreover, we introduce a con-
formality constraint in the backward MLP, which is consistent with how paper folds happen in the
physical world, i.e., without any stretch or tear. This constraint also ensures that the backward
function is bijective and smooth (Petrini et al., 2018)."
INTRODUCTION,0.05699481865284974,"The main contributions of our paper are the following: First, we propose an efﬁcient way to learn
texture parameterization for implicit neural representations using a differentiable rendering frame-
work. Without 3D supervision, it only requires multi-view images as ground-truth and a texture
mapping prior. Second, we show that our method can be effectively used for document unwarping
tasks by learning a prior for explicit texture mapping on the document shape. We show that this
prior can be learned from a dataset of texture-mapped meshes. Third, we show that our method is
effective for document image unwarping and texture editing (see Fig. 1). We achieve a 52% relative
improvement over the publicly available state-of-the-art1 (Das et al., 2019) in terms of mean local
distortion across 500 views from ten synthetic scenes. Additionally, we achieve a ∼25% improve-
ment in optical character recognition (OCR) in terms of character and word error rate."

PREVIOUS WORK,0.08808290155440414,"Texture Mapping. Texture mapping is an essential step in the computer graphics rendering pipeline.
It deﬁnes a correspondence between a vertex on the 3D mesh and a pixel in the 2D texture image.
To ﬁnd such a mapping, FlexiStickers (Tzur & Tal, 2009) required users to specify a sparse set of
correspondences. Bi (Bi et al., 2017) proposed a patch-based texture mapping method using the
3D shape and images from multiple views. Morreale (Morreale et al., 2021) used networks to rep-
resent 3D surfaces/shapes. Besides the above general texture mapping methods, some approaches
focus on a speciﬁc object categories such as faces (Deng et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019) and human
bodies (Mir et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020). Recently, AtlasNet (Groueix et al., 2018) represented
a 3D mesh as a collection of parametric surfaces; thus, texture mapping is trivial to obtain from a
2D parametric surface. A similar idea was adopted by Bednarik (Bednarik et al., 2020) where they
introduced geometric constraints when learning the decomposition. More recently NeuTex (Xiang
et al., 2021) aims to recover the texture of a subject using NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020). How-
ever, NeuTex uses a spherical UV domain without any geometric constraints. Therefore, it is not
suitable for document unwarping. Moreover, since NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020) doesn’t learn
an explicit geometry, NeuTex requires a coarse point-cloud to initialize the backward MLP. With
an SDF based (Yariv et al., 2020) approach, our approach does not require such an initialization
routine. We jointly learn the texture mapping and the geometry from scratch."
PREVIOUS WORK,0.09326424870466321,"Document Unwarping. Document unwarping is a special application of texture mapping: the
3D object is usually a rectangular piecewise-developable surface, and the texture is well-structured,
containing straight text lines, (usually) rectangular text blocks and ﬁgures, etc. Previous work usually
adopted a two-step methodology: 1) 3D surface estimation and 2) deformed surface ﬂattening. The
3D surface of a deformed document can be estimated from shading (Wada et al., 1997), multi-view
images (Ulges et al., 2004), text lines (Tian & Narasimhan, 2011), local character orientations (Meng
et al., 2018), document boundaries (Koo et al., 2009), and learning-based strategies (Pumarola et al.,
2018). Flattening the obtained 3D surface always involves an expensive optimization process under
certain geometry constraints such as conformality (You et al., 2017) or isometries (Bartoli et al.,
2015). Flattening could be easier if the obtained 3D shape had a low dimensional parameterization
like Generalized Cylindrical Surface (GCS) (Kil et al., 2017). Some studies (Das et al., 2017; Liang
et al., 2008; Meng et al., 2015) proposed to unwarp each patch on the surface individually and then
stitch the unwarped patches together. In recent years, data-driven methods (Ma et al., 2018; Das
et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Markovitz et al., 2020; Das et al., 2021) have addressed document
unwarping by leveraging large-scale synthetic datasets. These datasets contain deformed document
images and their corresponding ground-truth UV coordinates. Methods trained on synthetic images
often suffer from generalization performance due to the domain gap between synthetic and real
data. In this paper, we utilize neural rendering techniques to learn a surface parameterization of a
deformed document. We simultaneously estimate both 3D shapes and UV coordinates with a cycle
consistency loss and geometric constraints. By leveraging the information from multi-view images,
the proposed method demonstrates better document unwarping performance compared to a previous
state-of-the-art, Das et al. (2019)."

TRAINING DETAILS
The surface MLP S(z, θ) consists of 8 layers with a hidden layer dimension of 128, with a skip
connection to the middle layer (Park et al., 2019a). Following IDR (Yariv et al., 2020), S is ini-
tialized to produce an approximate SDF of a unit sphere. The rendering network Auv has 4 layers
with hidden layer dimension of 512 and uses a sine activation function (Sitzmann et al., 2020) at
each layer. Fuv and Fz share identical architecture with 8 layers with 512 dimensional hidden units
and sine activation (Sitzmann et al., 2020). Following NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020), we use a k
dimensional Fourier mapping (χk : R →R2k) to learn high frequency details in the shape, RGB
and the UV space. For S, Auv we follow the setting of (Yariv et al., 2020), and set k = 6 and k = 4
respectively. For Fuv and Fz we empirically set number of Fourier bands k = 10. We start with an
initial learning rate of 1e×−5 and train for 150K iterations by halving the learning rate after every
50K iterations. Initially, α is set to 50 and doubled during the training after every 50K iterations. We
set γ1 = 100.0, γ2 = 0.1 and ρ = 0.001. δ1 is set to 0.001 for the initial 30K iterations. Afterward,
δ1 is multiplied by a factor 2 at every 10K iterations for a maximum of 7 times. δ2, δ3 and δ4, are set
to zero for the initial 100K iterations. Only Lz is sufﬁcient to achieve a good texture to 3D mapping
during the shape optimization phase. Afterwards we set δ2 = δ3 = 0.001 and δ4 = 0.01. The metric
tensor calculation is implemented using auto-differentiation."

EVALUATION DATASET AND METRICS"
EVALUATION DATASET AND METRICS,0.38341968911917096,"Our synthetic evaluation data consists of 10 scenes rendered using Blender following a rendering
pipeline similar to Doc3D. Each scene consists of 50 random views sampled from a 45o solid an-
gle in the upper hemisphere. The real-world evaluation data consists of 3 scenes from the dataset
of (You et al., 2017), and 9 scenes captured by us. Each scene consists of 5-20 images per scene.
We manually annotate the masks for each scene. To obtain camera poses for the real-world data,
we utilize the COLMAP (Sch¨onberger & Frahm, 2016) multi-view reconstruction pipeline. Both
synthetic and real data include the document scan, as the unwarping ground-truth."
EVALUATION DATASET AND METRICS,0.38860103626943004,"We use image-based evaluation metrics for quantitative evaluation, including Local Distortion (LD)
and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM). These are standard metrics used for document
unwarping evaluation (Das et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2018). LD is based on dense SIFT ﬂow (Liu et al.,
2011) between the unwarped and scanned images. Image similarity metric, MS-SSIM (Wang et al.,
2003) is based on local image statistics (mean and variance) of the unwarped and scanned (ground-
truth) images calculated over multiple Gaussian pyramid scales. We use the same settings as (Das
et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2018) for fair comparison."

DOCUMENT UNWARPING,0.43523316062176165,"The
primary
application
of
our
learned forward and backward MLP
is document unwarping. The quan-
titative comparison with the state-of-
the-art model (Das et al., 2019) is
shown in Table 1 for the synthetic and
real scenes. In terms of average per-
formance of all the views (all views
col. in Table 1) we improve the LD
by ∼52% compared to (Das et al.,
2019). Since we use multi-view im-
ages for training, our results are more
consistent across all the views com-
pared to DewarpNet, which is also
a key reason for the signiﬁcant im-
provement. We conjecture that (Das
et al., 2019) as a single image un-
warping method should perform well
on simpler deformations and frontal
view images. However, it is not al-
ways the case. In qualitative compar-
isons in Fig. 4, DewarpNet often gen-
erates artifacts even for reasonably frontal views and simple deformations. Comparatively, our re-
sults are qualitatively superior."
DOCUMENT UNWARPING,0.44041450777202074,"We also report in a stricter evaluation scenario (best view column of Table 1) where we compare
our results with the best possible numerical results achieved by DewarpNet from a single view in
a scene. We perform better than DewarpNet in 91.2% of all views, however when the best view
can be selected our method do slightly worse in 7 scenes. This ‘stricter’ setting shows quantitatively
competitive results compared to DewarpNet with a oracle (practically challenging) view selector.The
choice of the best unwarped result is often subjective. For a more comprehensive comparison,
we qualitatively compare the best results of DewarpNet with our results across 6 scenes in Fig. 5.
These 6 scenes are chosen among the 7 scenes for which DewarpNet achieves a better quantitative
result than the proposed approach for at least one view. In Fig. 5 our results are clearly better
than the DewarpNet in all cases, with straighter lines and better rectiﬁed structure. The evaluation
scores do not accurately reﬂect the improvement due to the sensitivity of LD and MSSIM to subtle
perceptually unimportant global transformations, such as translation of the image by few pixels.
However, such transformations do not affect the visual quality or readability of the unwarped results.
More discussion and qualitative comparison is available in supplementary material."

results in terms of mean and best evaluation score than DewarpNet in 2 out of 3 scenes. We notice
that the evaluation results are a little worse for the real scenes than synthetic scenes due to the
fewer available views (5-10 compared to 50). Moreover, there are cases like Real 6, which do not
have sufﬁcient texture. Such data are a failure case of IDR since there is insufﬁcient information to
reconstruct the 3D shape. As a result of the poor 3D shape, our texture parameterization network
produces an inferior unwarping result (More details are available in Supplementary). We also report
qualitative comparisons with You et al. (2017) and Das et al. (2019) on additional real documents in

TRAINING TIME, GENERALIZABILITY AND FUTURE WORK"
DOCUMENT UNWARPING,0.533678756476684,"Our proposed method for a scene can be trained in approximately 18 hours for 448 × 448 resolution
images using a single Titan Xp GPU. The current training time per scene is very high compared to
DewarpNet’s inference time which makes it unsuitable for real time applications. However, this is a
fast growing ﬁeld and there are multiple other works that are focusing on improving the speed and
generalization abilities (Garbin et al., 2021; Bergman et al., 2021) of neural rendering. Therefore,
obtaining a faster training scheme is considered as a future work."
DOCUMENT UNWARPING,0.538860103626943,"Our method can be applied to fabrics, which are very similar to papers and lead to practical appli-
cations of texture editing. However, none of the current 3D garment/fabric datasets (Patel et al.,
2020) can be easily adapted to train the ˆFuv prior. For more complex UV spaces (e.g., texture atlas),
learning the prior may require decomposing the shape to multiple simple UV maps. The proper way
to do this is beyond the scope of this paper, however we believe it’s an exciting future work. As
importantly, in this paper, we have introduced a number of domain speciﬁc strong constraints that
suit the rectangular paper shape. These constraints improve empirical results. More general objects
will require different constraints e.g., spherical UV domain, local scaling of the conformal map etc."

CONCLUSIONS,0.5492227979274611,"We have introduced an end-to-end trainable architecture that can simultaneously learn texture pa-
rameterized 3D shapes from multi-view images. This is the ﬁrst work to learn surface parameteri-
zation of an implicit neural representation to the best of our knowledge. We have demonstrated the
applicability of our approach on multiple synthetic and real scenes for the task of document unwarp-

ABLATION STUDY"
REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT,0.9844559585492227,"We ablate how loss terms Lz, LE, LF , and LG affect the unwarping results. We train Fuv and Fz
with different combinations of these loss terms and report the mean MSSIM and LD in Table 3.
Qualitative results for one scene are shown in Fig. 6 (appendix). In the basic version (listed as b), no
conformality constraints (LE, LF and LG) are used and wp = 1 in Lz. The b+w version introduces
a weighting function that assigns a higher value to wp if a pixel is closer to the document boundary.
Introducing this loss improves the boundary; notice the white margin at the top and bottom in the
second column of Fig. 6. Introducing the conformality constraints alleviates the unusual stretch in
the texture and improves smoothness (Fig. 6, col. 3). Using both improves the boundary and the
texture smoothness (Fig. 6, col. 4) and achieves the best result."
