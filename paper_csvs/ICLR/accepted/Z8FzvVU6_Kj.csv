ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.004524886877828055,"One-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) usually constructs an over-
parameterized network, which we call a supernet, and typically adopts sharing
parameters among the sub-models to improve computational efﬁciency.
One-
shot NAS often repeatedly samples sub-models from the supernet and trains them
to optimize the shared parameters. However, this training strategy suffers from
multi-model forgetting. Training a sampled sub-model overrides the previous
knowledge learned by the other sub-models, resulting in an unfair performance
evaluation between the sub-models. We propose Supernet with Unbiased Meta-
Features for Neural Architecture Search (SUMNAS), a supernet learning strat-
egy based on meta-learning to tackle the knowledge forgetting issue. During the
training phase, we explicitly address the multi-model forgetting problem and help
the supernet learn unbiased meta-features, independent from the sampled sub-
models. Once training is over, sub-models can be instantly compared to get the
overall ranking or the best sub-model. Our evaluation on the NAS-Bench-201
and MobileNet-based search space demonstrate that SUMNAS shows improved
ranking ability and ﬁnds architectures whose performance is on par with existing
state-of-the-art NAS algorithms."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.013574660633484163,"Recent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms often train an over-parameterized network
called a supernet to obtain supreme sub-models by sharing parameters rapidly. In this process,
the shared parameters are generally trained to reach a state where better architecture discovery is
possible through comparing the sub-models. Supernet training is usually conducted by sampling
one or more sub-models and updating them with their gradients."
INTRODUCTION,0.01809954751131222,"Since parameters are shared, learning not to be biased towards a particular sub-model is crucial in
training a supernet. However, a parameter update due to sampling a speciﬁc sub-model often causes
a bias for the sampled sub-model; the supernet forgets the knowledge learned from the previous
sampling because of the biased update, and other sub-models share the same parameters can be
degraded and underrated. Benyahia et al. (2019) referred to this phenomenon as multi-model for-
getting, and many current architecture search strategies have been designed without considering this
phenomenon."
INTRODUCTION,0.02262443438914027,"To mitigate this problem, it is important to make the supernet parameters learn unbiased features
that are globally suitable for the sub-models. Therefore, we propose a meta-learning-based approach
that enables the supernet to learn unbiased meta-features. We adopt model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML) (Finn et al., 2017; Nichol et al., 2018) during supernet training. MAML is designed to
learn the meta-features suitable for multiple tasks, and the trained meta-parameters are then quickly
adapted to an unseen task through few-shot learning while reusing the learned meta-features. We"

INTRODUCTION,0.03619909502262444,"We call the proposed supernet training algorithm Supernet with Unbiased Meta-Features for Neural
Architecture Search (SUMNAS), given that it introduces the meta-learning principle to the multi-
model forgetting problem. SUMNAS consists of two stages: supernet training and heuristic search
with sub-model evaluation. In the supernet training stage, the parameters learn the meta-features
for multiple sub-models, which can be considered as MAML’s training meta-features for multiple
tasks. The meta-parameters obtained from the supernet training can then be directly used without
additional training for comparison between sub-models during the evaluation phase."
INTRODUCTION,0.04072398190045249,"To the best of our knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst to utilize the meta-learning capability—learning
unbiased meta-features—for accurately ranking sub-models in a supernet. There have been ap-
proaches (Shaw et al., 2019; Lian et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Elsken et al., 2020) that adopt
meta-learning principles to train a supernet using various tasks and search for the best architecture
for an unseen task with a few data instances, which is the few-shot learning variant of NAS. They
train the model parameters such that the models are robust to unseen datasets. On the other hand,
we take a fundamentally different view of a task. A task usually refers to a dataset, but we show in
Section 3 that each sub-model within a search space can be regarded as a separate “task” that the
supernet has to adapt to. We therefore apply meta-learning principles to make the model parameters
robust to several different sub-models."
INTRODUCTION,0.04524886877828054,"We evaluate SUMNAS with qualitative and quantitative experiments on the CIFAR10 and ImageNet
datasets. We show that the architecture rankings SUMNAS predicts have a stronger correlation with
the accurate rankings as compared to prior NAS algorithms that use a supernet. Besides, we observe
better architecture search performance when an existing search methodology is applied to SUMNAS
and show that SUMNAS parameters properly learn meta-features by investigating the performances
of the sub-models."

PRELIMINARIES,0.05429864253393665,"One-shot NAS: In the context of a supernet that shares parameters with its sub-models, the majority
of NAS approaches use the supernet as a proxy to indirectly predict the performance of sub-models.
With the performance oracle, differentiable techniques (Liu et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019), reinforce-
ment learning (Pham et al., 2018), and heuristic methods (Guo et al., 2019; Chu et al., 2019) are used
to determine the best architecture. Although the weight sharing has signiﬁcantly improved search
speed, it is not easy to provide accurate performance indicators when using a supernet as a proxy for
sub-model performance."
PRELIMINARIES,0.058823529411764705,"One of the most difﬁcult challenges to obtaining an accurate performance oracle is overriding knowl-
edge learned by previously sampled sub-models. Researchers have recently introduced the practice
of repeatedly updating parameters through one or more sampled sub-models (Guo et al., 2019; Chu
et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). However, Benyahia et al. (2019) have shown that catastrophic forgetting
occurs in the sequential learning of sampled sub-models. Catastrophic forgetting is a phenomenon
where a neural network forgets previously learned knowledge when learning new information. In
sampling-based supernet training, repetitive sub-model sampling and training keep introducing new
information into shared parameters. The knowledge learned with the previously sampled sub-models
is forgotten due to training subsequently sampled sub-models without considering former training.
Knowledge overriding causes the predicted performance of the architectures to ﬂuctuate depending
on the frequency or the sequence of the sampled architectures, which leads to inaccurately predicted
rankings. The forgetting problem in the stochastic training of shared supernet parameters is termed
multi-model forgetting. To alleviate this problem, Benyahia et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2020) add
a regularizer to prevent weights from deviating too far from the posterior distribution learned from
previously trained sub-models."

learning, which is called Reptile. The ﬁrst-order MAML carries out task optimization using only
the last gradient calculated by the inner loop step, ignoring the second-order derivative. However,
Reptile uses the average of the gradients calculated over multiple inner loop steps to update the

META-FEATURE LEARNING,0.12217194570135746,"The approach we introduce to improve robustness against the multi-model forgetting problem is
learning unbiased meta-features. SUMNAS has two stages: supernet training and heuristic search
with sub-model evaluation, which are similar to existing sampling-based NAS algorithms (Chu et al.,
2019; Guo et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020), as presented in Figure 1. First, SUMNAS trains parameters
to learn meta-features (Figure 1 [a]), which are not biased to a speciﬁc sub-model and are suitable
for sub-models, so training them does not overwrite previously trained knowledge. Afterward, the
parameters are used to evaluate a speciﬁc sub-model during the search (Figure 1 [b])."

ever, the parameters are trained to learn unbiased meta-features. Here, the unbiased meta-features
make fair comparison possible by providing each sub-model with an appropriate level of optimized

META-FEATURE LEARNING,0.1493212669683258,"where Af is an adaptation function optimizing the parameters for the sub-model f with a few inputs.
With this optimization, parameters naturally learn meta-features."
META-FEATURE LEARNING,0.15384615384615385,"This idea is based on MAML, which targets few-shot learning of an unseen task using adaptable
parameters. MAML trains parameters to learn meta-features suitable for multiple tasks and uses
the meta-parameters to initialize few-shot learning. Training meta-parameters for a weight-shared
supernet is similar to training with MAML. We map a task used in meta-learning for few-shot
learning to a sub-model in NAS using a supernet, as seen by comparing Equation 1 with Equation 3.
In other words, the difference is that MAML minimizes the expectation of the loss across tasks, but
SUMNAS minimizes the expectation of the loss across sub-models."
META-FEATURE LEARNING,0.1583710407239819,"Interestingly, we notice that learning the meta-features in a supernet can be viewed as MAML of

META-FEATURE LEARNING,0.167420814479638,"where f i:j is a composition of sampled operators from i-th layer to j-th layer. A sampled sub-model
f 0:i−1 feeds an intermediate representation f 0:i−1(x) to the operator o. There is a distribution of
the intermediate representation fed to the operator, and the distribution is determined by a sub-
model sampled from p(f). The operator also has a target distribution of outputs to learn determined
by the sampled sub-model. In the MAML, examples fed to a meta-learning model also follow a
distribution, and this distribution is a task Ti sampled from p(T ). Thus, inputs and targets of both
a multi-task meta-learning model and an operator in a supernet follow sampled distributions. We
also aim to train an operator that works well on a set of intermediate representations provided by
a sampled sub-model, just as MAML learns to work well on a set of examples given by a sampled
task. That is, a model and a task in MAML can be mapped to an operator and a distribution of
intermediate representations fed to the operator in supernet training. In other words, we can regard
the distribution of intermediate representations as to the task for the operator, although the task for
the operator is parameterized and optimizable differently from tasks in MAML. This implies that
we can use any MAML algorithms without alteration to solve Equation 4. Moreover, it supports the
assumption that the success of the meta-learning algorithms for few-shot learning will be transferred
to NAS."
META-FEATURE LEARNING,0.17194570135746606,"However, supernet training and MAML have a fundamental difference. MAML targets to train
parameters for an unseen task, but supernet training aims to obtain parameters for pre-deﬁned sub-
models, which are known at train time, and participate in the training process. Therefore, after
our supernet training, the supernet has knowledge of the sub-models, so additional training, such
as ﬁne-tuning for each sub-model is not mandatory. In our empirical results, the additional ﬁtting
during evaluation may improve the performance of each sub-model, but the ranking performance
stays more or less the same."

RANKING PREDICTION,0.2986425339366516,"Table 1 shows the ranking ability of the seven NAS algorithms and SUMNAS. We ﬁnd that SUM-
NAS shows more than 4.3% higher Kendall tau value, compared to other state-of-the-art NAS algo-
rithms, such as SPOS, FairNAS, and Cream. Moreover, we note that SUMNAS is superior to other
NAS algorithms to resolve multi-model forgetting, such as WPL or NSAS. The outstanding ranking
capability of our supernet resulted from the robustness our meta-feature learning achieves against
multi-model forgetting. We also check whether other NAS algorithms can earn a gain from more
training time since SUMNAS consumes more time to process a single sampled sub-model because
of the inner loop (line 10 in Algorithm 1). Speciﬁcally, the training time of SUMNAS is longer than
FairNAS by a multiple of the adaptation steps because SUMNAS performs forward and backward
iterations for each sampled sub-model. For example, when the number of adaptation steps is two,
the training time of SUMNAS is twice that of FairNAS. We train supernets with FairNAS as a rep-
resentative given more training time. FairNAS shows a little improvement, but the gain is still minor
comparing that of SUMNAS. The details of the result and analysis are presented in Appendix G."

discovered by six algorithms, and our algorithm found the one on par. Considering that GDAS shows
low Kendall tau, it is clear that GDAS ﬁnds high-performance architectures but fails to properly rank
architectures. This becomes a problem for ﬁnding the best architectures that meet speciﬁc resource
constraints, such as memory consumption, MACs, or latency. The performance of architectures
found under various MACs constraints and shows this issue. The performances of architectures
found by GDAS become worse than those from SUMNAS when such constraints are given, since
SUMNAS more accurately rank all the models in the supernet as we mentioned in Section 4.2."

performance improvement of SUMNAS should be due to the effect of the meta-learning approach.
The model we found also has higher performance than many other state-of-the-art models, such as
DNA and SE-DARTS. We also note that some of the other algorithms, such as AtomNAS and DNA,

SUB-MODEL PERFORMANCE"
SUB-MODEL PERFORMANCE,0.4479638009049774,"Here, we evaluate how meta-feature learning affects the performances of sub-models in a supernet.
Since meta-features in SUMNAS cover many sub-models (as opposed to MAML meta-features,
which span multiple tasks), the overall sub-model performances using parameters of a supernet
trained with SUMNAS are more outstanding than those from a supernet trained without meta-feature
learning. We evaluate the performances of sub-models with respect to various adaptation steps to
assess the effectiveness of SUMNAS."
SUB-MODEL PERFORMANCE,0.45248868778280543,"The left of Figure 3 shows the averaged validation losses of 20 sampled sub-models during super-
net training by SUMNAS, with diverse adaptation steps. SUMNAS with adaptation step 1 (blue
lines) does not teach meta-features and is the same as FairNAS. The validation losses dramatically
decrease when meta-feature learning is applied, as shown in the results of adaptation step 2 (red).
Moreover, the losses further decrease as the number of adaptation steps increases. These observa-
tions demonstrate that SUMNAS properly teaches meta-features that sub-models generally utilize."
SUB-MODEL PERFORMANCE,0.45701357466063347,"We also measure the validation accuracies of all sub-models in supernets trained by SUMNAS,
with the various number of adaptation steps. The right of Figure 3 presents the mean and standard
deviation of the accuracies. The improvement in mean accuracy as the number of adaptation steps
increases shows that the overall performance becomes higher with meta-feature learning. This result
is consistent with the loss results and also suggests that meta-feature learning is effective. Further-
more, the increased standard deviations indicate that the performances of sub-models are distributed
over a wider range. The wider distribution of the performances means performance differences
between sub-models become larger and implies a higher resolution of ranking prediction."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.4660633484162896,"In this paper, we have proposed a new one-shot NAS algorithm which we call SUMNAS, to miti-
gate the multi-model forgetting problem. In order to achieve this, we took the idea of MAML and
applied it to supernet training so that SUMNAS learns unbiased meta-features of the sub-models.
By explicitly helping the shared parameters to learn unbiased meta-features, we were able to ad-
dress the multi-model forgetting problem efﬁciently. As a result, SUMNAS shows better ranking
performance than other state-of-the-art supernet training algorithms, and the performance of the
sub-models it ﬁnds is on par with hand-crafted models and those discovered by state-of-the-art NAS
algorithms."

KENDALL TAU"
REFERENCES,0.8280542986425339,"In Section 4.2, we measure the ranking ability with Kendall tau (Kendall, 1938) between standalone
validation accuracies from the benchmark and predicted validation accuracies from the supernet.
Kendall tau is a measure of rank correlation: the similarity of the rankings of the two variables.
Given a set of observations {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn)} of the two joint random variable X and
Y , the measure is the ratio of the discordant pairs of the observations subtracted from the ratio of the
concordant pairs. In our experiments, xi represents a standalone accuracy of architecture from the
benchmark and yi indicates the accuracy of the corresponding architecture that a supernet predicts.
The Kendall tau τ is formally deﬁned as following:"

SEARCH ALGORITHM"

crete algorithm is described in Algorithm 2. The search algorithm repeatedly generates offsprings
from the population using mutation and crossover, and keep the top P samples among the popu-
lation and the offsprings for the population of the next iteration. The mutation randomly changes
each operator to one of the others with the probability p, and the crossover randomly mixes two ar-
chitectures in the population. The search requires several hyperparameters, and we use generations
G = 30, population P = 20, the number of offsprings C = 64, mutation probability p = 0.1, and
MACs constraint M = 400(M) for the experiment."

space (Dong & Yang, 2020) and CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), we train the supernets on the
entire training set of CIFAR-10. On the test set, the hyperparameters are tuned and the reported
Kendall tau and accuracies are measured. We also search for the best architecture on the test set. We
tune the hyperparameters where the number of adaptation steps is 4, and the hyperparameter search
space is presented in Table 5. We choose the best hyperparameter set which shows the best Kendall
tau for the sampled architectures. The searched hyperparameters are listed in Table 6. The tuned
hyperparameters are also used in SUMNAS with other numbers of adaptation steps, but the learning
rate for the inner loop LRinner is scaled so that actual parameter update sizes keep the same by
multiplying 4/adaptation step. SPOS and FairNAS adopt the hyperparameters for the outer loop
of SUMNAS, but use LRmult for the learning rate, which is LRouter × LRinner with scaling as
SUMNAS where adaptation step is one."

Due to the time-consuming task of obtaining the standalone (from scratch) validation accuracies
of the sampled architectures to compute Kendall tau, we use the average validation accuracy (from
shared parameter) to determine the best performing hyperparameter set. The hyperparameter search
space is described in Table 5, and Table 6 presents the selected hyperparameters. We also adopt task
batching of MAML and aggregate the gradients of three sub-models for each operator to update its

more time to process a single sampled sub-model because of the inner loop (line 10 in Algorithm 1).
Table 8 presents the Kendall tau of FairNAS when more training epochs are given. Note that the
learning rate we use here is different from one we present in Appendix D. The supernet for FairNAS
in Table 1 is trained for 200 epochs, so the Kendall tau for more than 200 epochs shows the loss
or gain from more training time. In 400 epochs, the performance improves for 0.8%. However,
the performances degrades in 600 or 800 epochs. We conjecture that the degradation results from
cosine learning rate decay, which was used in the FairNAS paper. Increasing the number of epochs
might have resulted in longer training time in high learning rates, which might have unstabilized the
overall training. Therefore, FairNAS improves slightly with more training time, but the improvement
is minor comparing to the gain from SUMNAS."

unbiased meta feature. Consequently, an excessive adaptation step will have the effect of lowering
the ranking ability."
