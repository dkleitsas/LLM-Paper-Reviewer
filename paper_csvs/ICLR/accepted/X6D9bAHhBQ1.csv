ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.002028397565922921,"Model-based reinforcement learning has proven highly successful. However, learn-
ing a model in isolation from its use during planning is problematic in complex
environments. To date, the most effective techniques have instead combined value-
equivalent model learning with powerful tree-search methods. This approach is
exempliﬁed by MuZero, which has achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide
range of domains, from board games to visually rich environments, with discrete
and continuous action spaces, in online and ofﬂine settings. However, previous
instantiations of this approach were limited to the use of deterministic models. This
limits their performance in environments that are inherently stochastic, partially
observed, or so large and complex that they appear stochastic to a ﬁnite agent. In
this paper we extend this approach to learn and plan with stochastic models. Specif-
ically, we introduce a new algorithm, Stochastic MuZero, that learns a stochastic
model incorporating afterstates, and uses this model to perform a stochastic tree
search. Stochastic MuZero matched or exceeded the state of the art in a set of
canonical single and multi-agent environments, including 2048 and backgammon,
while maintaining the superhuman performance of standard MuZero in the game of
Go."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.006085192697768763,"Constructing plans and executing them is an important feature of human and animal behaviour. In
the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence there has been a great amount of research into adding planning
capabilities to intelligent agents. Tree-based planning algorithms have shown a lot of success in a
wide variety of environments such as card games (Moravˇcík et al., 2017), board games (Campbell
et al., 2002; Silver et al., 2016) and more recently video games (Schrittwieser et al., 2020) and
continuous control tasks (Hubert et al., 2021). Most tree search methods assume that the agent has
access to a perfect simulator of the environment, whereas real-world environments are typically
unknown."
INTRODUCTION,0.008113590263691683,"Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms combine a model-learning component, which es-
timates the dynamics of the environment, with a planning component, using the learned model as
a simulator. However, learning a model in isolation from its use during planning has proven to be
problematic in complex environments (van Hasselt et al., 2019). Instead, value-equivalent model-
learning methods (Silver et al., 2017; Farahmand et al., 2017; Oh et al., 2017; Grimm et al., 2020)
identify a model that reconstructs only those quantities required for planning. The most successful
method, MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020) learns a model that reconstructs reward, value and policy,
and uses this model to perform a powerful Monte Carlo tree search. MuZero achieved superhuman
results in Go, chess, shogi and Atari without any prior knowledge of the rules, and has also achieved
state-of-the-art performance in large and continuous action spaces (Hubert et al., 2021) and ofﬂine
reinforcement learning (Schrittwieser et al., 2021)."

be perceived by the agent as stochastic, whenever aliased states cannot be disambiguated. Similarly,
large and complex environments may appear stochastic to a small agent with ﬁnite capacity."
INTRODUCTION,0.016227180527383367,"In this paper we introduce the ﬁrst empirically effective approach for handling stochasticity in value
equivalent model-learning and planning. The model is factored to ﬁrst transition deterministically
from state to an afterstate, and then to branch stochastically from the afterstate to the next state. This
factored model is trained end-to-end so as to maintain value equivalence for both state value function
and action value function respectively, and a stochastic planning method is applied to the model."
INTRODUCTION,0.018255578093306288,"We apply these ideas to MuZero, using a discrete generative network to represent the model, and
modifying the Monte Carlo tree search to effectively use the factored model. We apply our method,
Stochastic MuZero, to several environments in which handling stochasticity is important. First, we
consider the popular stochastic puzzle game 2048, in which the prior state of the art exploits a perfect
simulator and signiﬁcant handcrafted domain knowledge. In our experiments, Stochastic MuZero
achieved better results without any domain knowledge. Second, we consider the classic stochastic
two-player game of backgammon, in which near-optimal play has been achieved using a perfect
simulator. Stochastic MuZero matches this performance without any prior knowledge of the game
rules. Finally, we evaluated our method in the deterministic board game of Go. There our method
matched the performance of MuZero, demonstrating that Stochastic MuZero extends MuZero without
sacriﬁcing performance."

RELATED WORK,0.02231237322515213,"Observation models
(Oh et al., 2015; Chiappa et al., 2017; Łukasz Kaiser et al., 2020) explicitly
learn the dynamics of an environment by ﬁtting a model of observations and rewards to observed
transitions. Subsequently, these models can be combined with a model-free learning rule in a
Dyna fashion (Sutton, 1991). However, modeling high dimensional image observations can be
computationally prohibitive, prone to high error accumulation as the model is unrolled for multiple
steps, and limiting since the capacity of the model could be spent on background features which are
not helpful for the problem at hand. These issues make such models unconducive for planning. Finally,
van Hasselt et al. (2019) argues that Dyna-based methods are unlikely to outperform model-free
approaches that use a replay buffer."
RELATED WORK,0.02434077079107505,"Latent models

attempt to overcome the limitations of observation models by learning recurrent networks that operate
on latent states. In this framework, the model is conditioned on the current observation and future
actions and is unrolled for k steps. Subsequently, it is trained to make predictions about rewards,
values, policies or observations at each timestep based on the current latent state. The model can then
be combined with a tree-based planning algorithm or used to generate synthetic trajectories. Recently,
MuZero has shown that it is possible to use this approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance in
many challenging domains (Hubert et al., 2021) while using less data (Schrittwieser et al., 2021).
However, most approaches, including MuZero, use a deterministic function to model the environment
dynamics, which limits their applicability to deterministic or weakly stochastic environments."
RELATED WORK,0.02636916835699797,"Stochastic latent models
are stochastic models of the environment dynamics that operate on latent
states. In (Hafner et al., 2021) the authors propose a recurrent state-space model which consists
of three main modules, a recurrent module which generates the deterministic recurrent state ht, a
representation model which combines ht with the current observation xt to generate a distribution
over stochastic states st and plays the role of the posterior, and a transition predictor which depends
only on ht and acts as the prior of the model. By combining the deterministic and stochastic states
ht and st the model is trained to predict the current observation ot, the transition reward rt and
the discount dt. The next deterministic recurrent state is generated using ht, st and action at. The
stochastic states st are modeled as multidimensional multinomial variables. The learned model is
then used to generate synthetic data which are used to train an actor-critic model-free agent. The
authors show that their approach outperforms pure model-free methods but it fails to achieve the
performance of MuZero which combines its learned model with planning."

RELATED WORK,0.030425963488843813,"In (Ozair et al., 2021) the authors learn a stochastic transition model using a VQ-VAE generative
network (van den Oord et al., 2017) and subsequently combine it with MCTS. They show that their
method can match the performance of MuZero in chess, while viewing the problem as a single-
player task and implicitly learning to model the behaviour of the opponent. Despite its promise
their approach was only applied in a supervised setting using expert data, and did not address the
challenges of learning a stochastic model in the reinforcement learning setting. Moreover, the learned
model was trained to explicitly predict the observation at every step, which can be a limiting factor
in terms of computation and model efﬁciency when dealing with high dimensional observations.
Finally, the authors used a two stage training process: ﬁrst, a model learns latent representations of
the observations, then these representations are used to learn a transition model. This makes it hard to
apply this approach in the reinforcement learning setting."

We consider the problem of modeling the dynamics of a stochastic environment. Simi-

to MuZero which only considers latent states which correspond to real states of the environment,
Stochastic MuZero makes use of the notion of afterstates (Sutton & Barto, 2018) to capture the

the expression one hot (arg maxi(ce,i

function of the observation which makes use of the Gumbel softmax reparameterization trick (Jang

the backward. There is no explicit decoder in our model, and contrary to previous work (Ozair et al.,

decision and chance (Couetoux, 2013). The chance and decision nodes are interleaved along the
depth of the tree, so that the parent of each decision node is a chance node. The root node of the tree
is always a decision node.
In our approach, each chance node corresponds to a latent afterstate (4.1) and it is expanded by
querying the stochastic model, where the parent state and an action are provided as an input and the
model returns a value for the node and a prior distribution over future codes Pr(c | as). After a
chance node is expanded its value is backpropagated up the tree. Finally, when the node is traversed

MuZero each internal decision node is again expanded by querying the learned model, where the
state of the chance parent node and a sampled code c are provided as an input, and the model

EXPERIMENTS,0.16024340770791076,"The game of 2048 (inspired by the game of Threes!) is a stochastic, single player, perfect information
puzzle game played on a 4x4 board. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to
combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; one can continue to play the game after reaching
the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers. The episode reward is the sum of all created tile numbers."
EXPERIMENTS,0.16227180527383367,"There is a plethora of previous work (Szubert & Ja´skowski, 2014; Yeh et al., 2017; Oka & Matsuzaki,
2016; Rodgers & Levine, 2014; Neller, 2015) on combining reinforcement learning and tree search
methods for tackling 2048. Despite its simplicity, model-free approaches have traditionally struggled
to achieve high performance, while planning-based approaches have exploited perfect knowledge
of the simulator. To date, the best performing agent used the planning-based approach proposed in
(Ja´skowski, 2016). This method used an expectimax tree search over a perfect simulator, combined
with domain-speciﬁc knowledge and a number of novel algorithmic ideas that exploited the structure
of this speciﬁc problem."

environments while maintaining the latter’s performance in deterministic environments, we compared
the performance of the two algorithms in the game of Go. Figure 4 shows the Elo (Coulom, 2008)
achieved by Stochastic MuZero and MuZero during training. Although, Stochastic MuZero requires
twice the number of network expansions in comparison to MuZero to achieve the same performance,
due to the use of a stochastic MCTS instead of a deterministic one, we ensure that the methods are
computationally equivalent by halving the network depth for the chance and dynamic parts of the

CONCLUSIONS,0.2028397565922921,"In this work, we proposed a new method for learning a stochastic model of the environment, in a
fully online reinforcement learning setting, and showed that the learned model can be effectively
combined with planning. Our approach builds on top of MuZero, a model-based reinforcement
learning agent that has been widely successful in a range of environments and settings, but its
applicability is limited to deterministic or weakly stochastic environments. We have shown that our
algorithm, Stochastic MuZero, can overcome the limitations of MuZero, signiﬁcantly outperforming
it in stochastic environments, and it can achieve the same or better performance than AlphaZero"

REFERENCES,0.33468559837728196,"The game of 2048 is a single player, perfect information, stochastic puzzle game. The board is
represented by a 4x4 grid with numbered tiles, and at each step the player has four possible actions
which correspond to the four arrow keys (up, down, right, left). When the player selects an action,
all the tiles in the board slide in the corresponding direction until they reach the end of the board or
another tile of different value. Tiles of the same value are merged together to form a new tile with a
value equal to their sum, and the resulting value is added to the running score of the game. After each
move, a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of 2 or 4. The game
ends when there are no more moves available to the player that can alter the board state."

BACKGAMMON EXPERIMENTS"
REFERENCES,0.35699797160243407,"Backgammon is an ancient two player, zero-sum, perfect information, stochastic board game. The
board consists of 24 squares (or points) and each player controls 15 checkers, which can move based
on the outcome of a dice roll. The two players move their checkers in opposite directions and their
goal is to move all their checkers off the board ﬁrst. In addition to a simple winning, a player can
also score a double (""gammon"") or a triple (""backgammon"") winning. A ""gammon"" is achieved
when a player bears off all their checkers before their opponent manages to bear off any, while a
""backgammon"" when the opponent also has checkers left in the player’s home quadrant (farthermost
quadrant from the opponent’s perspective). Each player can impede the progress of their opponent
through ""hitting"" the opponent’s checkers or blocking their advancement. A ""hit"" is achieved when
a player’s checker advances to a position with a single opponent’s checker. Then the opponent’s
checker needs to reenter the board in the player’s home quadrant and no further moves are allowed
to the opponent until that happens. A position is blocked to the opponent when it is occupied by at
least two of the player’s checkers. Each player makes moves based on the values yielded by rolling
two dice. In the case of ""doubles"", aka the two dice have the same value, the player can play up to 4
moves."

average distribution, as shown in ﬁgure 6 6. We observed that in the case of deterministic environment
like Go, the chance distribution collapsed to a single code, while in stochastic environments the
model used multiple codes. Furthermore, in Backgammon, the chance distribution had a support of
21 codes with non-negligible probability, which corresponds to the number of distinct rolls of two
