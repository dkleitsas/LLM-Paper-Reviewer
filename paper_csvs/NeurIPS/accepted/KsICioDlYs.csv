ABSTRACT,0.005714285714285714,"As the size of circuit designs continues to grow rapidly, artificial intelligence
technologies are being extensively used in Electronic Design Automation (EDA)
to assist with circuit design. Placement and routing are the most time-consuming
parts of the physical design process, and how to quickly evaluate the placement
has become a hot research topic. Prior works either transformed circuit designs
into images using hand-crafted methods and then used Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) to extract features, which are limited by the quality of the hand-
crafted methods and could not achieve end-to-end training, or treated the circuit
design as a graph structure and used Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to extract
features, which require time-consuming preprocessing. In our work, we propose a
novel perspective for circuit design by treating circuit components as point clouds
and using Transformer-based point cloud perception methods to extract features
from the circuit. This approach enables direct feature extraction from raw data
without any preprocessing, allows for end-to-end training, and results in high
performance. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in congestion prediction tasks on both the CircuitNet and ISPD2015
datasets, as well as in design rule check (DRC) violation prediction tasks on the
CircuitNet dataset. Our method establishes a bridge between the relatively mature
point cloud perception methods and the fast-developing EDA algorithms, enabling
us to leverage more collective intelligence to solve this task. To facilitate the
research of open EDA design, source codes and pre-trained models are released at

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.017142857142857144,"In recent years, the demand for semiconductor chips for various applications has been increasing,
and the need to accelerate the chip design and manufacturing process has become increasingly urgent.
And with the development of semiconductor technology, the scale of very-large-scale integrated
(VLSI) circuits is growing exponentially, challenging the scalability and reliability of the IC design
process. As a result, the industry urgently needs more efficient Electronic Design Automation (EDA)
algorithms and tools to enable the processing of huge exploration spaces in a shorter period of time.
The layout and routing phase are particularly important in the overall EDA flow. As feature size
shrinks, routability becomes a more important constraint on the manufacturability of VLSI designs.
Routing congestion can significantly affect PPA (Performance, Power, Area) metrics, and design rule
violations can directly lead to unmanufactured designs, but there is no way to obtain an accurate
congestion and design rule violations map without conducting placement and routing attempts, which
can lead to longer design cycles and possibly some unpleasant surprises. Therefore, accurate and
rapid evaluation of placement in advance of routing will be very important, and the exploration of
routability becomes one of the key issues in modern placement for VLSI circuits [27]."

INTRODUCTION,0.02857142857142857,"Before global placement, the circuit design is represented as a netlist consisting of nodes and
nets, where nodes represent specific components and nets represent link relationships between
nodes, containing topological information about the design. After the global placement, we will get
information about the specific location of each node, containing the geometric information. How to
use this information to make a fast and accurate evaluation of the placement is currently divided into
roughly two approaches: (1) using hand-crafted features to rasterize the circuit and thus convert them
into images. Then, using CNN [24, 38] or Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) [42, 1, 45] to perform
feature extraction on the circuit. (2) converting the circuit design into a graph structure and using
Graph Neural Networks (GNN) [20, 35, 15] to perform feature extraction on the circuit design."
INTRODUCTION,0.03428571428571429,"However, both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. The CNN-based methods use
some hand-crafted features (e.g., RUDY [33], node density, pin density) to rasterize the circuit and
perform feature extraction on it, where the grids are treated as pixels. Then, use classical image
segmentation networks in computer vision (e.g., UNet [32] and FCN [25]) to do the pixel-wise
prediction of labels (e.g., congestion and DRC violation). This method is simple and efficient,
however, the effectiveness of the hand-crafted features limits the network’s performance, and it can
not achieve end-to-end training. The GNN-based methods involves converting the circuit design
into a graph with vertices and edges, where nodes in the circuit are represented as vertices and nets
are represented as edges. GNN networks are then used to extract features from the graph, making it
suitable for downstream tasks. Although they have small parameters and fast inference speeds, it
is worth noting that even though the time consumption of constructing the graph structure has been
proven to be linearly related to the design scale, the design scale of chips is very large. The number
of nodes is typically in the hundreds of thousands, while the number of edges can be in the millions,
so the process of constructing the graph structure can often be very time-consuming. In addition,
these methods also use hand-crafted features when processing geometric information, which also
suffers from the aforementioned problems."
INTRODUCTION,0.04,"To address the above issues, in this paper, we approach the task of feature extraction in circuit design
from a novel perspective by treating circuit components as point clouds and using a Transformer to
solve the task, i.e., CircuitFormer. CircuitFormer avoids the two core pain points of the above two
methods: (1) there is no need to use hand-crafted features, and end-to-end training can be achieved;
(2) there is no need for any preprocessing, which greatly reduces the time of the entire process."
INTRODUCTION,0.045714285714285714,"As shown in Fig. 1, our model is divided into two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder
extracts features from the placement information of the circuit design, while the decoder adapts to
downstream tasks using a conventional backbone and segmentation head, similar to the CNN-based
methods."

INTRODUCTION,0.12571428571428572,"Our experiments were based on the publicly available CircuitNet [5] dataset and ISPD2015 [4] dataset.
Whether it is the congestion prediction task or the DRC violation prediction task, the pixel values
of their labels are continuous values between 0 and 1. The label distribution is highly imbalanced,
exhibiting a skewed distribution with a long tail. The imbalance of label distribution can make it
difficult for a model to handle corner cases, leading to overfitting and reducing the accuracy and
robustness of the model. For the regression on imbalanced datasets, we adopted label distribution
smoothing (LDS) [39] to re-weight the loss function and improve the model’s performance."
INTRODUCTION,0.13142857142857142,"In summary, our contributions are:"
INTRODUCTION,0.13714285714285715,"• Our work takes a novel perspective on circuit design by treating circuit components as point
clouds and using a point cloud perception network to extract features for circuit design.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to abstract the task of circuit design
feature extraction as a point cloud perception task. This bridges the gap between the two
fields, allowing us to transfer certain structures and conclusions from mature point cloud
perception methods to the developing EDA domain."

by an average of 3.8% and 1.5% on the CircuitNet dataset and ISPD2015 dataset respectively,
based on the average of Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation coefficients, achieving
a new SOTA. For the DRC violation prediction task, we also achieved the best performance
in most of the metrics. Our work has the potential to serve as a universal feature extractor for
chip design, which can adapt to a wider range of downstream tasks by changing the decoder."

nets serve as edges, then GAT [35] is used to extract features. [9] uses GraphSAGE [15] to extract
features from a graph with G-cells as nodes. These methods can only utilize the topological informa-
tion of the circuit design and are unable to handle geometric information. Recent advancements in
graph networks have expanded their capabilities to incorporate geometric information in addition to
topological information. LHNN [36] considers the grid as internal nodes and the net as external nodes,
constructing a homogeneous graph. CircuitGNN [40] generates a heterogeneous graph, treating both

POINT CLOUD PERCEPTION,0.18285714285714286,"2.3
Point Cloud Perception"
POINT CLOUD PERCEPTION,0.18857142857142858,"Point cloud perception methods can be classified into two categories: point-based and voxel-based.
Point-based methods [30, 31] follow the paradigm of sample, group, and fusion. They perform
farthest point sampling in the point cloud, then group points within a certain range of each sampled
point, and finally perform the fusion. These methods can preserve the structure of the point cloud
without losing information. However, due to the irregularity of point clouds, such methods are often
difficult to train in parallel and require a large amount of memory consumption. Voxel-based methods
[44] assign each point to a specific voxel and extract local features from groups of points within
each voxel. This significantly improves computational efficiency but can result in information loss.
Transformers can model the relationships between points and have vast potential in point cloud
perception tasks. However, due to the quadratic computational complexity of transformers, vanilla
transformers cannot be directly applied to point clouds. Based on this, [43] performs local attention
on a set of points after sampling to extract local point cloud relationships. [16] applies cross attention
twice between the latent code and point cloud to compress the features into the latent space, reducing
computational complexity."

Method"
METHOD,0.2,"We focus on the congestion prediction task and design rule check (DRC) violation prediction task.
Congestion is defined as the overflow of routing demand over available routing resources in the
routing stage of the back-end design, and DRC violation, as the name suggests, refers to the location
where design rules are violated. Both tasks can be abstracted as making grid-level predictions of
the circuit based on the point-wise information (geometric and topological) of the circuit design.
Specifically, we consider circuit components such as buffers, inverters, registers, and intellectual
property (IP) cores as point clouds. Here, we do not differentiate between component categories but
only focus on their fundamental geometric features, i.e., the center coordinates, width, and height of
each circuit component."

ENCODER,0.28,"Multi-scale Grid-based Attention.
Due to the complexity of circuit designs, two nodes connected
by a topological structure may be far apart in geometric positions. The hand-crafted method that only
considers the geometric features of each node within a grid cannot handle the relationships between
different grids. Therefore, we hope to introduce the attention mechanism to expand the receptive field,
model long-range dependencies, and enable interaction between different grids. However, vanilla self-
attention computation is quadratic, with a computational complexity of O(n2d), where n represents
the number of nodes, which is usually in the hundreds of thousands. Such high computational
complexity is unacceptable. Inspired by [19, 18, 23, 16], we use a fixed-length, learnable latent code
to perform two cross-attentions with the input features instead of one self-attention. This compresses
the node information into a more compact latent space and significantly reduces the computational
complexity. The validity of this method comes from the observation that the attention matrix is
usually low-rank [11, 2]."
ENCODER,0.2857142857142857,"The grid-based attention (GA) module is an improvement over the voxel-based set attention (VSA)
module [16], adapted for use with the circuit, which is referred to as pseudo-2D point clouds in our
work. The structure is shown in Fig. 2. Given an input set P ∈Rn×4 where n represents the number
of nodes. The features of each node can be represented as {Pi = (xi, yi, wi, hi) : i = 1, ...n}, xi
and yi represent the original coordinates, while wi and hi represent the width and height of the
component, respectively. And we also have information on the position of corresponding points
C ∈Rn×2, C = {Ci = ( exi, eyi) : i = 1, ...n}, where exi and eyi represent the normalized coordinates
of the nodes. We encode the node features as keys K ∈Rn×d and values V ∈Rn×d through linear
projection, same as vanilla Transformer. Randomly initialized learnable latent codes serve as queries
Q ∈Rk×d (k ≪n) and are fused with linearly projected node features to encode them into the latent
space using cross-attention. After that, we obtain the point-wise feature H ∈Rn×k×d."
ENCODER,0.2914285714285714,"Then, we convert the point-wise features to grid-wise features, the grid coordinates corresponding to
each point can be represented as G = { Gi = ([ e
xi
dx ], [ e
yi
dy ] : i = 1, ...n)}, where dx, dyis the grid size
of two dimensions, and [·] is the floor function. By changing dx, dy, we can obtain raster features of
different scales, so that we can perform multi-scale grid information exchange. To be more precise,
we established four distinct grid scales, for dx = dy = [1, 2, 4, 8]. Next, we use the scatter-sum
function to add point-wise features belonging to the same grid and obtain the grid-wise feature
A ∈Rm×k×d, where m represents the number of non-empty grids. The scatter function is a CUDA
kernel library that performs symmetric reduction on various matrix segments. The entire process is
highly parallelized."
ENCODER,0.29714285714285715,"To introduce local inductive bias, based on the coordinates of the grids, we construct a sparse
tensor I ∈Rw×h×l by assembling the grid-wise features into a image-like structure, where w and h
respectively represent the number of grids in the two dimensions, and l = k × d. To be specific, we
pad the empty grids with zeros. After that, the feature I is refined using a convolutional feed-forward
network (ConvFFN) while enabling information exchange between grids, we use two layers of
depth-wise convolution (DWConv) to achieve it. Datasets in circuit design are typically small in scale,
and this approach of combining attention mechanisms with CNNs has been shown to be effective on
small datasets [29]. This is because ConvFFN can introduce inductive bias to the model, which plays
an important role in improving the convergence of transformer on small datasets, which are difficult
to optimize."
ENCODER,0.3028571428571429,"To maintain consistency with the input dimensions, we broadcast the sparse tensor I to generate the
point-wise feature ˆH ∈Rn×k×d based on the grid indices. Finally, the refined point-wise feature
ˆH is used as the key-value pair, with the linear projection of the input serving as the query for
cross-attention. This results in an output O ∈Rn×d with the same dimensions as the input."
ENCODER,0.30857142857142855,"The encoder consists of four grid-based attention modules with different grid scales, which can
aggregate multi-scale and global geometric information in a highly parallelized manner. It has
a computational complexity of O(nkd), where k ≪n. At the end of the encoder, we use the
scatter-sum operator to generate grid-wise features and combine them into an image Y ∈RW ×H×D
according to the position coordinates of each grid, preparing it for further pixel-wise prediction. Here,
Y has the same width and height as the label."

features using the backbone, and finally adding a segmentation header for pixel-wise prediction.

RESULT OF DRC VIOLATION PREDICTION,0.52,"Table 4 shows that in the DRC violation prediction task, our work achieved the best performance in
terms of Spearman and Kendall, but the Pearson correlation coefficient is relatively low. We speculate
that this is because hand-crafted methods use the congestion map as an input feature, which contains
higher-level information than the raw data. In contrast, our method only uses the original positional

which is consistent with the labeling modality, whereas the point-based method needs to project the
point-wise information to the grid-wise prediction, which may result in information loss. Additionally,
the point-based method requires point sampling and cannot utilize information from all points. Our
method also outperforms PointPillars, which groups points within the same grid and extracts features
using MLP and Maxpooling like PointNet [30]. Similar to RUDY, this method can only extract local
features within the grid and cannot exchange features across grids. It highlights the importance of
information exchange across grids."

Conclusion and Future Work"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.7028571428571428,"We present a new perspective on circuit design, treating circuit components as point clouds. Based on
this, we propose an improved multi-scale grid-based attention module based on VoxelSet [16], which
achieves SOTA results on CircuitNet and ISPD2015 datasets. Furthermore, our work can serve as a
general-purpose feature extractor for chip design and can be adapted to a wider range of downstream
tasks. This is the first work to transform circuit design evaluation into a point cloud perception task,
presenting a novel approach to addressing the issue. It has established a bridge between the relatively
mature point cloud perception methods and the still developing EDA methods, enabling us to apply
methods and conclusions that have been proven effective in point cloud perception tasks to EDA
tasks."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.7085714285714285,"However, it should be noted that although our approach can model the relationship between points
through the attention mechanism, it still does not use the prior knowledge of topology directly.
Graphormer [41] encodes the topological relationships between nodes into the attention matrix,
which enables the fusion of topological and geometric information in the transformer. How to
incorporate the prior topological information into our model will be our future research direction."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.7142857142857143,"Last but not least, the methods we use are simple and basic ones, while the GNN-based or CNN-based
methods we compare against have been iterated in EDA for several years. However, thanks to the
active Transformer community, there are many more advanced methods available. For example,
LongNet [10] and RetNet [34] not only reduce the computational complexity to linear but also
improve accuracy. With the rise of Large Language Model (LLM), the use of Transformers for
handling long sequential data (corresponding to large-scale circuit designs in the EDA field) has
become a trend. There has been a wealth of research dedicated to improving the performance of
Transformers while reducing computational complexity. We hope to bring this trend into the EDA
domain through our work, leveraging the advancements in Transformers to enhance circuit design
tasks."
