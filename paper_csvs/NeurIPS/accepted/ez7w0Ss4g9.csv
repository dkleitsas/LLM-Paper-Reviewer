ABSTRACT,0.001402524544179523,"Two competing paradigms exist for self-supervised learning of data representations.
Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is a class of architectures in which
semantically similar inputs are encoded into representations that are predictive of
each other. A recent successful approach that falls under the JEPA framework is
self-distillation, where an online encoder is trained to predict the output of the
target encoder, sometimes using a lightweight predictor network. This is contrasted
with the Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) paradigm, where an encoder and decoder
are trained to reconstruct missing parts of the input in the data space rather, than
its latent representation. A common motivation for using the JEPA approach over
MAE is that the JEPA objective prioritizes abstract features over fine-grained pixel
information (which can be unpredictable and uninformative). In this work, we seek
to understand the mechanism behind this empirical observation by analyzing the
training dynamics of deep linear models. We uncover a surprising mechanism:
in a simplified linear setting where both approaches learn similar representations,
JEPAs are biased to learn high-influence features, i.e., features characterized by
having high regression coefficients. Our results point to a distinct implicit bias of
predicting in latent space that may shed light on its success in practice."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.004207573632538569,"Representation learning has arguably been one of the most promising prospects and longest-standing
goals of deep learning. In simple terms, representation learning refers to the process of automatically
discovering and extracting meaningful features or representations from raw data. The learned
representations can then be used to solve various downstream tasks, such as classification, and
regression, or as general-purpose representations in robotics and embodied agents. In recent years,
the practice of representation learning has witnessed remarkable strides, particularly in the domain of
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The SSL paradigm has garnered
significant attention due to its ability to exploit vast amounts of unlabeled data, freeing practitioners
from the burden of expensive annotation efforts. While many SSL approaches have been proposed in
the literature, two paradigms have emerged as particularly successful, driving the bulk of the recent
breakthroughs in the field:"
INTRODUCTION,0.005610098176718092,"Masked AutoEncoders (MAE)
The original MAE [8] and its successive variants (e.g. [13, 14])
introduced a training objective that seeks to reconstruct missing pieces of data from its partially
masked input. This approach, while simple, has proven efficient and scalable [15]. Formally, the MAE
objective uses an encoder function fW (X) : Rd →Rd and a decoder function gV (f) : Rd →Rd to
predict a target y given input x:"

INTRODUCTION,0.009817671809256662,"where we define a joint distribution over inputs and targets p = p(x, y) with x, y ∈Rd. Here we
assume tied dimensions for simplicity."
INTRODUCTION,0.011220196353436185,"In general, we can think of x and y as different inputs sharing the same underlying semantic
information. One common practice is to let the input x correspond to a partially masked input, and
the target y corresponds to the masked-out portions of the input. Note that a critical design choice
of the MAE objective is that the loss penalizes the reconstruction error directly in the target’s input
space. This implies that, as perhaps some parts of the target y cannot be predicted given x, the quality
of the encoding fW crucially depends on how x, y are sampled."
INTRODUCTION,0.012622720897615708,"Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA)
The JEPA family of models does not attempt
to predict y directly and instead opts to predict the latent representation of y given by some encoding
function. When the encoder function for x and y is shared, a simple JEPA objective is given by:"

(2)"
INTRODUCTION,0.016830294530154277,"Unlike the objective in (1), the objective given by (2) is susceptible to collapse: it can be minimized
trivially by employing an encoder and decoder that map all inputs to the same vector. Contrastive
methods [16, 6, 17] avoid this issue by including an additional loss term that pushes apart repre-
sentations for negative pairs (two different samples). The drawback to this approach is that it can
require comparing a sample to many negative examples to work effectively. This has led to a rise
in the popularity of non-contrastive SSL. With non-contrastive methods, it becomes imperative to
implicitly or explicitly bias the representation mapping fW (x) to avoid its collapse to a trivial solu-
tion (e.g., fW (x) = 0, ∀x). In this paper, we leverage the widely adopted [11] StopGrad operator,
preventing the flow of gradients through the fW (y) branch. Prominent examples of this foundational
architecture include BYOL [9], data2vec [10], SimSiam [11] and the more recent I-JEPA [18] and
V-JEPA [19] models. Consequently, the JEPA models under consideration fall under non-contrastive
self-distillation methods. We will refer to such methods as JEPA for the remainder of this paper."
INTRODUCTION,0.0182328190743338,"While both paradigms have found practical use, characterizing the implicit bias of each remains
a major research question. Recently, it was shown in [20] that in the vision domain, perceptual
features mostly reside in the data subspace which explains a relatively small portion of the observed
variance. This suggests that reconstruction losses are sub-optimal for perception tasks since they tend
to prioritize learning subspaces that explain the bulk of the input variance. On the other hand, the
JEPA approach appears to be more suitable for perception tasks: empirically, JEPA often achieves
better downstream classification performance with fewer optimization steps [3, 19]."
INTRODUCTION,0.019635343618513323,"In this work, we seek to uncover the mechanisms behind these observations by analyzing tractable
deep linear neural networks. To that end, we introduce a fully solvable toy model admitting a
complete characterization of its training dynamics for both objectives. Our analysis is inspired by
previous work on the greedy learning dynamics of gradient descent, and SSL in particular [21, 22, 23].
However, going beyond previous work, here we present a more nuanced analysis showing how the
greedy nature of learning is affected by the choice of objective, model, and the properties of the data.
Our analysis reveals a distinct implicit bias of JEPAs: the propensity of the JEPA objective towards
learning influential features, defined as features with a large regression coefficient, a property for
which the MAE objective is mostly agnostic. Moreover, we show that this distinct bias takes hold
only when the encoder is deep and diminishes substantially when the encoder is shallow. This allows
JEPAs to steer away from the top subspace of the data which explains its observed variance, and
focus on the more semantically rich subspace. Our work therefore uncovers a fundamental implicit
bias, shedding light on both the advantages and drawbacks of predicting in latent space."
INTRODUCTION,0.021037868162692847,"To summarize, our specific contributions are:"
INTRODUCTION,0.02244039270687237,"1. We analytically solve the learning dynamics of JEPA and MAE, in the tractable theoretical
setting of deep linear networks.
2. In this setting, we prove a significant difference between JEPA and MAE: informally,
JEPA prioritizes “influential features” (features which are most informative in prediction),
whereas MAE only prioritizes highly covarying features (even if they are noisy and thus
less informative).
3. We show that our theoretical setting is rich enough to capture two more realistic generative
processes, based on static and dynamic linear models."

The Implicit Bias of JEPA"
THE IMPLICIT BIAS OF JEPA,0.04488078541374474,"Before presenting the theoretical results, we describe a simple experiment using the setup in section 1
which will flesh out a surprising key difference between the JEPA and MAE objectives in eq. (5)."
THE IMPLICIT BIAS OF JEPA,0.04628330995792426,"First, note that each coordinate xi of the input data represents an independent feature characterized by
the covariance and regression coefficient λi, ρi, which we refer to as feature parameters. Let ei ∈Rd
denote the i-th standard basis vector. We say that an encoder ¯W has learned the i-th feature if its
projection on ei, namely ∥¯Wei∥is large. Intuitively, one should expect that if ρi is small, ∥¯Wei∥
should be small post training as well. Note that this should not be overly surprising since, at least
in the case of the MAE objective, the global minimizer is achieved with the regression coefficients
V ¯W = Σyx(Σxx)−1. In this investigation, however, we seek an understanding of the dynamics of
training, by studying how the MAE and JEPA objectives prioritize different features in training, based
on their feature parameters."
THE IMPLICIT BIAS OF JEPA,0.047685834502103785,"To this end, we track how the projections ∥¯Wei∥evolve during training for each component i by
training models on Gaussian data with feature parameters λi, ρi according to the following two
distributions (see Figure 1(a) and (d) for an illustration):"
THE IMPLICIT BIAS OF JEPA,0.04908835904628331,"1. Distribution 1: Set both {λi}, {ρi} to be monotonically increasing (i.e ∀i>j, λi > λj, ρi >
ρj).
2. Distribution 2: Set {λi} to be monotonically increasing, and {ρi} to be monotonically
decreasing."
THE IMPLICIT BIAS OF JEPA,0.05049088359046283,"For each distribution, we initialize all the weights with a Gaussian initialization and train the models
using both the MAE and JEPA objectives using gradient descent on batches of randomly sampled data.
We illustrate the dynamics of training by measuring the magnitude of the encoder components ∥¯Wei∥
during training in Figure 1. On the first distribution, we observe clear greedy learning dynamics
for both objectives, where components with a higher λi are learned earlier on in training. This
behavior in greedy settings is in line with the findings in [21] which showed the same behavior in
similar settings. However, on the second distribution, we observe a distinction: while the MAE
objective retains its order of learning as in distribution 1, the JEPA objective exhibits a complete
inversion of the learning order where features with a higher ρi, rather than a high λi are learned first.
This implies that in practical scenarios with a finite training budget, JEPA and MAE objectives can
potentially learn entirely different features with little to no overlap, as illustrated in Figure 1. To
better understand these phenomena, we turn to a dynamical analysis of a simple model that fully
recovers our observations."

us to characterize the learning dynamics fully, we will show via numerical simulations (see section 4),
that the observations made in this paper will not change qualitatively under the more general and
realistic initialization. Since ODEs for each component i decouple, for the remainder of this paper,
we drop the subscript i and consider a single ODE for ¯w parameterized by the encoder and data
feature parameters {λ, ρ}. A direct corollary to theorem 3.2 is that the training dynamics of MAE
for L >> 1 as described in eq. (8) approach those of JEPA in eq. (7) for L = 1. Additionally, a
depth-dependent difference is apparent in the fixed-point solutions between the two objectives. This
is formalized in the following corollary:

reachable by the MAE objective, and vice versa. While interesting in itself, the difference between
the two objectives runs deeper than their fixed-point solutions and is found by analyzing the training
dynamics.
In the small initialization regime, the evolution of the weights during training for both objectives
exhibits incremental learning dynamics, in which the encoder learns features progressively. We
define the critical time, denoted as t∗, to be the time it takes for the encoder projection ¯w to reach a

Comparing Learning Dynamics: JEPA vs. MAE"

how each objective prioritizes features, we note the functional form of the leading orders in ϵ in the
critical time t⋆. For MAE, we observe that the leading order term depends principally on the inverse
of λ. Crucially, we note that the next to leading order term (NLO) is small in comparison for any
encoder depth L. This implies step-wise learning dynamics where the step ordering is predominantly
set by the feature covariance λ. Conversely, features with identical λ will be learned in the same"

of λ, however, the NLO term, which depends inversely on the regression coefficient ρ, is increasingly
large with the encoder depth L. That is, features with identical λ but with different ρ will be learned in
different timescales, where the feature with the highest regression coefficient is prioritized. Moreover,
the priority towards large ρ increases with depth. This implies a meaningful and distinct implicit bias

Numerical Experiments"
NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS,0.11640953716690042,"We also conduct experiments directly verifying our theoretical findings. To that end, we numerically
simulate the ODEs in eqs. (7) and (8) for different distributions and depths starting from a small
initialization. In Figure 2, we fix the encoder depth L = 5 while varying the data parameters. As
predicted by the theory, we observe a clear greedy learning process for both objectives. However,
only the JEPA objective exhibits greedy dynamics with respect to ρ, where components with larger ρ
are learned first. Moreover, we observe that the JEPA objective can reverse the feature learning order
relative to MAE when ρ and λ have the opposite trends, qualitatively reproducing the observation in
section 2. In Figure 4, we run further simulations by varying the depth parameter L. As predicted,
we observe that deeper encoders introduce a wider temporal spread between learning features with
the same λ but different ρ, in contrast to MAE which learns all features at the same time independent
of the depth. Moving beyond gradient flow and the assumptions on initialization, in Figure 5 we
train randomly initialized deep linear neural networks using stochastic gradient descent on randomly
sampled batches of Gaussian data with varying values for ρ, λ, using both objectives. As is evident,
our results carry over to this setup as well, where greedy learning of features can be seen with an
objective dependent ordering according to ρ, λ."

differences between JEPAs and MAEs for two settings: random masking and a temporal model. The
full details of these different settings can be found in Appendix C. In the first case, our views are
random masks of the data, this corresponds to a static setting and we derive closed-form expressions
for λ and ρ (see C.1). For the remainder of this section, we will focus in on the temporal model due
to its simplicity and intuitive interpretation."

two consecutive times: x = zt and y = zt+1. The goal is to predict the next frame from the previous
one (this setting is consistent with comparing VideoMAE and V-JEPA video models). We now define
a simple linear model corresponding to combining independently time-varying images {va} to the
model simultaneously with random noise. We can write this mathematically as:"

Related Work"
RELATED WORK,0.1332398316970547,"Self-supervised learning. One successful SSL paradigm is MAE [8] and its variants [13, 14] which
learn representations via input space reconstruction. However, recent works (e.g., [20]) show that
such generative paradigms often learn uninformative features for perception, since MAE-like methods
tend to learn the data subspace that explains the bulk of observed variance and can include unhelpful
information for perception. By contrast, the JEPA paradigm [9, 10, 11, 18, 19] learns to predict
the representations of similar image views in the latent space. Such objectives have been found
to prioritize semantic features over detailed pixel information, leading to superior performance for
perception tasks. To prevent the feature collapse of JEPA, stop-gradients, and other architectural tricks
are widely used. More recent works propose techniques like spectrum modulation [29] and weight
regularization [30]. Another popular collapse prevention method is based on contrastive loss against
negative image pairs [2, 5, 6, 11, 7]. In this work, we focus on MAE and JEPA methods, seeking to
understand their implicit bias that leads to different training dynamics. To measure representation
quality in JEPAs, [31] devised a metric that effectively counts the number of directions with a large
regression coefficient in latent space. Our work can be seen as further motivation for this approach."
RELATED WORK,0.13464235624123422,"Theoretical analysis of SSL. There have been several recent works attempting to understand the
success of non-contrastive SSL (JEPA) from various perspectives. [32] studies how the self-distillation
in JEPA avoids representation collapse, finding the key role of eigenspace alignment between the
predictor and input correlation matrix. The authors of [33] further provide a theoretical bridge
between contrastive and non-contrastive objectives towards global and local spectral embedding
methods respectively. It is shown that all these methods can be deployed successfully if the pairwise
relations during SSL are aligned with the downstream task. While for MAE-based methods, [20]
shows they tend to learn uninformative features by pixel reconstruction, unlike the JEPA objective
that prioritizes semantic features. In this paper, we seek to understand the mechanism behind this
empirical observation by characterizing the implicit bias of both methods using deep linear models."
RELATED WORK,0.13604488078541374,"Learning dynamics in linear networks. Deep linear neural networks have been used in [24, 25, 26,
27, 34, 28, 35, 36] to study the nonlinear dynamics of learning in various settings applying different
assumptions, including the saddle point behavior as well as the step-wise behavior where distinct
features are learned at different time scales. This is also in line with the observed greedy learning
dynamics for modern architectures like Transformers [22, 23]. In the context of SSL, the authors
of [21] observed a similar step-wise nature which corresponds to the learning of eigenmodes of
the contrastive kernel Σyx + Σxy. However, we go beyond this observation by characterizing the
distinctive implicit bias of JEPA relative to MAE, i.e., they learn the same features in a step-wise
fashion but not necessarily in the same order. Surprisingly, this difference in behavior is only apparent
when the encoder network is deep. Our findings about JEPA are related to empirical observations in
[37] which show JEPA-based methods focus on ”slow features” that vary slowly over time. This is
confirmed in our studies where JEPA-based methods will prioritize “slow features” for which the
marginal distribution has the smallest variance."
LIMITATIONS,0.13744740532959326,"6
Limitations"
LIMITATIONS,0.1388499298737728,"Our theory has several clear limitations. The theoretical results presented in this paper are restricted
to conditions in assumption 3.1, which include a deep linear MLP with some restrictions on the
initialization scheme, as well as a simultaneously diagonalizable covariances Σyx, Σxx. It is worth
discussing the implications of these assumptions, and the generalizability of our results to more
typical settings. On the model side, empirical simulations with deep linear models initialized using the
default initialization [38] indicate our results qualitatively generalize to popular initialization schemes.
However, a potentially stronger assumption we make is simultaneously diagonalizability of Σyx and
Σxx, which allows JEPA and MAE to learn the same features. We provide generative frameworks
that adhere to this property, however we expect data distributions of interest to significantly deviate
from this assumption. Moreover, the generalizability of our claims to fully practical scenarios yet
remains unexplored, and precise characterization of the implicit biases pertaining to more general
data distributions and architectures is a direction for future work."
DISCUSSION,0.1402524544179523,"7
Discussion"
DISCUSSION,0.14165497896213183,"We have introduced toy models of two of the most popular self-supervised algorithms, namely JEPA
and MAE, where we can completely characterize the learning process. We have uncovered a novel
learning principle that separates the two objectives: while MAE focuses on highly co-varying features
early in training, the JEPA objective focuses on highly influential features (indicated by high values of
the regression coefficient). This implicit bias of the JEPA objective allows it to focus on features that
are predictive, yet contain minimal noise, as measured by their variance across the training set. This
new understanding of the learning dynamics of JEPA sheds light on recent empirical observations
and opens the door to new avenues of research strengthening these results. Certainly, one must first
generalize these results to non-simultaneously-diagonalizable data distributions, as well as the more
imposing challenge of non-linear models. Still, a less than rigorous leap to practical settings may
still provide valuable insights. For example, an implicit bias towards predictive yet low-variance
features may explain the tendency of JEPA to learn more semantic features, which are inherently less
noisy. Conversely, it may shed light on JEPAs vulnerability to spurious or slow features. Additionally,
the feature prioritization distinction between the objectives may bear on the efficiency of JEPA in
learning semantic features quickly, as these features tend to reside in the low variance subspace of the
data, as shown recently [20]. Finally, it is also worth investigating whether the mechanism uncovered
here generalizes to other joint embedding architectures not relying on self-distillation."

Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.211781206171108,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ”Limitations” section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code"
CLAIMS,0.22019635343618513,"Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?"
CLAIMS,0.22159887798036465,Answer: [No]
CLAIMS,0.22300140252454417,"Justification: The major contributions of the paper are theoretical in nature. The experiments
included in the paper are used to support and illustrate analytical results. Consequently, the
models used are simple linear models trained with synthetic data. The paper describes how
to generate data used in the experiments as well as other setup information needed to run
and reproduce experiments.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.2244039270687237,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details"
CLAIMS,0.22580645161290322,"Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper specifies all details used to construct datasets used for training.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.22720897615708274,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance"
CLAIMS,0.22861150070126227,"Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Our experiments are used to verify predictions made by the analytical model
developed in the paper. The theory developed in this paper suggests strong effects that we
illustrate via experiments. These effects are strong and do not require making fine-grained
comparisons via statistical significance testing.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.2300140252454418,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ”Yes” if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper."
CLAIMS,0.2314165497896213,"• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources"
CLAIMS,0.23281907433380084,"Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This information is included with experimental details.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.23422159887798036,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics"
CLAIMS,0.23562412342215988,"Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We confirm that the work presented in this paper is performed in a manner
consistent with NeurIPS Ethics Guidelines.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.2370266479663394,"• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts"
CLAIMS,0.23842917251051893,"Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the broader impact of our research in Appendix E.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.23983169705469845,• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
CLAIMS,0.24123422159887797,"• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards"
CLAIMS,0.2426367461430575,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work is theoretical in nature so this question is not applicable.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.24403927068723702,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets"
CLAIMS,0.24544179523141654,"Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include this information in experimental details.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.24684431977559607,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided."
CLAIMS,0.2482468443197756,"• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets"
CLAIMS,0.2496493688639551,"Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.25105189340813466,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects"
CLAIMS,0.25245441795231416,"Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.2538569424964937,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.2552594670406732,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper."
CLAIMS,0.25666199158485276,"• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review."

the masking function and copy all other hyperparameters described in I-JEPA [3] and MAE [8].
We build additional datasets by removing certain principal components of the full data subspace as
described in [20] — bottom refers to the dataset that preservers bottom 25% of explained variance
while top denotes the dataset with top 75% of explained variance. We use the original (full) images
as well the filtered images described above and extract representations using encoders trained with I-
JEPA and MAE. We then compare the representation between full-bottom and full-top via canonical
correlation analysis (CCA) [41] for several checkpoints that are gathered during training."

that I-JEPA’s features obtained from the full and bottom datasets show higher similarity

that JEPA learns features from the bottom portion of the PCA space faster than MAE. Balestrieo and
Lecun [20] suggest that the bottom portion of the spectrum contain features useful for discrimination
tasks which is what JEPA focuses on during optimization."
