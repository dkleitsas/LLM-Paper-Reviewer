ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.008620689655172414,"A genetic algorithm is suitable for exploring large search spaces as it ﬁnds an ap-
proximate solution. Because of this advantage, genetic algorithm is effective in
exploring vast and unknown space such as molecular search space. Though the
algorithm is suitable for searching vast chemical space, it is difﬁcult to optimize
pharmacological properties while maintaining molecular substructure. To solve
this issue, we introduce a genetic algorithm featuring a constrained molecular in-
verse design. The proposed algorithm successfully produces valid molecules for
crossover and mutation. Furthermore, it optimizes speciﬁc properties while adher-
ing to structural constraints using a two-phase optimization. Experiments prove
that our algorithm effectively ﬁnds molecules that satisfy speciﬁc properties while
maintaining structural constraints."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.02586206896551724,"When the search space is complex or partially known, it is difﬁcult to optimize current solutions
using gradient descent (Jin & Ha, 1997; Ahmad et al., 2010). Because genetic algorithms ﬁnd ap-
proximate solutions, they are effective in exploring vast unknown space such as molecular search
space. (Holland, 1992; Jin & Ha, 1997; Ahmad et al., 2010; Henault et al., 2020). In drug discovery,
optimizing complex pharmacological properties using genetic algorithms have been widely studied
and extended (Leardi, 2001)."
INTRODUCTION,0.034482758620689655,"Deep learning-based molecular design is being actively conducted to improve pharmacological
properties and has served as a powerful tool (G´omez-Bombarelli et al., 2018). However, in-
ferred drug candidates depending on the architecture did not satisfy the heuristic guidelines set
by chemical researchers (George & Hautier, 2020). Furthermore, this not only produces non-
synthesizable molecules but also causes optimization problems for non-linear structure-activity re-
lationships (G´omez-Bombarelli et al., 2018; Vanhaelen et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.04310344827586207,"Most molecular design methods ﬁrst generate molecular structures and then calculate properties of
the structures resulting in high computational cost (Duvenaud et al., 2015; Gilmer et al., 2017; Fein-
berg et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019). Conversely, inverse molecular design speciﬁes target properties
in advance and then systematically explores the chemical space to discover molecular structures that
have the desired properties (Sanchez-Lengeling & Aspuru-Guzik, 2018)."
INTRODUCTION,0.05172413793103448,"Recent advances in molecular inverse design of genetic algorithms compete with or even surpass
deep learning-based methods (Yoshikawa et al., 2018; Jensen, 2019; Nigam et al., 2019; Polishchuk,
2020; Ahn et al., 2020; Nigam et al., 2021b;a). This indicates that the computational methods of ge-
netic algorithms in a chemical domain are more effective for exploring the vast chemical space (Ahn
et al., 2020). However, the genetic operators cause difﬁculty in lead optimization where the molec-
ular structure is constrained (Hasanc¸ebi & Erbatur, 2000)."
INTRODUCTION,0.0603448275862069,"A common molecular design strategy is to narrow the chemical search space, starting with known
potential molecules (Lim et al., 2020). The scaffold, which is the ”core” of the molecule is inten-
tionally maintained to preserve basic bioactivity (Hu et al., 2016). This is directly involved in the
interaction with the target protein (Zhao & Dietrich, 2015; Lim et al., 2020). In lead identiﬁcation
process, scaffolds with biological activity to the target protein are identiﬁed (Zhao & Dietrich, 2015).
In lead optimization process, it is important to optimize the SAR(Structure-Activity Relationship)
properties while staying in the chemical space associated with the privileged scaffold (Langevin"

INTRODUCTION,0.07758620689655173,"et al., 2020). Lead optimization can be described as a multiple optimization problem in scaffold
constraints (Langevin et al., 2020). Most studies have focused on the application of generative mod-
els to the ﬁeld of medicinal chemistry, and studies related to structure-constrained lead optimization
have not been extensively explored."
INTRODUCTION,0.08620689655172414,"In this regard, we introduce a genetic algorithm featuring constrained molecular inverse design. We
use graph and SELFIES descriptors to generate valid molecules through a two-phase GA-based
pipeline. In addition, we introduced a two-phase optimization to ensure that molecular generation
does not fail to optimize for speciﬁc properties while adhering to structural constraints."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.10344827586206896,"Among the various methods for constrained optimization in a genetic algorithm, the basic one is de-
signing effective penalty functions (Yeniay, 2005). The functions, which impose a penalty to ﬁtness
value, are widely used for constrained optimization (Yeniay, 2005; Fletcher, 2013). The individual
ﬁtness value is determined by combining the objective function value with the constraint violation
penalty. A dominant relationship exists between the constraint penalty and the objective function
value (Coello, 2000)."
RELATED WORK,0.11206896551724138,"One of the various methods is focusing on the selection of practicable solutions. To solve the prob-
lem of constrained optimization using a genetic algorithm, a two-phase framework which is Multi-
Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) was introduced (Venkatraman & Yen, 2005). In the ﬁrst
phase, MoEA conﬁrms the constraint satisfaction of solutions using a penalty function. The algo-
rithm ranks solutions based on violations of constraints, completely disregarding objective function.
When one or more feasible solutions are identiﬁed, the second phase continues. In the second phase,
individual ﬁtness is reassigned according to the objective function-constraint violation space and
bi-objective optimization is performed (Venkatraman & Yen, 2005)."
RELATED WORK,0.1206896551724138,"Structure-constrained molecular optimization work was ﬁrst presented in the JT-VAE (Jin et al.,
2018a) study. In this study, they create a tree-structured scaffold for constraining the structure of a
molecule and then generate a molecular graph using a message-passing network (Jin et al., 2018a).
GCPN (You et al., 2018) uses goal-directed reinforcement learning to generate molecules with de-
sired properties and similarities. VJTNN (Jin et al., 2018b) treated molecular optimization as a
graph-to-graph translation problem and solved it through MMPA(Matched Molecular Pair Anal-
ysis) (Dalke et al., 2018) dataset. DEFactor (Assouel et al., 2018) generated molecules with op-
timized penalized LogP while maintaining molecular similarity through differentiable conditional
probability-based graph VAE."
RELATED WORK,0.12931034482758622,"Glen & Payne proposed a method for generating molecules through domain-speciﬁc rule-based
crossover and mutation to ensure molecular structure constraints (Glen & Payne, 1995). To produce
offspring molecules with the parent’s substructures, the crossover is used as a strategy to cut the
end part of the molecule and link it to the end part of another similar molecule. To produce new
molecules, twelve operators of mutation were deﬁned: atomic insertion, atomic deletion, etc (Glen
& Payne, 1995)."
RELATED WORK,0.13793103448275862,"ChemGE (Yoshikawa et al., 2018) uses the grammatical evolution of SMILES (Simpliﬁed
Molecular-Input Line-Entry System) (Weininger, 1988) to optimize penalized LogP and KITH pro-
tein inhibitors. Their study converts SMILES into integer sequences using a chromosomal mapping
process (Yoshikawa et al., 2018). Subsequently, operators of mutation are used to optimize gram-
matical evolutionary molecular populations. GA-GB (Jensen, 2019) and MolFinder (Kwon & Lee,
2021) deﬁned expert rules for operators of crossover and mutation to ensure the validity of the struc-
ture when generating molecules. GEGL (Ahn et al., 2020) created optimized SMILES strings for
penalized LogP by presenting a reinforcement learning contained expert policy."
RELATED WORK,0.14655172413793102,"Various studies have proposed SMILES-based approaches since they are convenient to convert a
complex 3D chemical structure to a simple 1D string (Yoshikawa et al., 2018; Kwon & Lee, 2021;
Ahn et al., 2020). However, adding atoms or square brackets to a string indeed changes the structure
globally not locally (Dalke, 2018). It is difﬁcult to generate a completely valid molecule because
SMILES are context sensitive (Dalke, 2018; Kwon & Lee, 2021). Recently, the development and
application of SELFIES(Self-Referencing Embedded Strings), which is a 100% valid string repre-
sentation, has been implemented in the molecular inverse design to cope with this problem (Krenn"

RELATED WORK,0.16379310344827586,"et al., 2020). The GA-D (Nigam et al., 2019) generated SELFIES strings using a random operator of
mutation while maintaining validity. Furthermore, this study maintained the molecular diversity of
the population through an adaptive penalty of the deep neural discriminator (Nigam et al., 2019). The
STONED (Nigam et al., 2021b) study was introduced for performing local chemical space search
and molecular interpolation using SELFIES. Furthermore, the mutation site was limited to terminal
10% to maintain the molecular scaffold (Nigam et al., 2021b). SELFIES makes it possible to gen-
erate new molecules through the random operation without relying on expert rules in operations of
mutation (Nigam et al., 2021b)."

PROPOSED METHOD"
PROPOSED METHOD,0.1810344827586207,"In this section, we introduce a novel genetic algorithm for constrained optimization in molecular
inverse design. Our algorithm generates molecules suitable for the target properties while constrain-
ing the structural similarity of a target molecule. We use two strategies to satisfy the constraint
conditions. First, our algorithm constructs a population that always satisﬁes the structural similarity
condition in the ﬁrst phase. Second, the algorithm selects the appropriate molecular descriptors ac-
cording to the genetic operators to ensure the validity of the molecule. The detailed whole process
is shown in ﬁgure 1."
PROPOSED METHOD,0.1896551724137931,Figure 1: Illustration of genetic algorithm process for constrained optimization
PROPOSED METHOD,0.19827586206896552,"The algorithm starts by constructing a population depending on whether the target molecule or
similar molecules exist in the dataset. In the case of the target molecule or its similar molecule
existing in the dataset, the population consists of molecules above the similarity calculated by the
similarity between the molecules in the dataset and the target molecule. On the contrary, a target
molecular SMILES is randomly arranged to construct a population according to the population size."
PROPOSED METHOD,0.20689655172413793,"Next, our algorithm conﬁrms constraint satisfaction from the population and proceeds with bi-
optimization for property and constraint conditions. The detailed process is explained in the sub-
sections below."

TWO-PHASE MOLECULAR OPTIMIZATION"
TWO-PHASE MOLECULAR OPTIMIZATION,0.23275862068965517,"In the work of constrained molecular optimization, the optimization often failed when a large num-
ber of molecules were subject to penalty included in the population. Therefore, we focused on en-
suring that the population always contains only feasible solutions. Inspired by MOEA (Venkatraman
& Yen, 2005), we divided the process into constraint satisfaction and bi-optimization, each of which
is further explained in the following."
TWO-PHASE MOLECULAR OPTIMIZATION,0.2413793103448276,"Constraint Satisfaction for Population
In this phase, the algorithm searches for feasible solu-
tions considering only the structural similarity. The objective function is not considered in this
process. The algorithm measures the Tanimoto coefﬁcient of how similar it is to the reference
molecule(Nigam et al., 2019). The similarity between the target molecule m and the product
molecule m′ is expressed as sim(m, m′). SimilarityPenalty(m) is given to each molecule ac-
cording to as follows:"
TWO-PHASE MOLECULAR OPTIMIZATION,0.25,SimilarityPenalty(m) =

0, sim(m, m′) ≥δ
−106, sim(m, m′) < δ
(1)"
TWO-PHASE MOLECULAR OPTIMIZATION,0.2672413793103448,"SimilarityPenalty(m) is set to 0 if sim(m, m′) ≥δ (Nigam et al., 2019). Otherwise, a death
penalty of −106 is given. Next, the algorithm assigns ﬁtness value to each individual by equation 2
and selects only feasible solutions. A ﬁtness function is expressed as follows:"
TWO-PHASE MOLECULAR OPTIMIZATION,0.27586206896551724,"F(m) = SimilarityPenalty(m)
(2)"
TWO-PHASE MOLECULAR OPTIMIZATION,0.28448275862068967,"Bi-Optimization for Property and Constraint Condition
In this phase, the algorithm switches
to bi-optimization for the ﬁtness function value and the constraint condition when one or more
feasible solutions are found. Our work simultaneously is to maximize the penalized LogP value
while retaining the molecular structure. The penalized LogP (J(m)) of each molecule is expressed
as follows:
J(m) = LopP(m) −SAScore(m) −RingPenalty(m)
(3)"
TWO-PHASE MOLECULAR OPTIMIZATION,0.29310344827586204,"The higher score for J(m) has a more suitable structural proﬁle as a drug (Yoshikawa et al., 2018).
LogP(m) is the octanol-water partition coefﬁcient for the molecule m. SAScore(m) is the Syn-
thetic Accessibility score, which is a quantitative score for whether a molecular structure can be
synthesized (Ertl & Schuffenhauer, 2009). The higher the score, the more difﬁcult it is to synthesize
molecules. By giving a penalty according to the score, it is possible to prevent the generation of
molecules that cannot be synthesized. RingPenalty(m) is used to give a penalty to prevent the cre-
ation of molecules with unrealistically many carbon rings. This function is a penalty for molecules
with seven or more rings of carbon (Yoshikawa et al., 2018)."
TWO-PHASE MOLECULAR OPTIMIZATION,0.3017241379310345,"The algorithm reassigns the ﬁtness value to each individual according to equation 4 and sorted by
rank. A ﬁtness function can be represented as follows:"

TWO-PHASE MOLECULAR OPTIMIZATION,0.31896551724137934,"We wanted not only to preserve the superior individuals but also to replace the inferior individuals
through reproduction. A portion of the generated molecules are replaced while the rest of the are
kept through the selection module. The probability of replacing a molecule is determined using a
smooth logistic function based on a ranking of ﬁtness (Nigam et al., 2019)."

GENETIC OPERATORS,0.33620689655172414,"In chemistry, expert rules are required to create valid molecules through the operation of crossover

GENETIC OPERATORS,0.35344827586206895,"Crossover
Performing one-point crossover on a string is faster than the operation of a graph.
However, arbitrarily cutting strings does not take the molecular structure into account. We used an
operator of graph-based crossover presented in GB-GA (Jensen, 2019) Considering the structure,
our algorithm distinguishes between cutting and not cutting rings. There are two types of cutting
methods considering the molecular structure: non-ring cut and ring cut. The probabilities are all the
same in both cases."
GENETIC OPERATORS,0.3620689655172414,"An operation of the crossover is used to maintain a diversity of individuals. This operation ﬁrst
selects two-parent molecules from the population randomly. Next, it performs a ring crossover or
non-ring crossover according to a set probability. The bonding of fragmented molecules proceeds
according to the rules of reaction. It generates a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 4 new offspring
molecules through an operation of crossover. To maintain the population, only one is randomly
selected from the produced offspring molecules."
GENETIC OPERATORS,0.3706896551724138,"Mutation
An operation of mutation uses the SELFIES (Krenn et al., 2020) strings, which can pro-
duce 100% valid molecules with string conversion without special rules. The SELFIES strings can
maintain the validity of the molecule even when a random point operation of mutation is performed
in STONED (Nigam et al., 2021b). Therefore, we performed a one-point mutation using SELFIES
which is lighter and more efﬁcient than graph-based. There are three types of one-point mutation
to maintain a diversity of individuals: atom replacement, atom insert, and atom deletion. The prob-
abilities are all the same in all three kinds of cases. Although the SELFIES strings produce valid
molecules, we wanted the mutation to act as bioisosteric replacements. We restricted the range of
the operation of mutation to the terminal 10% (Nigam et al., 2021b). When a mutation is performed,
the speciﬁed probability determines which operator of a mutation to perform. The position of the
point is randomly determined within the speciﬁed range, and then the corresponding operation is
performed."

existing drugs (Besnard et al., 2012; Lim et al., 2020). For comparison with other baseline models,
the molecular generation size was limited to 81 SMILES lengths. This is because the value of LogP
varies depending on the number and type of atoms, and a good score can be obtained by increasing
the molecular size to make it arbitrarily large (Jensen, 2019). δ is 0.4 or 0.6 which is the Tani-
moto similarity threshold. For each molecule, the maximization was performed for 20 generations
to measure the greatest. The improvement measurement results are shown in Table 1."

CONCLUSION,0.5517241379310345,"In this work, we demonstrated a molecular inverse design that maximizes penalized LogP while
constraining the molecular structure. The proposed method constructs a solution set in which the
molecular population always satisﬁes the structural similarity through two-phase optimization. To
generate valid molecules, we used to graph and SELFIES molecular descriptors. Our algorithm ef-
fectively generated optimized molecules while maintaining structural similarity to target molecules.
Experiment shows that excels over the state of arts model. In cannabidiol molecular optimization,
our model is able to maintain the molecular core and optimize target properties over generations."
CONCLUSION,0.5603448275862069,"It is very important to design new molecules and materials with speciﬁc structures and functions.
In light of our experimental results, optimizing only penalized LogP may not take the diversity of
molecular functional groups into account when binding to protein targets. In this regard, we need
an extension method that can consider various properties at the same time. Our algorithm uses a
docking module to enable inverse molecular design with enhanced binding afﬁnity for biological
targets. Moreover, it is expected to be used in design peptides or proteins with the desired function."
