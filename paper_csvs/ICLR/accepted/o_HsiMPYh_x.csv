ABSTRACT,0.0016722408026755853,"Real-world machine learning deployments are characterized by mismatches be-
tween the source (training) and target (test) distributions that may cause perfor-
mance drops. In this work, we investigate methods for predicting the target domain
accuracy using only labeled source data and unlabeled target data. We propose Av-
erage Thresholded Conﬁdence (ATC), a practical method that learns a threshold on
the model’s conﬁdence, predicting accuracy as the fraction of unlabeled examples
for which model conﬁdence exceeds that threshold. ATC outperforms previous
methods across several model architectures, types of distribution shifts (e.g., due to
synthetic corruptions, dataset reproduction, or novel subpopulations), and datasets
(WILDS, ImageNet, BREEDS, CIFAR, and MNIST). In our experiments, ATC
estimates target performance 2–4ˆ more accurately than prior methods. We also
explore the theoretical foundations of the problem, proving that, in general, identi-
fying the accuracy is just as hard as identifying the optimal predictor and thus, the
efﬁcacy of any method rests upon (perhaps unstated) assumptions on the nature
of the shift. Finally, analyzing our method on some toy distributions, we provide
insights concerning when it works."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.005016722408026756,"Machine learning models deployed in the real world typically encounter examples from previously
unseen distributions. While the IID assumption enables us to evaluate models using held-out data
from the source distribution (from which training data is sampled), this estimate is no longer valid
in presence of a distribution shift. Moreover, under such shifts, model accuracy tends to degrade
(Szegedy et al., 2014; Recht et al., 2019; Koh et al., 2021). Commonly, the only data available to
the practitioner are a labeled training set (source) and unlabeled deployment-time data which makes
the problem more difﬁcult. In this setting, detecting shifts in the distribution of covariates is known
to be possible (but difﬁcult) in theory (Ramdas et al., 2015), and in practice (Rabanser et al., 2018).
However, producing an optimal predictor using only labeled source and unlabeled target data is
well-known to be impossible absent further assumptions (Ben-David et al., 2010; Lipton et al., 2018)."
INTRODUCTION,0.006688963210702341,"Two vital questions that remain are: (i) the precise conditions under which we can estimate a clas-
siﬁer’s target-domain accuracy; and (ii) which methods are most practically useful. To begin, the
straightforward way to assess the performance of a model under distribution shift would be to collect
labeled (target domain) examples and then to evaluate the model on that data. However, collect-
ing fresh labeled data from the target distribution is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming,
especially if the target distribution is non-stationary. Hence, instead of using labeled data, we aim
to use unlabeled data from the target distribution, that is comparatively abundant, to predict model
performance. Note that in this work, our focus is not to improve performance on the target but, rather,
to estimate the accuracy on the target for a given classiﬁer."

INTRODUCTION,0.011705685618729096,"Figure 1: Illustration of our proposed method ATC. Left: using source domain validation data, we
identify a threshold on a score (e.g. negative entropy) computed on model conﬁdence such that
fraction of examples above the threshold matches the validation set accuracy. ATC estimates accuracy
on unlabeled target data as the fraction of examples with the score above the threshold. Interestingly,
this threshold yields accurate estimates on a wide set of target distributions resulting from natural
and synthetic shifts. Right: Efﬁcacy of ATC over previously proposed approaches on our testbed
with a post-hoc calibrated model. To obtain errors on the same scale, we rescale all errors with
Average Conﬁdence (AC) error. Lower estimation error is better. See Table 1 for exact numbers and
comparison on various types of distribution shift. See Sec. 5 for details on our testbed."
INTRODUCTION,0.013377926421404682,"Recently, numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose (Deng & Zheng, 2021; Chen et al.,
2021; Jiang et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2021; Guillory et al., 2021). These methods either require
calibration on the target domain to yield consistent estimates (Jiang et al., 2021; Guillory et al.,
2021) or additional labeled data from several target domains to learn a linear regression function on a
distributional distance that then predicts model performance (Deng et al., 2021; Deng & Zheng, 2021;
Guillory et al., 2021). However, methods that require calibration on the target domain typically yield
poor estimates since deep models trained and calibrated on source data are not, in general, calibrated
on a (previously unseen) target domain (Ovadia et al., 2019). Besides, methods that leverage labeled
data from target domains rely on the fact that unseen target domains exhibit strong linear correlation
with seen target domains on the underlying distance measure and, hence, can be rendered ineffective
when such target domains with labeled data are unavailable (in Sec. 5.1 we demonstrate such a failure
on a real-world distribution shift problem). Therefore, throughout the paper, we assume access to
labeled source data and only unlabeled data from target domain(s)."
INTRODUCTION,0.015050167224080268,"In this work, we ﬁrst show that absent assumptions on the source classiﬁer or the nature of the shift,
no method of estimating accuracy will work generally (even in non-contrived settings). To estimate
accuracy on target domain perfectly, we highlight that even given perfect knowledge of the labeled
source distribution (i.e., pspx, yq) and unlabeled target distribution (i.e., ptpxq), we need restrictions
on the nature of the shift such that we can uniquely identify the target conditional ptpy|xq. Thus, in
general, identifying the accuracy of the classiﬁer is as hard as identifying the optimal predictor."
INTRODUCTION,0.016722408026755852,"Second, motivated by the superiority of methods that use maximum softmax probability (or logit) of
a model for Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016; Hendrycks et al.,
2019), we propose a simple method that leverages softmax probability to predict model performance.
Our method, Average Thresholded Conﬁdence (ATC), learns a threshold on a score (e.g., maximum
conﬁdence or negative entropy) of model conﬁdence on validation source data and predicts target
domain accuracy as the fraction of unlabeled target points that receive a score above that threshold.
ATC selects a threshold on validation source data such that the fraction of source examples that
receive the score above the threshold match the accuracy of those examples. Our primary contribution
in ATC is the proposal of obtaining the threshold and observing its efﬁcacy on (practical) accuracy
estimation. Importantly, our work takes a step forward in positively answering the question raised in
Deng & Zheng (2021); Deng et al. (2021) about a practical strategy to select a threshold that enables
accuracy prediction with thresholded model conﬁdence."

predicting target accuracy on a variety of distribution shifts. In particular, we consider shifts due
to common corruptions (e.g., ImageNet-C), natural distribution shifts due to dataset reproduction
(e.g., ImageNet-v2, ImageNet-R), shifts due to novel subpopulations (e.g., BREEDS), and distribution
shifts faced in the wild (e.g., WILDS)."

distribution shift with varying proportions of the population with spurious features, as in Nagarajan

evaluation, like all methods, it must fail (returns inconsistent estimates) on certain types of distribution
shifts, per our impossibility result."

PRIOR WORK"
PRIOR WORK,0.026755852842809364,"Out-of-distribution detection.
The main goal of OOD detection is to identify previously unseen
examples, i.e., samples out of the support of training distribution. To accomplish this, modern methods
utilize conﬁdence or features learned by a deep network trained on some source data. Hendrycks &
Gimpel (2016); Geifman & El-Yaniv (2017) used the conﬁdence score of an (already) trained deep
model to identify OOD points. Lakshminarayanan et al. (2016) use entropy of an ensemble model to
evaluate prediction uncertainty on OOD points. To improve OOD detection with model conﬁdence,
Liang et al. (2017) propose to use temperature scaling and input perturbations. Jiang et al. (2018)
propose to use scores based on the relative distance of the predicted class to the second class. Recently,
residual ﬂow-based methods were used to obtain a density model for OOD detection (Zhang et al.,
2020). Ji et al. (2021) proposed a method based on subfunction error bounds to compute unreliability
per sample. Refer to Ovadia et al. (2019); Ji et al. (2021) for an overview and comparison of methods
for prediction uncertainty on OOD data."
PRIOR WORK,0.028428093645484948,"Predicting model generalization.
Understanding generalization capabilities of overparameterized
models on in-distribution data using conventional machine learning tools has been a focus of a long
line of work; representative research includes Neyshabur et al. (2015; 2017); Neyshabur (2017);
Neyshabur et al. (2018); Dziugaite & Roy (2017); Bartlett et al. (2017); Zhou et al. (2018); Long
& Sedghi (2019); Nagarajan & Kolter (2019a). At a high level, this line of research bounds the
generalization gap directly with complexity measures calculated on the trained model. However, these
bounds typically remain numerically loose relative to the true generalization error (Zhang et al., 2016;
Nagarajan & Kolter, 2019b). On the other hand, another line of research departs from complexity-
based approaches to use unseen unlabeled data to predict in-distribution generalization (Platanios
et al., 2016; 2017; Garg et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2021)."
PRIOR WORK,0.030100334448160536,"Relevant to our work are methods for predicting the error of a classiﬁer on OOD data based on
unlabeled data from the target (OOD) domain. These methods can be characterized into two broad
categories: (i) Methods which explicitly predict correctness of the model on individual unlabeled
points (Deng & Zheng, 2021; Jiang et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2021); and (ii) Methods which directly
obtain an estimate of error with unlabeled OOD data without making a point-wise prediction (Chen
et al., 2021; Guillory et al., 2021; Chuang et al., 2020)."
PRIOR WORK,0.03177257525083612,"To achieve a consistent estimate of the target accuracy, Jiang et al. (2021); Guillory et al. (2021)
require calibration on target domain. However, these methods typically yield poor estimates as
deep models trained and calibrated on some source data are seldom calibrated on previously unseen
domains (Ovadia et al., 2019). Additionally, Deng & Zheng (2021); Guillory et al. (2021) derive
model-based distribution statistics on unlabeled target set that correlate with the target accuracy and
propose to use a subset of labeled target domains to learn a (linear) regression function that predicts
model performance. However, there are two drawbacks with this approach: (i) the correlation of
these distribution statistics can vary substantially as we consider different nature of shifts (refer to
Sec. 5.1, where we empirically demonstrate this failure); (ii) even if there exists a (hypothetical)
statistic with strong correlations, obtaining labeled target domains (even simulated ones) with strong
correlations would require signiﬁcant a priori knowledge about the nature of shift that, in general,
might not be available before models are deployed in the wild. Nonetheless, in our work, we only
assume access to labeled data from the source domain presuming no access to labeled target domains
or information about how to simulate them."

ACCURACY ESTIMATION: POSSIBILITY AND IMPOSSIBILITY RESULTS"
PROBLEM SETUP,0.046822742474916385,"First, we investigate the question of when it is possible to estimate the target accuracy of an arbitrary
classiﬁer, even given knowledge of the full source distribution pspx, yq and target marginal ptpxq.
Absent assumptions on the nature of shift, estimating target accuracy is impossible. Even given
access to pspx, yq and ptpxq, the problem is fundamentally unidentiﬁable because ptpy|xq can shift
arbitrarily. In the following proposition, we show that absent assumptions on the classiﬁer f (i.e.,
when f can be any classiﬁer in the space of all classiﬁers on X), we can estimate accuracy on the
target data iff assumptions on the nature of the shift, together with pspx, yq and ptpxq, uniquely
identify the (unknown) target conditional ptpy|xq. We relegate proofs from this section to App. A.
Proposition 1. Absent further assumptions, accuracy on the target is identiﬁable iff ptpy|xq is
uniquely identiﬁed given pspx, yq and ptpxq."
PROBLEM SETUP,0.048494983277591976,"Proposition 1 states that we need enough constraints on nature of shift such that pspx, yq and ptpxq
identiﬁes unique ptpy|xq. It also states that under some assumptions on the nature of the shift, we
can hope to estimate the model’s accuracy on target data. We will illustrate this on two common
assumptions made in domain adaptation literature: (i) covariate shift (Heckman, 1977; Shimodaira,
2000) and (ii) label shift (Saerens et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2013; Lipton et al., 2018). Under
covariate shift assumption, that the target marginal support supppptpxqq is a subset of the source
marginal support suppppspxqq and that the conditional distribution of labels given inputs does not
change within support, i.e., pspy|xq “ ptpy|xq, which, trivially, identiﬁes a unique target conditional
ptpy|xq. Under label shift, the reverse holds, i.e., the class-conditional distribution does not change
(pspx|yq “ ptpx|yq) and, again, information about ptpxq uniquely determines the target conditional
ptpy|xq (Lipton et al., 2018; Garg et al., 2020). In these settings, one can estimate an arbitrary
classiﬁer’s accuracy on the target domain either by using importance re-weighting with the ratio
ptpxq{pspxq in case of covariate shift or by using importance re-weighting with the ratio ptpyq{pspyq
in case of label shift. While importance ratios in the former case can be obtained directly when ptpxq
and pspxq are known, the importance ratios in the latter case can be obtained by using techniques
from Lipton et al. (2018); Azizzadenesheli et al. (2019); Alexandari et al. (2019)."

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.19732441471571907,"In this work, we proposed ATC, a simple method for estimating target domain accuracy based on
unlabeled target (and labeled source data). ATC achieves remarkably low estimation error on several
synthetic and natural shift benchmarks in our experiments. Notably, our work draws inspiration
from recent state-of-the-art methods that use softmax conﬁdences below a certain threshold for OOD
detection (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016; Hendrycks et al., 2019) and takes a step forward in answering
questions raised in Deng & Zheng (2021) about the practicality of threshold based methods."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.19899665551839466,"Our distribution shift toy model justiﬁes ATC on an easy-to-learn binary classiﬁcation task. In our
experiments, we also observe that calibration signiﬁcantly improves estimation with ATC. Since in
binary classiﬁcation, post hoc calibration with TS does not change the effective threshold, in future
work, we hope to extend our theoretical model to multi-class classiﬁcation to understand the efﬁcacy
of calibration. Our theory establishes that a classiﬁer’s accuracy is not, in general identiﬁed, from
labeled source and unlabeled target data alone, absent considerable additional constraints on the
target conditional ptpy|xq. In light of this ﬁnding, we also hope to extend our understanding beyond
the simple theoretical toy model to characterize broader sets of conditions under which ATC might
be guaranteed to obtain consistent estimates. Finally, we should note that while ATC outperforms
previous approaches, it still suffers from large estimation error on datasets with novel populations,
e.g., BREEDS. We hope that our ﬁndings can lay the groundwork for future work for improving
accuracy estimation on such datasets."

ALTERNATE INTERPRETATION OF ATC"
REFERENCES,0.44648829431438125,"Consider the following framework: Given a datum px, yq, deﬁne a binary classiﬁcation problem
of whether the model prediction arg max fpxq was correct or incorrect. In particular, if the model
prediction matches the true label, then we assign a label 1 (positive) and conversely, if the model
prediction doesn’t match the true label then we assign a label 0 (negative)."
REFERENCES,0.44816053511705684,"Our method can be interpreted as identifying examples for correct and incorrect prediction based
on the value of the score function spfpxqq, i.e., if the score spfpxqq is greater than or equal to
the threshold t then our method predicts that the classiﬁer correctly predicted datum px, yq and
vice-versa if the score is less than t. A method that can solve this task will perfectly estimate the
target performance. However, such an expectation is unrealistic. Instead, ATC expects that most of
the examples with score above threshold are correct and most of the examples below the threshold
are incorrect. More importantly, ATC selects a threshold such that the number of falsely identiﬁed
correct predictions match falsely identiﬁed incorrect predictions on source distribution, thereby
balancing incorrect predictions. We expect useful estimates of accuracy with ATC if the threshold
transfers to target, i.e. if the number of falsely identiﬁed correct predictions match falsely identiﬁed
incorrect predictions on target. This interpretation relates our method to the OOD detection literature
where Hendrycks & Gimpel (2016); Hendrycks et al. (2019) highlight that classiﬁers tend to assign
higher conﬁdence to in-distribution examples and leverage maximum softmax conﬁdence (or logit)
to perform OOD detection."

DETAILS ON THE TOY MODEL"

experiment. In the same setup, we empirically observe that the margin on population with less density
is large, i.e., margin is much greater than γ when the number of observed samples is small (in Fig. 4
(d)). Building on this observation, Nagarajan et al. (2020) showed in cases when margin decreases
with number of samples, a max margin classiﬁer trained on ﬁnite samples is bound to depend on the
spurious features in such cases. They referred to this skew as geometric skew."

Nagarajan et al. (2020) showed that training for ﬁnite number of epochs, a linear classiﬁer will have a
non zero dependency on the spurious feature. They referred to this skew as statistical skew. Due both
of these skews, we observe that a linear classiﬁer obtained with training for ﬁnite steps on training
data with ﬁnite samples, will have a non-zero dependency on the spurious feature. We refer interested

N,0.637123745819398,"ImageNet setup. First, we consider synthetic shifts induced to simulate 19 different visual corruptions
(e.g., shot noise, motion blur, pixelation etc.) each with 5 different intensities giving us a total of 95
datasets under ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019). Next, we consider natural distribution
shifts due to differences in the data collection process. In particular, we consider 3 ImageNetv2 (Recht
et al., 2019) datasets each using a different strategy to collect test sets. We also evaluate performance
on images with artistic renditions of object classes, i.e., ImageNet-R (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and
ImageNet-Sketch (Wang et al., 2019) with hand drawn sketch images. Note that renditions dataset
only contains 200 classes from ImageNet. Hence, in the main paper we include results on ImageNet
restricted to these 200 classes, which we call as ImageNet-200, and relegate results on ImageNet with
1k classes to appendix."
N,0.6387959866220736,"We also consider BREEDS benchmark (Santurkar et al., 2020) in our evaluation to assess robustness
to subpopulation shifts, in particular, to understand how accuracy estimation methods behave when
novel subpopulations not observed during training are introduced. BREEDS leverages class hierarchy
in ImageNet to repurpose original classes to be the subpopulations and deﬁnes a classiﬁcation task
on superclasses. Subpopulation shift is induced by directly making the subpopulations present
in the training and test distributions disjoint. Overall, BREEDS benchmark contains 4 datasets
ENTITY-13, ENTITY-30, LIVING-17, NON-LIVING-26, each focusing on different subtrees in the
hierarchy. To generate BREEDS dataset on top of ImageNet, we use the open source library: https:
//github.com/MadryLab/BREEDS-Benchmarks. We focus on natural and synthetic shifts
as in ImageNet on same and different subpopulations in BREEDs. Thus for both the subpopulation
(same or novel), we obtain a total of 99 target datasets."

et al., 2008)) due to differences in data collection strategy on on CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton,

N,0.6655518394648829,"ImageNet
For training, we use Adam with a batch size of 64 and learning rate 0.0001. Due to
huge size of ImageNet, we could only train two models needed for GDE for 10 epochs. Hence, for
relatively small scale experiments, we also perform experiments on ImageNet subset with 200 classes,
which we call as ImageNet-200 with the same training procedure. These 200 classes are the same
classes as in ImageNet-R dataset. This not only allows us to train ImageNet for 50 epochs but also
allows us to use ImageNet-R in our testbed. On the both the datasets, we observe a similar superioriy
with ATC. Note that all the models trained here were initialized with a pre-trained ImageNet model
with the last layer replaced with random weights."

problems, ATC-NE and ATC-MC can lead to different ordering of examples when ranked with
the corresponding scoring function. Temperature scaling on top can further alter the ordering of
examples. The changed ordering of examples yields different thresholds and different accuracy
estimates. However for binary classiﬁcation, the two scoring functions are the same as entropy
(i.e. p logppq ` p1 ´ pq logppq) has a one-to-one mapping to the max conf for p P r0, 1s. Moreover,
temperature scaling also doesn’t change the order of points for binary classiﬁcation problems. Hence
for the binary classiﬁcation problems, both the scoring functions with and without temperature scaling
yield the same estimates. We have made this clear in the updated draft."

the nature of shift. ‘Same’ refers to same subpopulation shifts and ‘Novel’ refers novel subpopulation
shifts. We include details about the target sets considered in each shift in Table 2. Post T denotes
use of TS calibration on source. For language datasets, we use DistilBERT-base-uncased, for vision
dataset we report results with DenseNet model with the exception of MNIST where we use FCN.
Across all datasets, we observe that ATC achieves superior performance (lower MAE is better). For
GDE post T and pre T estimates match since TS doesn’t alter the argmax prediction. Results reported
by aggregating MAE numbers over 4 different seeds. Values in parenthesis (i.e., p¨q) denote standard
deviation values."

N,0.9983277591973244,"Table 4: Mean Absolute estimation Error (MAE) results for different datasets in our setup grouped
by the nature of shift for ResNet model. ‘Same’ refers to same subpopulation shifts and ‘Novel’ refers
novel subpopulation shifts. We include details about the target sets considered in each shift in Table 2.
Post T denotes use of TS calibration on source. Across all datasets, we observe that ATC achieves
superior performance (lower MAE is better). For GDE post T and pre T estimates match since TS
doesn’t alter the argmax prediction. Results reported by aggregating MAE numbers over 4 different
seeds. Values in parenthesis (i.e., p¨q) denote standard deviation values."
