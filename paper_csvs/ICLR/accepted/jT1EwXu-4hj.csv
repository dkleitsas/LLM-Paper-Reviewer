ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0014184397163120568,"The interventional nature of recommendation has attracted increasing attention
in recent years. It particularly motivates researchers to formulate learning and
evaluating recommendation as causal inference and data missing-not-at-random
problems. However, few take seriously the consequence of violating the critical
assumption of overlapping, which we prove can significantly threaten the validity
and interpretation of the outcome. We find a critical piece missing in the current
understanding of information retrieval (IR) systems: as interventions, recommen-
dation not only affects the already observed data, but it also interferes with the
target domain (distribution) of interest. We then rephrase optimizing recommen-
dation as finding an intervention that best transports the patterns it learns from
the observed domain to its intervention domain. Towards this end, we use do-
main transportation to characterize the learning-intervention mechanism of rec-
ommendation. We design a principled transportation-constraint risk minimization
objective and convert it to a two-player minimax game. We prove the consistency,
generalization, and excessive risk bounds for the proposed objective, and elaborate
how they compare to the current results. Finally, we carry out extensive real-data
and semi-synthetic experiments to demonstrate the advantage of our approach,
and launch online testing with a real-world IR system."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.00425531914893617,"For information retrieval (IR) systems, the users’ willingness to interact is often intervened by the
content we show. Recommendations not only impact the potential response of the users, but also
change the nature of the data collected for training machine learning models (Bottou et al., 2013).
The interventional nature of recommendation, as well as the fact that many questions in IR are
counterfactual, e.g., ”what the response would have been if we recommended something else”,
makes it natural to rephrase recommendation in the context of causal inference or missing data
problems (Rubin, 2005; Little et al., 2002). Among the two disciplines, technical tools of impor-
tance weighting (IW) and domain adaptation (DA) have been commonly applied. Recently, there
has been widespread interest in adapting those tools for learning the best recommendation (Schn-"

INTRODUCTION,0.0070921985815602835,"abel et al., 2016; Bonner and Vasile, 2018), but we find a critical discussion missing from most
existing literature in this direction. In many scientific disciplines, the effectiveness of IW and DA
relies heavily on overlapping between source and target domain (Austin and Stuart, 2015; David
et al., 2010). The underlying reason also happens to be the motivation of exploration-exploitation
techniques including bandits and reinforcement learning (Auer et al., 2002; Sutton and Barto, 1998):
in the less-explored regions where few observations are collected, the confidence of selecting any
hypothesis is discounted."
INTRODUCTION,0.00851063829787234,"Unfortunately, modern IR systems are often cautious about exposing users to less relevant content
for the sake of immediate satisfaction and revenue, even with the help of bandits or RL (Bonner and
Vasile, 2018). In particular, many real-world recommenders are deterministic, e.g., an item is shown
with probability either zero or one, which further limits the exploration and thus the coverage of
collected data. In Section 3, we rigorously prove for both IW- and DA-based learning the hardness
or impossibility results caused by insufficient overlap. Intuitively, when a less-explored instance
is passed to a candidate hypothesis, even if DA or IW can improve the accuracy of the prediction,
they inevitably increase the uncertainty of that prediction as a consequence of the bias-variance
tradeoff. To a certain point, the increased uncertainty from having too many instances in the weakly
overlapped regions will fundamentally limit what any learning procedure can achieve. Further, if the
instance lies in the non-overlapped region, we can barely exceed regular extrapolation1 (Xu et al.,
2021b)."

INTRODUCTION,0.011347517730496455,"We resolve the fundamental limitation of insufficient overlapping in IR with the key insight that the
interventional impact of recommendation is not exclusive to observed data, but also interferes with
the target domain of interest — the instances that will be affected by the recommendations we are
about to make. For instance, the placement of a recommendation on the webpage proposed to the
user directly influences the occurrence of clicks. Therefore, we alternatively consider optimizing
recommendation as searching for an intervention that best transports the patterns it learns from the
source domain to its intervention domain. The procedure is best described by transport instead of
transfer because it will interfere with how the learnt patterns are carried to the target domain. This
change of view describes a complex but realistic working mechanism that involves learning, inter-
vention, and transportation, as depicted in Figure 1. On the one hand, we wish to learn patterns that
can be transported to the target domain of interest. On the other hand, the patterns we identify lead
to the intervention (in the form of recommendation) that generates the target domain. Following this
working mechanism, we impose constraints on the domain transportation between the (reweighted)
source domain and the future intervention domain. We point out that reweighting is essential for
learning from interventional feedback data (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983), especially for the work-
ing mechanism we identify here because the relationship between the source and target domain is
more involved. Towards this end, we propose a novel solution via transportation-constraint risk
minimization. We rigorously investigate for our objective:"

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.02269503546099291,"Bottou et al. (2013) first reveals the importance of characterizing the working mechanism of IR
systems. However, they study specifically the advertising systems where the underlying causal
structures are assumed given. Our work significantly extends their discussion by moving beyond
causal mechanisms. Issues caused by ignoring the interventional nature of recommendation have
been pointed out for numerous scenarios (Chen et al., 2020). Steck (2010) and Liang et al. (2016)
address optimizing recommendation in the context of missing data and causal inference, and the
majority of recent follow-up work investigate particularly inverse propensity weighting (IPW) and
learning domain invariant representation methods (Chen et al., 2020; Saito, 2020; Yang et al., 2018;
Joachims et al., 2017; Bonner and Vasile, 2018; Agarwal et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020). As mentioned
in Section 1, they largely ignore the overlapping issue even when the recommendation is determin-
istic. Our theoretical results on the interplay between overlapping and learning performance are
novel and add to the current venue of revealing the tradeoff for IW- and DA-based learning (Byrd
and Lipton, 2019; Johansson et al., 2019; Ben-David and Urner, 2012). See Appendix D for further
discussions on related work."
RELATED WORK,0.024113475177304965,"Existing solutions for insufficient overlapping focus primarily on reducing or calibrating the vari-
ance, e.g., as discussed in Swaminathan and Joachims (2015b); Wang et al. (2020); Johansson et al.
(2020). They do not account for the unique working mechanism of IR where the domain discrepancy
can be actively controlled. We devise the domain-transportation constraint using the Wasserstein dis-
tance originated from the optimal transport theory (Courty et al., 2016; Redko et al., 2017). The idea
of converting a Wasserstein-constraint objective to two-player minimax game is similar to that of
the generative adversarial network (Gulrajani et al., 2017), however, we do not make any generative
assumption on the observed data. Finally, learning from bandit feedback and the associated coun-
terfactual risk minimization can be viewed as a special case of our framework (Swaminathan and
Joachims, 2015a). We will use it as a test bed to examine the guarantees of the proposed approach."

PRELIMINARIES,0.028368794326241134,"For clarity, we borrow the item recommendation setting to illustrate the IR system we discuss next.
The set of all users and items are given by U and I. To be concise, we denote the features (or
pre-trained embeddings) for users and items by xu for u ∈U and xi for i ∈I. We study primarily
the practical implicit-feedback setting with Yui ∈{0, 1}, e.g., users express preferences implicitly
via clicks. Let D be the population of all possible (xu, xi) or (u, i) depending on the context. The
embeddings can also be free parameters under the representation mapping f from X or U ∪I to Rd.
We let P be any base probability measure supported on the subsets of D, and let Pn be the empirical
versions according to the collected feedback of Dn where n is the sample size. We assume the
weight of a user-item is positive and bounded by a constant M. Equipped with either individual
weights wui ∈[0, M] or weighting function w : U × I (or X × X) →[0, M], the reweighted
measures are given by such as: Pw(u, i) ∝w(u, i) · P(u, i)."

We denote this procedure by the function: reco(u, i; f) ∈{0, 1}. Define the new measure on
D induced by deploying f on D as: Pf(u, i) ∝reco(u, i; f) · P(u, i). If we choose the base

PRELIMINARIES,0.03546099290780142,"We now rigorously justify our previous intuition that insufficient overlapping causes uncertainty that
fundamentally limits what IW- and DA-based learning can achieve. While the results we show for
IW are universal, i.e., it applies to any hypothesis class, we discuss particularly for DA the skip-
gram negative sampling (SGNS) algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013). The reason is that SGNS is a
widespread technique for learning user or item embedding in IR systems (Xu et al., 2021a), and its
more straightforward formulation will allow us to present concise theoretical results to the readers."
PRELIMINARIES,0.03687943262411347,"As a gentle introduction, IW-based learning uses the ratio Q(u, i)/P(u, i) – where P and Q rep-
resent the source and target domain – to reweigh the loss of each instance in order to correct the
distribution shift. On the other hand, DA-based learning assumes there exists some hypothesis that
makes the optimal joint risk of inff∈F[EQR(f) + EP R(f)] small. For IW, we show the hardness
of learning, i.e., the best target risk inff EQR(f) can be uncontrolled for any F due to insufficient
overlapping. For DA, we show the impossibility of learning, i.e., there does not exist a solution of
SGNS that can make the optimal joint risk small when P and Q are not aligned.

they emphasize conceptually on different learning guarantees (Germain et al., 2009), and while the
latter can handle the existence of non-overlap (SP ̸= SQ), we find them both showing insufficient
overlapping (characterized by the discrepancy terms d1 and dKL) can cause arbitrarily large gaps
leading to poor generalizations to the target domain. For DA with SGNS, our lower bound reveals
the impact of insufficient overlapping indirectly via a notion of co-occurrence statistics defined in
Xu et al. (2021a). In particular, if the source and target domains are well-aligned in terms of the
co-occurrence statistics, the increased divergence term can make it impossible to find a hypothesis
that simultaneously performs well in both domains. Although this result holds only for SGNS, it
nevertheless suggests the limitations of DA caused by insufficient overlapping in IR."

longer perceive reweighting as a change-of-measure tool commonly implied in the causal inference

be difficult to define precisely. However, if we make a a mild assumption that all patterns can be
recovered by Lipschitz-bound functions, it immediately becomes clear that the Wasserstein distance

ity check, when ρ = 0, the feasible set is given by: f(u, i) = w(u, i) for all (u, i), so we are directly
optimizing the associated risk of the deployment domain. However, this is a suboptimal practice for
deterministic recommenders because in that case, only a small proportion of the feedback data will
be considered and the result can be heavily biased toward the historical recommendation. Therefore,
a suitable ρ will give us the opportunity to better explore the whole feedback data. Nevertheless, if
ρ becomes too large, we are likely to overfit the feedback data due to the high capacity of f and w

the proposed transportation-constraint risk minimization. In particular, the generalization error re-
veals how we resolve the previous drawback mentioned for using DA in IR system. Recall from
Section 3 that the joint optimal risk might be uncontrolled for DA since it can depend on how dif-
ferent the training and target domains are. In this regard, with D(w, f) ≤ρ explicitly constrains
the discrepancy between the training and deployment domain, we have the additional −λρ term in
the generalization error bound where the second term on the RHS can be think of as the empirical
”transported” risk. In other words, the constraint ensures that the deployment risk will not deviate
far from the training risk, and thus creates the possibility of learning transportable recommenda-
tion. Further, the excessive risk bound suggests that the transportation constraint does not cost the
convergence rate comparing with the standard empirical risk minimization guarantee (Mohri et al.,
2018)."

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION"
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION,0.20425531914893616,"In this paper, we study from the critical intervention perspective of recommendation and summarize
a domain transportation view supported by the realistic working mechanism of IR systems. We
propose a principled transportation-constraint risk minimization for optimizing recommendation,
and illustrate by both theories and experiments how we find it more favorable than directly importing
the causal inference and missing data solutions. However, we point out that our work does not aim
to replace those solutions since we focus exclusively on optimizing recommendation. For instance,
we do not readily incorporate the known causal mechanisms (which might be available for certain
applications) to answer questions that are relevant to the decision making in IR. It will be interesting
to explore how the presumed or discovered causal structures can interact with domain transportation
and improve our solution. Towards this end, our transportation-constraint risk minimization can be
viewed as a modular toolkit that allows researchers to apply further insights to solve more complex
IR problems. Finally, we hope our work raises the awareness of developing IR-oriented solutions
with a proper understanding of the system’s mechanism. The novel perspectives, solutions, and
theoretical results in our paper may also open the door to future research."

RECOMMENDER WITH EXPLORATION POLICY, AND LEARNING FROM BANDIT
FEEDBACK DATA"
REFERENCES,0.30638297872340425,"Using multi-armed bandits for exploration has attracted increasing attention from the recommen-
dation literature in recent years. The major advantage is that the interactive process between users
and recommender is explicitly characterized in an online fashion. Exploration also helps alleviate
the exposure bias, popularity bias, position bias, etc, via more efficient exploitation of the feedback
data. A critical difference between the bandit recommender and the deterministic recommender we
referred to in our paper is that an item is exposed to the user with randomness, and the exploration
policy controls the randomness in the exposure."
REFERENCES,0.3078014184397163,"Mathematically, we continue with X as the context (feature) space, I = {1, . . . , k} be the action
(item) space. The exploration-exploitation strategy can be viewed as a sequential game between the
user and recommender. For notation simplicity, we introduce the stationary bandit setting where
the exploration policy does not depend on the history. In each round, an item is sampled according
to the exploration policy π(u, i) := π(i | xu), which is a mapping between the item space and
the probability space, and expose it to the user. Then the user, whose feature is xu, reveal the
regret (or reward) action i ∈I, which corresponds to the Yu,i in our setting. In the context of
delivering recommendation, clearly we have: P(reco(u, i; f) = 1) = π(u, i) during exploration,
and in the context of learning from the logged feedback data, we have P(Oui = 1) = π(u, i) since
it characterizes the probability of exposure."
REFERENCES,0.30921985815602837,"Similar to the deterministic recommender, the challenge in bandit offline learning is largely due to its
partial-observation nature as we do not observe the complete reward for all items. However, unlike
the deterministic recommender, the random exposure mechanism allows efficient estimation of the
counterfactual regret, i.e. what the regret would have become if an alternative exploration policy
was used. The IPW estimator fits particularly well to this purpose, since it provides the unbiased
estimation of the counterfactual regret:"

bandit feedback data. It exactly corresponds to setting the base measure P with PIPW, so it holds:

which consists of around 1 million ratings collected from 60,40 users on 3,952 movies.
The movie ratings are ranged from 1 to 5, where a higher rating indicates more positive
feedback. Hence, the original Movielens-1M dataset possesses explicit feedback. The
traditional way of converting the dataset to implicit feedback is to set the rating cut-off
at 3, as suggested by He et al. (2017). We use the explicit feedback for semi-synthetic
experiments, and use the converted explicit feedback for the real-data experiments."

listeners (recorded in the dataset) tags the artists they may find fond of overtime. Since the
tag is a binary indicator, the LastFM is an implicit feedback dataset. There is a total of
186,479 tagging events, where 12,523 artists have been tagged.
• GoodReads 6. The book recommendation dataset is obtained from the users’ public shelves
on Goodread.com. We use the user review data on the history and biography sections for
their richness. There are in total 238,450 users, 302,346 unique books, and 2,066,193
ratings in these sections. The rating range is also from 1 to 5, and a higher rating indicates
more positive feedback. We concert the dataset to implicit feedback in the same way as the
Movielens-1M dataset for the real-data experiments."
N,0.873758865248227,"Data preprocessing. As for preprocessing, we point out that the Movielens-1M dataset has been
filtered by the publisher, where each user has rated at least 20 movies. For the LastFM and Goodread
datasets, we first filter the infrequent items and users who have less than 20 total interactions as well."
N,0.875177304964539,"C.1.1
SIMULATION SETTING"
N,0.8765957446808511,"We generate the implicit feedback (clicks) according to the click model of: P(Yui = 1) = P(Rui =
1) · P(Oui = 1), where Rui and Oui indicates the relevance and exposure. We refer to P(Rui = 1)
as the relevance score. To carry over the inductive bias of the benchmark dataset to the generated
data, we first learn P(Rui = 1) and P(Oui = 1) from the explicit feedback data of Movielens-1M
and GoodReads. Our simulation approach does not apply to the LastFM data because it lacks the
explicit feedback."
N,0.8780141843971632,"Since the ratings are explicit indicators for relevance, we directly conduct the matrix factorization
collaborative filtering (MCF) using the ratings as the response. We then estimate Psim(Rui = 1)
via σ( ˆRui −u)p, where σ(·) is the sigmoid function, and u and p are the two hyperparameters that
help us control the overall relevance distribution between the original and generated data. For both
Movielens-1M and GoodReads, we find u = 3 and p = 2 gives a decent approximation. In this way,
we inherit the inductive bias for the relevance to the simulated data."
N,0.8794326241134752,"As for the exposure, we first assume all the exposed movies/books are rated by the user, so we
have Oui = 1 if and only if Yui > 0. We then conduct another MCF using the converted Oui as
response, and obtain the user and item embedding: Φ(u), Φ(i). We further design the exposure
model by Psim(Oui = 1) = σ(MLP([Φ(u), Φ(i)])), where MLP(·) is a three-layer feed-forward
neural network with ReLU activation and no bias terms, whose parameters are given by the random
normal initialization."
N,0.8808510638297873,"In the sequel, the simulated click probability is given by: Psim(Yui = 1) = Psim(Rui = 1) ·
Psim(Oui = 1), from which we generated the click data by picking the cutoff probability that ensures
the click v.s. non-click proportion of the generated data matches that of the original data."

TRAIN-VALIDATION-TEST SPLIT"
N,0.8836879432624114,"We adopt the widely-acknowledged approach for splitting the dataset to training, validation and test-
ing as in He et al. (2017) and Rendle et al. (2020). In particular, we leverage the ordering information
and use the last interaction of each user for testing, the second-to-last interaction for validation, and
the previous interactions for training. All three datasets are provided with the ordering information,
so we use the same splitting mechanism. For the semi-synthetic dataset, since the simulation does
not account for the ordering information, we treat the ordering as random and conduct the splitting in
the same fashion. We point out here that using sequential recommendation models is not reasonable
in this case, so we do not experiment with the attention models (Attn) in the simulation experiments."

{i1, . . . , i100} and compute NDCG@K and Recall@K according to where i′ is ranked among the
total of 101 items. We point out that the recent work by Krichene and Rendle (2020) points out
the potential bias issue of using the sampled metrics; however, it is still the mainstream approach
that is used in the majority of existing literature. We apply them here so our results can be directly
compared with the results in the relevant literature. To make up for the bias issue of using sam-
pled metric, we further consider the Rel@K metric, which ranks all the items {i1, . . . , i|I|} and see
where i′ is placed for each u′. In this way, we eliminate the bias of using sampled metric. Essen-
tially, Rel@K equals Recall@K with no sampling when each user interacts with only one item in
the testing data (which happens in our experiments by the way we conduct the train-validation-test
split)."
N,0.8921985815602836,"The only difference in computing the three metrics for the real-data and semi-synthetic experiments
is that we replace Yu′i′ by the underlying relevance score of Psim(Ru′i′ = 1). In this way, we obtain
a more accurate characterization of the actual testing performance. Finally, for the MovieLens and
Goodreads datasets, we adopt the tradition that the previously-interacted items are not considered
during the evaluation for each user. This is because in practice, the same movie or book should not
be exposed to the user repeatedly."

learning rate from {0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1}, and the ℓ2 regularization parameter from {0, 0.01,
0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3}. The tuning parameters are selected separately to avoid excessive computations."
N,0.8992907801418439,"The other hyperparameters are identified according to the original papers as for the model-specific
configurations, other than the embedding dimension, learning rate, and ℓ2 regularization. For in-
stance, NCF considers the hidden dimensions of the feed-forward neural network as the hyperpa-
rameters, IPW-CF considers the IPW threshold, Attn considers the hidden dimension and number of
attention blocks, AC-MF considers the adversarial strength of the IPW component. We use the same
range as provided in their published implementations, which we discuss later in Appendix C.2.2.
When implemented with our transportation-regularized risk minimization, we focus primarily on
using the same ”base model” for f, w and g, e.g. with MCF, NCF or Attn. In fact, we can pick
any combinations for f, w and g, but we find the performances comparable to using the same ”base
model”, so we randomly pick some of the configurations to report, instead of exhausting all the
possibilities. Finally, the hyperparameters of the ”base models” persist to our setting, in addition to
the penalization parameter λ (in eq.(4)), which we select from {0.005, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5}."

use the clicks to estimate the propensities, and plug it to the DR approach. The causal embedding

same for the Goodreads and LastFM datasets. Firstly, the learnt weights for the instances among
the feedback data can be distinguished by whether the instance is positive or negative. We observe
that the positive instance tends to have larger weights than the negative instances, which means the
weighting model is learnt to emphasise the ”higher-quality” positive implicit feedback. Secondly,"

Pf with Pw, which conforms to our design. Lastly, for the simulation, the learnt weights tend to
be larger for the negative instances with higher exposure probability, which can be considered the
strong negative instances. This is because they are more likely to be exposed but are not clicked."

et al., 2019). For instance, Si et al. (2020) uses Wasserstein distance to assert certain robustness to
the contextual feature distribution during bandit off-policy learning, and Faury et al. (2020) proposes
a robust counterfactual learning framework to handle the various uncertainties in bandit feedback
data. Our work differs fundamentally from that research venue as we use Wasserstein distance to
regularize learnt policy (via constraining its deployment domain) rather than assert its robustness.
Further, DRO methods often have a min-max formulation, while our initial objective in (2) and (3)
tackle a min-min problem."
