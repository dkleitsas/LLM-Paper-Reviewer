ABSTRACT,0.0,"ABSTRACT
Offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can acquire effective policies by
utilizing previously collected experience, without any online interaction. It is
widely understood that offline RL is able to extract good policies even from highly
suboptimal data, a scenario where imitation learning finds suboptimal solutions
that do not improve over the demonstrator that generated the dataset. However,
another common use case for practitioners is to learn from data that resembles
demonstrations. In this case, one can choose to apply offline RL, but can also
use behavioral cloning (BC) algorithms, which mimic a subset of the dataset
via supervised learning. Therefore, it seems natural to ask: when can an offline
RL method outperform BC with an equal amount of expert data, even when BC
is a natural choice? To answer this question, we characterize the properties of
environments that allow offline RL methods to perform better than BC methods,
even when only provided with expert data. Additionally, we show that policies
trained on sufficiently noisy suboptimal data can attain better performance than
even BC algorithms with expert data, especially on long-horizon problems. We
validate our theoretical results via extensive experiments on both diagnostic and
high-dimensional domains including robotic manipulation, maze navigation, and
Atari games, with a variety of data distributions. We observe that, under specific but
common conditions such as sparse rewards or noisy data sources, modern offline
RL methods can significantly outperform BC."

INTRODUCTION
Offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms aim to leverage large existing datasets of previously
collected data to produce effective policies that generalize across a wide range of scenarios, without the
need for costly active data collection. Many recent offline RL algorithms [16, 26, 66, 27, 69, 61, 25]
can work well even when provided with highly suboptimal data, and a number of these approaches
have been studied theoretically [64, 71, 52, 20]. While it is clear that offline RL algorithms are a
good choice when the available data is either random or highly suboptimal, it is less clear if such
methods are useful when the dataset consists of demonstration that come from expert or near-expert
demonstrations. In these cases, imitation learning algorithms, such as behavorial cloning (BC), can
be used to train policies via supervised learning. It then seems natural to ask: When should we prefer
to use offline RL over imitation learning?"
INTRODUCTION,0.002551020408163265,"To our knowledge, there has not been a rigorous characterization of when offline RL perform better
than imitation learning. Existing empirical studies comparing offline RL to imitation learning
have come to mixed conclusions. Some works show that offline RL methods appear to greatly
outperform imitation learning, specifically in environments that require “stitching” parts of suboptimal
trajectories [14]. In contrast, a number of recent works have argued that BC performs better than
offline RL on both expert and suboptimal demonstration data over a variety of tasks [38, 12, 17].
This makes it confusing for practitioners to understand whether to use offline RL or simply run BC
on collected demonstrations. Thus, in this work we aim to understand if there are conditions on the
environment or the dataset under which an offline RL algorithm might outperform BC for a given
task, even when BC is provided with expert data or is allowed to use rewards as side information. Our
findings can inform a practitioner in determining whether offline RL is a good choice in their domain,
even when expert or near-expert data is available and BC might appear to be a natural choice."
INTRODUCTION,0.003826530612244898,"Our contribution in this paper is a theoretical and empirical characterization of certain conditions
when offline RL outperforms BC. Theoretically, our work presents conditions on the MDP and dataset

in practical problems, and provide guidance to the practitioner as to whether they should use RL or
BC. Concretely, we show that in the case of expert data, the error incurred by offline RL algorithms
can scale significantly more favorably when the MDP enjoys some structure, which includes horizon-
independent returns (i.e., sparse rewards) or a low volume of states where it is “critical” to take the
same action as the expert (Section 4.2). Meanwhile, in the case of sufficiently noisy data, we show
that offline RL again enjoys better guarantees on long-horizon tasks (Section 4.3). Finally, since
BC methods ignore rewards, we consider generalized BC methods that use the observed rewards to
inform learning, and show that it is still preferable to perform offline RL (Section 4.4)."
INTRODUCTION,0.007653061224489796,"Empirically, we validate our theoretical conclusions on diagnostic gridworld domains [13] and large-
scale benchmark problems in robotic manipulation and navigation and Atari games, using human
data [14], scripted data [60], and data generated from RL policies [3]. We verify that in multiple
long-horizon problems where the conditions we propose are likely to be satisfied, practical offline RL
methods can outperform BC and generalized BC methods. We show that using careful offline tuning
practices, we show that it is possible for offline RL to outperform cloning an expert dataset for the
same task, given equal amounts of data. We also highlight open questions for hyperparameter tuning
that have the potential to make offline RL methods work better in practice."

RELATED WORK,0.01020408163265306,"Offline RL [32, 34] has shown promise in domains such as robotic manipulation [22, 37, 60, 23],
NLP [19] and healthcare [58, 63]. The major challenge in offline RL is distribution shift [16, 26],
where the learned policy might execute out-of-distribution actions. Prior offline RL methods can
broadly be characterized into two categories: (1) policy-constraint methods that regularize the learned
policy to be “close” to the behavior policy either explicitly [16, 26, 36, 66, 15] or implicitly [59, 47,
45], or via importance sampling [35, 62, 43], and (2) conservative methods that learn a conservative,
estimate of return and optimize the policy against it [27, 25, 24, 69, 70]. Our goal is not to devise a
new algorithm, but to understand when existing offline RL methods can outperform BC."
RELATED WORK,0.011479591836734694,"When do offline RL methods outperform BC? Rashidinejad et al. [52] derive a conservative offline RL
algorithm based on lower-confidence bounds (LCB) that provably outperforms BC in the simpler
contextual bandits (CB) setting, but do not extend it to MDPs. While this CB result signals the
possibility that offline RL can outperform BC in theory, this generalization is not trivial, as RL suffers
from compounding errors [41, 42, 64]. Laroche et al. [33], Nadjahi et al. [44], Kumar et al. [27], Liu
et al. [36], Xie et al. [68] present safe policy improvement bounds expressed as improvements over the
behavior policy, which imitation aims to recover, but these bounds do not clearly indicate when offline
RL is better or worse. Empirically, Fu et al. [14] show that offline RL considerably outperforms
BC for tasks that require “stitching” trajectory segments to devise an optimal policy. In contrast,
Mandlekar et al. [38], Brandfonbrener et al. [6], Chen et al. [8], Hahn et al. [17] suggest that BC or
filtered BC using the top fraction of the data performs better on other tasks. While the performance
results in D4RL [14], especially on the Adroit domains, show that offline RL outperforms BC even
on expert data, Florence et al. [12] reported superior BC results, making it unclear if the discrepancy
arises from different hyperparameter tuning practices. Kurenkov & Kolesnikov [31] emphasize
the importance of the online evaluation budget for offline RL methods and show that BC is more
favorable in a limited budget. While these prior works discussed above primarily attempt to show that
BC can be better than offline RL, we attempt to highlight when offline RL is expected to be better by
providing a characterization of scenarios where we would expect offline RL to be better than BC, and
empirical results verifying that offline RL indeed performs better on such problems [14, 60, 4]."
RELATED WORK,0.012755102040816327,"Our theoretical analysis combines tools from a number of prior works. We analyze the total error
incurred by RL via an error propagation analysis [41, 42, 11, 7, 67, 36], which gives rise to bounds
with concentrability coefficients that bound the total distributional shift between the learned policy
and the data distribution [67, 36]. We use tools from Ren et al. [53], which provide horizon-free
bounds for standard (non-conservative) offline Q-learning but relax their strict coverage assumptions.
While our analysis studies a LCB-style algorithm similar to Rashidinejad et al. [52], Jin et al. [20],
we modify it to use tighter Bernstein bonuses [73, 1], which is key to improving the guarantee."

addition, there are scenarios where C∗> 1 even though the expert behaves optimally: for example,
when the environment is stochastic or in the presence of small distribution shifts in the environment.
One practical example of this is when the initial state distribution changes between dataset collection
and evaluation (e.g., in robotics [60], or self-driving [5]). Since the normalized state-action marginals

from the optimal trajectory, or when identifying an optimal
trajectory is easy: this could be simply because there exists
a large volume of near-optimal trajectories, or because at
all but a few states, the volume of “good-enough” actions

to do so since it simply mimics the data distribution. On the other hand, BC and RL perform equally
well at critical states. We can control the convergence rate of RL by adjusting ∆, and |G(s)|, whereas
BC does not benefit from this and incurs a suboptimality that matches the information-theoretic lower

EMPIRICAL EVALUATION OF BC AND OFFLINE RL
Having characterized scenarios where offline RL methods can outperform BC in theory, we now
validate our results empirically. Concretely, we aim to answer the following questions: (1) Does
an existing offline RL method trained on expert data outperform BC on expert data in MDPs with
few critical points?, (2) Can offline RL trained on noisy data outperform BC on expert data?, and
(3) How does full offline RL compare to the reward-aware BC methods studied in Section 4.4?
We first validate our findings on high-dimensional domains below, but we provide some diagnostic
experiments on a gridworld domain in Appendix H."
EMPIRICAL EVALUATION OF BC AND OFFLINE RL,0.12627551020408162,"Evaluation in high-dimensional tasks. Next, we turn to high-dimensional problems. We consider a
diverse set of domains and behavior policies that are representative of practical scenarios: multi-stage
robotic manipulation tasks from state (Adroit domains from Fu et al. [14]) and image observa-
tions [60], antmaze navigation [14], and 7 Atari games [3]. We use the scripted expert provided by
Fu et al. [14] for antmaze and those provided by Singh et al. [60] for manipulation, an RL-trained
expert for Atari, and human expert for Adroit [50]. We obtain suboptimal data using failed attempts
from a noisy expert policy (i.e., previous policies in the replay buffer for Atari, and noisy scripted
experts for antmaze and manipulation). All these tasks utilize sparse rewards such that the return
of any trajectory is bounded by a constant much smaller than the horizon. We use CQL [27] as a
representative RL method, and utilize Brandfonbrener et al. [6] as a representative BC-PI method."
EMPIRICAL EVALUATION OF BC AND OFFLINE RL,0.12755102040816327,"Tuning offline RL and BC. Na¨ıvely running offline RL can lead to poor performance, as noted
by prior works [38, 12]. This is also true for BC, but, some solutions such as early stopping based
on validation losses, can help improve performance. We claim that an offline tuning strategy is
also crucial for offline RL. In our experiments we utilize the offline workflow proposed by Kumar
et al. [30] to perform policy selection, and address overfitting and underfitting, purely offline. While
this workflow does not fully address all the tuning issues, we find that it is sufficient to improve
performance. When the Q-values learned by CQL are extremely negative (typically on the Adroit
domains), we utilize a capacity-decreasing dropout regularization with probability 0.4 on the layers
of the Q-function to combat overfitting. On the other hand, when the Q-values exhibit a relatively
stable trend (e.g., in Antmaze or Atari), we utilize the DR3 regularizer [29] to increase capacity.
Consistent with prior work, we find that na¨ıve offline RL generally performs worse than BC without
offline tuning, but we find that tuned offline RL can work well. For tuning BC and BC-PI, we
applied regularizers such as dropout on the policy to prevent overfitting in Adroit, and utilized a
larger ResNet [18] architecture for the robotic manipulation tasks and Atari domains. For BC, we
report the performance of the best checkpoint found during training, giving BC an unfair advantage,
but we still find that offline-tuned offline RL can do better better. More details about tuning each
algorithm can be found in Appendix F."

we observe that offline-tuned offline RL can outperform BC on various practical problem domains,
with different kinds of expert policies. While our work is an initial step towards understanding
when RL presents a favorable approach, there is still plenty of room for further investigation. Our
theoretical analysis can be improved to handle function approximation. Understanding if offline RL is
preferred over BC for other real-world data distributions is also important. Finally, our work focuses
on analyzing cases where we might expect offline RL to outperform BC. An interesting direction is to
understand cases where the opposite holds; such analysis would further contribute to this discussion."

reward information. Intuitively, we can partition the states into two categories:"

case, when BC is trained using only expert trajectories, and the environment consists of a stochastic
dynamics, then running the BC policy during evaluation may diverge to low reward regions as
shown in the second row, second column of Figure 5. On the other hand, if RL is provided with
some noisy-expert data that visits states around expert trajectories which might eventually lead to
low-rewarding states, then an effective offline RL method should be able to figure out how to avoid
such states and solve the task successfully."

high-enough density µ(s, a) ≥b under the data distribution. There are two ways to attain this
condition: (1) the expert policy already sufficiently explores the state (d∗(s, a) ≥b), for example,
when the environment is mostly deterministic or when trajectories are cyclic (e.g., in locomotion
tasks discussed below), or, (2) the offline dataset is noisy such that states that are less-frequently
visited by the expert are explored more in the data. The latter can be satisfied when the agent is
provided with “negative data”, i.e., failed trajectories, starting from states in an optimal trajectory
as shown in Figure 5. Such counterfactual trajectories allow the agent to observe more outcomes
starting from a state in the optimal trajectory. And running offline RL on them will enable the agent
to learn what not to do, as illustrated in Figure 5. On the other hand, BC cannot use this negative data."

partly trained RL policies for noisy collection for running offline RL). Another simple way

robotics, rolling out short counterfactual trajectories from states visited in the offline data,

satisfy this condition by tuning the amount of counterfactual data they augment to training.
• Recommender systems: In recommender systems, Chen et al. [9] found that it was practical
to add additional stochasticity while rolling out a policy for data collection which could be
controlled, enabling the practitioner to satisfy this condition.
• Trajectories consist of cyclic states (e.g., robot locomotion, character animation in
computer graphics): This condition can be satisfied in several applications such as lo-
comotion (e.g., in character animation in computer graphics [46], or open-world robot
navigation [57]) where the states observed by the agent are repeated over the course of the
trajectory. Therefore a state with sufficient density under the optimal policy may appear

closure. However, this analysis concerns policy evaluation and applies to policies that go out of the
support of the offline data. This does not necessarily prove that any conservative offline RL algorithm
(i.e., one that prevents the learned policy from going out of the support of the offline dataset) would
suffer from this issue during policy learning, just that there exist policies for which evaluation would
be exponentially bad. Offline RL can exactly prevent the policy from going out of the support of the
dataset in Zanette [71]’s counterexample since the dynamics and reward functions are deterministic.
This policy can still improve over behavior cloning by stitching overlapping trajectories, similar to
the discussion of one-step vs multi-step PI in Theorem 4.4. Thus, while the lower-bound applies to
off-policy evaluation of some target policies, it doesn’t apply to evaluation of every policy in the MDP,
and specifically does not apply to in-support policies, which modern offline RL algorithms produce,
in theory and practice. Certainly, their lower bound would apply to an algorithm aiming to estimate
Q∗from the offline data, but that’s not the goal of pessimistic algorithms that we study. Finally, our

varying number of critical states, from “Single Critical” with exactly one, to “Cliffwalk” where every
state is critical and veering off yields zero reward. The methods we consider are: naive BC (BC),
conservative RL (RL-C), policy-constraint RL (RL-PC), and generalized BC with one-step and k-step
policy improvement (BC-PI, BC-kPI). In the left plot of Figure 8, we show the return (normalized
by return of the optimal policy) across all the different environments for optimal data (C∗= 1)

C∗= 1, but RL-C and RL-PC performs much better when C∗> 1; also BC with one-step policy
improvement outperforms naive BC for C∗> 1, but does not beat full offline RL. In Figure 8, we
vary C∗by interpolating the dataset with one generated by a random policy, where α is the proportion
