REFERENCES,0.6,"A good summary is a shorter piece of text that has the essence of the
original.

information from the original post.

for summary quality:
coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality."
REFERENCES,0.6008695652173913,"Coherence:
This axis answers the question “how coherent is the summary
on its own?” A summary is coherent if it’s easy to understand when read
on its own and free of English errors.
A summary is not coherent if it’s
difficult to understand what the summary is trying to say.
Generally, it’s
more important that the summary is understandable than it being free of
grammar errors."
REFERENCES,0.6017391304347826,"Accuracy:
This axis answers the question “does the factual information
in the summary accurately match the post?” A summary is accurate if it
doesn’t say things that aren’t in the article, it doesn’t mix up people,
and generally is not misleading."
REFERENCES,0.6026086956521739,"Coverage:
This axis answers the question “how well does the summary cover
the important information in the post?” A summary has good coverage if it
mentions the main information from the post that’s important to understand
the situation described in the post.
A summary has poor coverage if
someone reading only the summary would be missing several important pieces
of information about the situation in the post.
A summary with good
coverage should also match the purpose of the original post (e.g.
to ask
for advice)."
REFERENCES,0.6034782608695652,"Overall quality:
This axis answers the question “how good is the summary
overall at representing the post?” This can encompass all of the above axes
of quality, as well as others you feel are important.
If it’s hard to find
ways to make the summary better, the overall quality is good.

lots of different ways the summary can be made better, the overall quality
is bad."
