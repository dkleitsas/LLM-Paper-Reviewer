ABSTRACT,0.0011947431302270011,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0023894862604540022,"As a long-term threat to the privacy of training data, membership inference attacks
(MIAs) emerge ubiquitously in machine learning models. Existing works evidence
strong connection between the distinguishability of the training and testing loss
distributions and the model’s vulnerability to MIAs. Motivated by existing results,
we propose a novel training framework based on a relaxed loss (RelaxLoss) with
a more achievable learning target, which leads to narrowed generalization gap
and reduced privacy leakage. RelaxLoss is applicable to any classification model
with added benefits of easy implementation and negligible overhead. Through
extensive evaluations on five datasets with diverse modalities (images, medical
data, transaction records), our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-
art defense mechanisms in terms of resilience against MIAs as well as model
utility. Our defense is the first that can withstand a wide range of attacks while
preserving (or even improving) the target model’s utility. Source code is available

INTRODUCTION,0.0047789725209080045,"While deep learning (DL) models have achieved tremendous success in the past few years, their
deployments in many sensitive domains (e.g., medical, financial) bring privacy concerns since data
misuse in these domains induces severe privacy risks to individuals. In particular, modern deep neural
networks (NN) are prone to memorize training data due to their high capacity, making them vulnerable
to privacy attacks that extract detailed information about the individuals from models (Shokri et al.,
2017; Song et al., 2017; Yeom et al., 2018) ."
INTRODUCTION,0.005973715651135006,"In membership inference attack (MIA), an adversary attempts to identify whether a specific data
sample was used to train a target victim model. This threat is pervasive in various data domains
(e.g., images, medical data, transaction records) and inevitably poses serious privacy threats to
individuals (Shokri et al., 2017; Nasr et al., 2018; Salem et al., 2019), even given only black-box
access (query inputs in, posterior predictions out) (Shokri et al., 2017; Salem et al., 2019; Song &
Mittal, 2020) or partially observed output predictions (e.g., top-k predicted labels) (Choo et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.007168458781362007,"Significant advances have been achieved to defend against MIAs. Conventionally, regularization
methods designed for mitigating overfitting such as dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) and weight-
decay (Geman et al., 1992) are regarded as defense mechanisms (Salem et al., 2019; Jia et al.,
2019; Shokri et al., 2017). However, as conveyed by Kaya et al. (2020); Kaya & Dumitras (2021),
vanilla regularization techniques (which are not designed for MIA), despite slight improvement
towards reducing the generalization gap, are generally unable to eliminate MIA. In contrast, recent
works design defenses tailored to MIA. A common strategy among such defenses is adversarial
training (Goodfellow et al., 2014b;a), where a surrogate attack model (represented as a NN) is used
to approximate the real attack and subsequently the target model is modified to maximize prediction
errors of the surrogate attacker via adversarial training. This strategy contributes to remarkable success
in defending NN-based attacks (Nasr et al., 2018; Jia et al., 2019). However, these methods are greatly"

unanticipated by the defender (e.g., a simple metric-based attack) (Song & Mittal, 2020). In order
to defend attacks beyond the surrogate one, differentially private (DP) training techniques (Abadi
et al., 2016; Papernot et al., 2016; 2018) that provide strict guarantees against MIA are exploited.
Nevertheless, as evidenced by Rahman et al. (2018); Jia et al. (2019); Hayes et al. (2019); Jayaraman

compromises model utility and increases computation cost."
INTRODUCTION,0.011947431302270013,"In this paper, we present an effective defense against MIAs while avoiding negative impacts on
the defender’s model utility. Our approach is built on two main insights: (i) the optimal attack
only depends on the sample loss under mild assumptions of the model parameters (Sablayrolles
et al., 2019); (ii) a large difference between the training loss and the testing loss provably causes
high membership privacy risks (Yeom et al., 2018). By intentionally ‘relaxing’ the target training
loss to a level which is more achievable for the test loss, our approach narrows the loss gap and
reduces the distinguishability between the training and testing loss distributions, effectively preventing
various types of attacks in practice. Moreover, our approach allows for a utility-preserving (or even
improving) defense, greatly improving upon previous results. As a practical benefit, our approach is
easy to implement and can be integrated into any classification models with minimal overhead."
INTRODUCTION,0.013142174432497013,"Contributions. (i) We propose RelaxLoss, a simple yet effective defense mechanism to strengthen a
target model’s resilience against MIAs without degrading its utility. To the best of our knowledge, our
approach for the first time addresses a wide range of attacks while preserving (or even improving) the
model utility. (ii) We derive our method from a Bayesian optimal attacker and provide both empirical
and analytical evidence supporting the main principles of our approach. (iii) Extensive evaluations

RELATED WORK,0.015531660692951015,"Membership Inference Attack.
Inferring membership information from deep NNs has been
investigated in various application scenarios, ranging from the white-box setting where the whole
target model is released (Nasr et al., 2019; Rezaei & Liu, 2020) to the black-box setting where the
complete/partial output predictions are accessible to the adversary (Shokri et al., 2017; Salem et al.,
2019; Yeom et al., 2018; Sablayrolles et al., 2019; Song & Mittal, 2020; Choo et al., 2020; Hui et al.,
2021; Truex et al., 2019). An adversary first determines the most informative features (depending
on the application scenarios) that faithfully reflect the sample membership (e.g., logits/posterior
predictions (Shokri et al., 2017; Salem et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2019), loss values (Yeom et al.,
2018; Sablayrolles et al., 2019), and gradient norms (Nasr et al., 2019; Rezaei & Liu, 2020)), and
subsequently extracts common patterns in these features among the training samples for identifying
membership. In this work, we work towards an effective defense by suppressing the common patterns
that an optimal attack relies on."
RELATED WORK,0.016726403823178016,"Defense. Existing defense mechanisms against MIA are mainly divided into three main categories:
(i) regularization techniques to alleviate model overfitting, (ii) adversarial training to confuse surro-
gate attackers, and (iii) a differentially private mechanism offering rigorous privacy guarantees. Our
proposed approach can be regarded as a regularization technique owing to its effect in reducing gen-
eralization gap. Unlike previous regularization techniques, our method is explicitly tailored towards
defending MIAs by reducing the information that an attacker can exploit, leading to significantly
better defense effectiveness. Algorithmically, our approach shares similarity with techniques that
suppress the target model’s confidence score predictions (e.g., label-smoothing (Guo et al., 2017;
Müller et al., 2019) and confidence-penalty (Pereyra et al., 2017)), but ours is fundamentally different
in the sense that we modulate the loss distribution with gradient ascent."

ing (Goodfellow et al., 2014b;a). Such approaches usually rely on strong assumptions about attack
models, making their effectiveness highly dependent on the similarity between the surrogate and the
real attacker (Song & Mittal, 2020). In contrast, our method does not rely on any assumptions about
the attack model, and has shown consistent effectiveness across different attacker types."

samples that are close to the decision boundary
between two classes), it is very likely that one

incorrect predictions. To address this issue, we
propose to encourage a large margin between

ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS,0.1003584229390681,"RelaxLoss increases the variance of the training loss distribution.
We observe that RelaxLoss
spreads out the training loss distribution (i.e., increase the variance) due to its gradient ascent step
(Appendix A.1): large loss samples tend to have a more significant increase in its loss value during the
gradient ascent step (See Figure 2 for demonstration). In contrast, except DP-SGD, existing defense
methods do not have this property (Appendix C.10). Intuition suggests that the increase of training
loss variance suppresses the common pattern among training losses and reduces the information
that can be exploited by an attacker, thus contributing to the protection against attacks. To verify
the association between the variance increasing effect and the defense effectiveness, we conduct
experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset and measure the Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the
training loss variance and the attack AUC (Appendix Figure 6). With an overall score of -0.85 (-0.77
and -0.94 for black-box and white-box attacks, respectively), we conclude a fairly strong negative
relationship. When considering a typical Gaussian assumption of the loss distributions (Yeom et al.,

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP"
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.1063321385902031,"Settings.
We set up seven target models, trained on five datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CH-
MNIST, Texas100, Purchase100) with diverse modalities (natural and medical images, medical
records, and shopping histories). For image datasets, we adopt a 20-layer ResNet (He et al., 2016)
and an 11-layer VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015); and for non-image datasets, we adopt MLPs
with the same architecture and same training protocol as in previous works (Nasr et al., 2018; Jia
et al., 2019). We evenly split each dataset into five folds and use each fold as the training/testing set
for the target/shadow model3, and use the last fold for training the surrogate attack model (for Jia
et al. (2019); Shokri et al. (2017)). We fix the random seed and training setting for a fair comparison
among different defense methods. See Appendix B for implementation details."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.10752688172043011,"Attack methods. To broadly handle attack methods in our defense evaluation, we consider attacks in
a variety of application scenarios (black-box and white-box) and strategies. We consider the following
state-of-the-art attacks from two categories:(i) White-box attacks: Both Nasr et al. (2019); Rezaei &
Liu (2020) are based on gradient norm thresholding. We denote these attacks by the type of gradient
followed by its norm. Grad-x and Grad-w stand for the gradient w.r.t. the input and the model
parameters, respectively; (ii) Black-box attacks: Salem et al. (2019) (denoted as NN, standing for the
proposed neural network attack model). We adopt the implementation provided by Jia et al. (2019)
and use the complete logits prediction as input to the attacker. Sablayrolles et al. (2019) (denoted as
Loss for their loss thresholding method). We use a general threshold independent of the query sample,
as the adaptive thresholding version is more expensive computational-wise with no or only marginal
improvements. Song & Mittal (2020) (denoted as Entropy and M-Entropy for their proposed attack
by thresholding the prediction entropy and a modified version, respectively.). We exclude attacks that
only use partial output predictions (e.g., top-1 predicted label) from our evaluation as they are strictly
weaker than the attacks we include above (Choo et al., 2020)."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.1087216248506571,"Evaluation metrics. We evaluate along two fronts: utility (measured by test accuracy of the victim
model) and privacy. For privacy, in line with previous works (Song & Mittal, 2020; Jia et al., 2019;
Sablayrolles et al., 2019; Shokri et al., 2017; Nasr et al., 2018; Salem et al., 2019), we consider the
following two metrics: (i) attack accuracy: We evaluate the attack accuracy on a balanced query set,
where a random guessing baseline corresponds to 50% accuracy. For threshold-based attack methods,
following Song & Mittal (2020), we select the threshold value to be the one with the best attack
accuracy on the shadow model and shadow dataset; (ii) attack AUC: The area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC), corresponding to an integral over all possible threshold values,
represents the degree of separability. A perfect defense mechanism corresponds to AUC=0.5."

COMPARISON TO BASELINES,0.1111111111111111,"Defense Baselines. We consider two state-of-the-art defense methods: Memguard (Jia et al., 2019)

larization methods: Early-stopping, Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014), Label-smoothing (Guo et al.,
2017; Müller et al., 2019), Confidence-penalty (Pereyra et al., 2017) and (Self-)Distillation (Hinton
et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019). Moreover, we compare to differential private mechanism, i.e., Differ-
entially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) (Abadi et al., 2016)4. We exclude defenses
that additionally require public (unlabelled) data (Papernot et al., 2016; 2018) for training the target
model from our evaluation."

LOSS,0.14814814814814814,"Privacy-utility trade-off. We vary the hyperparameters that best describe the privacy-utility trade-off
of each method across their effective ranges (See Appendix B for details) and plot the corresponding
privacy-utility curves. We set the attack AUC value (privacy) as x-axis and the target model’s
performance (utility) as the y-axis. A better defense exhibits a privacy-utility curve approaching the
top-left corner, i.e., high utility and low privacy risk. As shown in Figure 3(a) and 3(b) (and Appendix
Figure 9-13), we observe that our method improves the privacy-utility trade-off over baselines for
almost all cases: (i) Previous state-of-the-art defenses (Memguard and Adv-Reg) are effective for the
NN attack, but can hardly generalize to the other types of attack, which is also verified in Song &
Mittal (2020). Moreover, as a test-time defense, Memguard is not applicable to white-box attacks.
In contrast, our method is consistently effective irrespective of the attack model and applicable to
all types of attacks. (ii) In comparison with other regularization methods, our method showcases
significantly better defense effectiveness. Specifically, when compared with Early-stopping, the
generally most effective regularization-based defense baseline, our approach decreases the attack
AUC (i.e., relative percentage change) by up to 26% on CIFAR-10 and 46% on CIFAR-100 for
a same level of utility. (iii) DP-SGD is generally the most effective defense baseline, despite the
meaningless large ϵ values, which is consistent with Choo et al. (2020). In comparison with DP-SGD,
our method improves the target model’s test accuracy by around 16% on CIFAR-10 and 12% on
CIFAR-100 (relative percentage increase) across different privacy levels. (iv) (See detailed results
in Appendix C.9) Our approach is the only one that exhibit consistent defense effectiveness across
various data modalities and model architectures, while the best baseline methods can only show
effectiveness for at most one data modality (e.g., DP-SGD for images, and Label-smoothing for
transaction records)."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.2747909199522103,"Properties of RelaxLoss.
RelaxLoss enjoys several properties which explain its superiority over
existing defense methods. In particular, we provide empirical and analytical evidence showing that in
contrast to most existing methods (Appendix C.10), RelaxLoss reduces the generalization gap and
spreads out the training loss distributions (Section 5), thereby effectively defeating MIAs. Moreover,
we observe that RelaxLoss soften the decision boundaries (Appendix C.11), which contributes to
improving model generalization (Zhang et al., 2017; Pereyra et al., 2017)."
DISCUSSION,0.27598566308243727,"Practicality.
We consider the practicality of our method from the following aspects: (i) Hyperpa-
rameter tuning: Our method involves a single hyperparameter α that controls the trade-off between
privacy and utility. A fine-grained grid search on a validation set (i.e., first estimating the privacy-
utility trade-off with varying value of α, and subsequently selecting the α corresponding to the desired
privacy/utility level) allows precise control over the expected privacy/utility level of the target model.
(ii) Computation cost: Our method incurs negligible additional computation cost when compared
with backpropagation in vanilla training (Appendix C.7). In contrast, baseline methods generally
suffer from a larger computation burden. For instance, Memguard slows down the inference due to
its test-time optimization step, while the training speed of DP-SGD and Adv-Reg is greatly hindered
by per-sample gradient computation (Goodfellow, 2015; Dangel et al., 2019) and adversarial update
step, respectively."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.27837514934289126,"In this paper, we present RelaxLoss, a novel training scheme that is highly effective in protecting
against privacy attacks while improving the utility of target models. Our primary insight is that
membership privacy risks can be reduced by narrowing the gap between the loss distributions. We
validate the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of datasets and models, and evidence its
superiority when compared with eight defense baselines which represent previous state of the art. As
RelaxLoss exhibits superior protection and performance and is easy to be implemented in various
machine learning models, we expect it to be highly practical and widely used."

Var(ℓ) and Var(ℓ+ ∆ℓ), respectively. Following from the fact that"

REFERENCES,0.3643966547192354,"We focus on the loss increase after the gradient ascent step (i.e., assuming that ∆ℓ≥0, which holds
for most cases, despite the stochasticity) and interpret ∆ℓas the rate of loss change. The condition
Cov(ℓ, ∆ℓ) > 0 can be understood as: the larger the loss value is, the faster it changes, and vice
versa. This is a reasonable assumption for most training algorithms for achieving convergence. We
reason the exact condition and the related assumptions below.
Condition A.1. The gradient magnitude (squared ℓ2 norm) is positively correlated to the loss value,
i.e., Cov(∥∇ℓ∥2

decreases."
REFERENCES,0.3655913978494624,We use the cross-entropy loss as an example:

prediction get closer to the ground-truth label. By the submultiplicativity of matrix norm and the
continuity of the squared function, we then have ∥∇ℓCE(θ, zi)∥2
2 →0, i.e., the gradient norm

Condition A.1.
Condition A.2. The change in loss after the gradient ascent step ∆ℓis linear in the squared gradient
norm ∥∇ℓ∥2
2, i.e., ∆ℓ= c1∥∇ℓ∥2

Corollary A.1. Given the assumption that the gradient of each sample within a batch (1) has the
same norm and (2) has non-negative inner product (i.e., well-aligned) with each other and the
gradient alignments remain the same over different batches, the gradient ascent step: θ(t+1) =
θ(t) + τ∇L(θ(t)) satisfy the linearity (in Condition A.2) with c1 > 0, where the superscript t
corresponds to the t-th iteration, and ∇L denotes the batch gradient with batchsize = B."

DEFENSE METHODS"

The basic idea behind Early-stopping is to truncate training before a model
starts to overfit. In our experiments, we save target models’ checkpoints at varying numbers of
training epochs and subsequently evaluate the attack AUC and test accuracy of each model check-
point. We set checkpoints at the following epochs: [25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275]
for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets; [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50] for CH-MNIST dataset;

C,0.47072879330943845,"Dropout. Dropout prevents co-adaptation of feature detectors by randomly masking out a set of
neurons in the networks, thereby alleviating model overfitting. In our experiments, we apply dropout
to the last fully-connected layer of each target model and evaluate across a wide range of dropout

provided by the Opacus library 13. We tune the clipping bound C when fixing the noise scale to 0.1,

model is trained on the target model’s predictions when inputting the target model’s training data

attack has been defended (i.e., attack AUC ≈0.5)."

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORKS"
C,0.4982078853046595,"Although RelaxLoss is empirically proven effective for improving target models’ utility, it is generally
hard to explain such improvement, as understanding the generalization ability is still an open problem.
As an attempt, we conduct experiments on toy datasets and attribute the improvement to a flat decision
boundary (See Appendix C.11). A thorough investigation into how each individual components of
our approach affects generalization are left for our future works. In addition, the assumptions of
model parameters (Sablayrolles et al., 2019) which are made for the optimal attack demand further
validation."

CORRELATION BETWEEN LOSS VARIANCE AND ATTACK AUC"
C,0.5005973715651135,"We plot the attack AUC values versus the training loss variance in Figure 6. Each point in the figure
corresponds to one target model trained with different defense mechanisms. We indeed observe a
negative correlation between the loss variance and the AUC value of both the black-box and white-box
attacks, which supports Section 5 in the main paper."

models in Table 1). And for the NN-based attack, we use the complete logits prediction from the
pre-trained shadow models as features to train the adaptive attack models (modeled as a NN). We

is less significant compared to non-adaptive attacks shown in Table 5."

See Figure 12-13: for binary medical and transaction

methods. Compared to our approach, Label-smoothing can achieve superior model utility when
the Attack AUC is of range around 0.65-0.8 on Texas100 and 0.55-0.65 on Purchase100. However,
our approach is able to reduce the attack AUC to around the random-guessing level, which is not
always possible for Label-smoothing (white-box attacks on Purchase100, black-box attacks on both
datasets)."
M-ENTROPY,0.7335722819593787,"DP-SGD exhibits unexpected results for these two datasets: small noise scale results in both lower
Attack AUC and higher model utility, which is contradictory to the common belief that small-scale
noise only provides weak privacy guarantee and thus the Attack AUC will remain high. We conjecture
that there exists a non-negligible gap between the worst-case privacy guarantee that provided by the
theoretical privacy analysis and the real-world attack performance in practice. Especially for the
small-scale noise case, the privacy cost ϵ is meaninglessly large and cannot faithfully reflect the risk
when facing practical MIAs. We tried varying the noise scale in the experiments: by decreasing
the noise scale, we find DP-SGD cannot reduce the Attack AUC to random-guessing level, while
by increasing the noise scale, the utility soon drops significantly. In comparison, our approach
consistently yields better privacy-utility trade-off."

when applying different defense methods on target models with a ResNet20 architecture trained on
CIFAR-10 dataset in Figure 14-20. In the parentheses of each subtitle, we show the hyper-parameter
values corresponding to each subfigure from left to right."
M-ENTROPY,0.8124253285543608,"We observe that: (i) Regularization techniques in general have limited effects in reducing the gap
between the training and testing loss distributions. (ii) Unlike our approach (See Figure 1 in the main
paper), baseline methods are generally not able to increase the training loss variance nor closing the
gaps between the member and non-member distributions, which explains the superior performance
of our approach in defending various types of MIAs. (iii) By setting a relatively large noise scale,
DP-SGD is able to increase the training loss variance and reducing the gap between the training and
testing loss values (See last column of Figure 17). However, the large scale of noise dampen the
learning signal in this case, leading to a non-negligible utility drop."

ANALYSIS OF MODEL GENERALIZATION"
M-ENTROPY,0.992831541218638,"As supplementary to Section 7 of our main paper, we show results of toy experiments that investigate
the impact of our approach on model generalization. We visualize the prediction scores and the
decision boundaries in Figure 21. In contrast to vanilla training that assigns high confidence scores on
hard examples near the decision boundary, our approach can soften the decision boundaries, leading
to a large area with low (and well-calibrated) predicted confidence scores. In line with Zhang et al.
(2017); Pereyra et al. (2017), we conjecture that the flatness of decision boundaries improves model
generalization, while an in-depth analysis is left as future work."
