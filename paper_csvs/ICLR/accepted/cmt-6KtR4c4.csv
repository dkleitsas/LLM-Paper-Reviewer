ABSTRACT,0.0024875621890547263,"With little to no parallel data available for programming languages, unsupervised
methods are well-suited to source code translation. However, the majority of unsu-
pervised machine translation approaches rely on back-translation, a method devel-
oped in the context of natural language translation and one that inherently involves
training on noisy inputs. Unfortunately, source code is highly sensitive to small
changes; a single token can result in compilation failures or erroneous programs,
unlike natural languages where small inaccuracies may not change the meaning of
a sentence. To address this issue, we propose to leverage an automated unit-testing
system to ﬁlter out invalid translations, thereby creating a fully tested parallel cor-
pus. We found that ﬁne-tuning an unsupervised model with this ﬁltered data set
signiﬁcantly reduces the noise in the translations so-generated, comfortably out-
performing the state-of-the-art for all language pairs studied. In particular, for
Java →Python and Python →C++ we outperform the best previous methods by
more than 16% and 24% respectively, reducing the error rate by more than 35%."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.007462686567164179,"Ancient languages such as COBOL still underpin much of the ﬁnancial industry and government ser-
vices. Their outdated structures and thinning developer bases induce costs and severely slow down
development, prompting businesses to modernize their codebases. For instance, the Commonwealth
Bank of Australia spent around $750 million over 5 years to migrate its COBOL codebase to a more
recent language. More generally, most large companies own code written in several programming
languages, which can hinder interoperability and make programmers less efﬁcient. Automatic trans-
lation systems could make codebase migrations faster and cheaper, and help programmers learn
new languages or understand existing code. Systems to automatically translate between program-
ming languages with approximately the same level of abstraction are called transpilers or source-
to-source compilers. They need to be distinguished from compilers which translate source code to
a lower-level language. The particularities of some languages allow the creation of very successful
rule-based transpilers for a few language pairs (e.g. Java→Scala, CoffeeScript→JavaScript). Meth-
ods leveraging veriﬁed lifting (Kamil et al., 2016), which offer formal guarantees, can signiﬁcantly
speedup some pre-deﬁned code fragments (Ahmad & Cheung, 2016; Ahmad et al., 2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.009950248756218905,"However, source-to-source translation for arbitrary programming languages is still an open problem.
Rule-based systems are commonly used, but they are never exhaustive due to the considerable num-
ber of translation rules that should be written to translate every function and object from every stan-
dard library. Unlike in natural languages, there is little to no parallel data available for source code,
making it impossible to train standard machine translation models. Recently, TransCoder (Roziere
et al., 2020) showed that unsupervised methods can be used to translate source code. However, it is"

As shown in Figure 1, it can confuse tokens that have different semantics in different languages, for

small inaccuracies often merely hinder comprehension in natural languages, they often make the
entire translation erroneous in the context of programming languages."

INTRODUCTION,0.07462686567164178,"Figure 1: Improvements over TransCoder. The ﬁrst function returns whether an input integer is odd and is
translated from Python to Java. The translation of TransCoder does not compile because the == operator has
precedence over & in Java, and parentheses are required unlike in Python. The second example is a function
that prints an integer in base two, which is translated from Java to Python. TransCoder translates does not
modify the expression x/=2, even though it corresponds to the integer division in Java and to the ﬂoat division
in Python. In the third example, a function reversing a char array, TransCoder does not manage to translate
the Java Stack object into the right Python object and uses the unsafe str parameter name. In all three cases,
TransCoder-ST manages to leverage the semantics contained in unit tests to translate the function correctly."
INTRODUCTION,0.07711442786069651,"TransCoder leverages back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2015), an effective data-augmentation
scheme where the model translates source sequences to generate training data for the target-to-
source direction, and vice versa. Although being highly effective in low-resource translation, back-
translation also has issues, as the model is trained on potentially invalid input-output pairs. Neural
machine translation models being highly sensitive to input noise (Belinkov & Bisk, 2018; Khayral-
lah & Koehn, 2018), this can severely deteriorate the performance. Fortunately, many programming
languages come with relatively mature tools and technologies for automated test data generation. In
this paper, we propose to leverage these tools to guide the translation process, weeding out unsuc-
cessful translations, thereby increasing the overall conﬁdence in the machine translation process."

engineering research community (Myers, 1979; Miller & Spooner, 1976). There are now many

2011; Lakhotia et al., 2013; Cadar et al., 2008), and production testing systems (Alshahwan et al.,

automated testing advances will lead to ongoing improvement in automated translation."

RELATED WORK,0.1044776119402985,"Unit Test Generation.
Software testing is challenging due to the large number of possibilities to
be tested, and the inherent cost of covering reasonable representative sample (Myers, 1979). When
test design is performed by humans, the cost can be prohibitive. To reduce such cost, much research
over the last three decades has focused on automating the process of test generation (Anand et al.,
2013). Although automated test generation has been studied since the mid-1970s (Miller & Spooner,
1976), it was only in the last decade that industrial-strength tools have become widely available.
There are now several test data generation tools for languages, including C (Cadar et al., 2008;
Lakhotia et al., 2013) and Java (Fraser & Arcuri, 2011). Popular test data generation techniques
include symbolic execution of the code (Cadar & Sen, 2013), dynamic execution guided by a ﬁtness
function (Harman et al., 2015), and hybrids of these two techniques (Baars et al., 2011). Recently,
neural networks have also been used successfully to generate unit tests (Tufano et al., 2020)."
RELATED WORK,0.10696517412935323,"One of the most well-established and widely-used open source tools for test data generation is the
EvoSuite system (Fraser & Arcuri, 2011). EvoSuite uses search based software engineering (SBSE)
(Harman et al., 2012) to generate test cases. Like all SBSE techniques, EvoSuite is guided by
ﬁtness functions, in this case aimed at capturing the test suite’s coverage and mutation score of the
code being tested. We use EvoSuite in our work for three reasons: it is publicly available in open
source (thereby facilitating replication), it is under current active development (thereby supporting
future work), and it is widely used by other researchers (thereby enabling interoperability). The test
framework can be considered as a parameter in our overall approach and could be substituted with
another."
RELATED WORK,0.10945273631840796,"In order to assess the effectiveness of the test suites generated, we use mutation testing, a topic also
widely-studied since the 1970s (DeMillo et al., 1978). A mutant is a version of the program into
which a fault is deliberately inserted, thereby assessing the test suite’s fault detection ability (Jia &
Harman, 2011; Papadakis et al., 2019). For a given set of mutants and a test suite, the mutation
score is deﬁned to be the proportion of mutants for which the test suite distinguishes the behavior
of the mutant from that of the original program. The mutation score is thus a proxy for the fault-
revealing power of the test suite on a set of simulated faults (the mutants). Mutation scores have been
empirically demonstrated to be correlated to real fault revelation (Chekam et al., 2017), motivating
our adoption of this approach."

Several studies used statistical methods to translate

from Python 2 to Python 3 (Aggarwal et al., 2015). Later, Chen et al. (2018) proposed a tree-to-tree
neural network to translate between CoffeeScript and JavaScript and between C# and Java using the
dataset created by Nguyen et al. (2013). However, these approaches are limited to a few language
pairs for which small parallel datasets were created manually (e.g. C#-Java) or can be created with
rule-based tools (e.g. Python 2-Python 3 and CoffeeScript-JavaScript)."

not require any parallel data or expert knowledge, and can easily be generalized to other languages.
They pre-trained their model with the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective of Devlin

back-translation (BT) (Sennrich et al., 2015) objectives. Later, Roziere et al. (2021) showed that

assessment metric in the literature (Jia & Harman, 2011), to pick out these test suites. The mutation
score is computed through mutation testing, in which mutants (i.e., program variants with syntactic
changes) are generated from the original program based on a set of transformation rules (more
details in Appendix A.2). A mutant is said to be killed if at least one test from the test suite has
different results on the mutant and the original program. Otherwise, the mutant is said to survive.
The mutation score is the ratio of killed mutants. A test suite with a higher mutation score checks
the code semantics more thoroughly. We adopt a strict strategy in test suite selection: we keep only

convergence. We can iterate this process by selecting the best checkpoints for Java →Python and

see no signiﬁcant improvements on the validation set."

With the online method, we create parallel examples on the ﬂy while training
the model. Compared to the ofﬂine method, it allows to always use the last model to generate new
examples and it is much more convenient to automate. However, this process can be unstable if
done naively. For instance, the model can start over-ﬁtting only a few examples and stop generating
anything that passes the unit tests for any other example. In order to stabilize the training, we follow
Likhomanenko et al. (2020) and implement a cache mechanism storing the previous examples that
passed the unit tests. At each step, the model can either train on parallel functions sampled from the
cache or create new parallel functions to add to the cache. When an example is sampled, we remove
it from the cache with a given probability. The online training allows the model to always beneﬁt
from the performance of the latest model and the cache mechanism ensures that the model does not
forget the correct examples that it was able to generate at previous time steps."

the code and typically correlate poorly with the correctness of the generated function, prompting the
use of new metrics checking if the generated solution passes series of test cases (Kulal et al., 2019;

new examples, train on them once and put them in the cache also with probability 0.5. The sampled

more samples that pass the unit tests but some of them are actually incompatible with the types
of translations expected by TransCoder (e.g. example with overﬂows in Figure 4), causing the

mance by more than 24% points, which corresponds to reducing the error rate by 35.7%. Examples
of avoided errors can be found in Figure 1 and Appendix B. Overall, all our models signiﬁcantly
improve previous results. As shown in Table 3, these improvements are stable across several beam
sizes and CA@n metrics. The CA@20 metric shows that the number of examples for which none
of the 20 elements in the beam are correct is reduced by more than 22% with online self-training. It
indicates that, even though we train only on the output of the model, our method does much more
than reordering the elements in the beam and allows the model to ﬁnd correct solutions that were
not assigned a high probability by the baseline model. See Table 6 in the appendix for more results."
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,0.26865671641791045,"Ablation study.
The results of our ablation study are shown in Table 4. Training online with no
cache makes the training much less stable. The model improves at the beginning of training and we
can select a few checkpoints where it performs well, but it ends up over-ﬁtting a few examples it
generated and the performance drops after a few epochs. Starting with an empty cache slows down
the training and hinders generalization, leading to a clear drop in performance. We also try removing
the minimum mutation score requirement for the model with no initial cache, which leads to even
lower scores as the model is trained partly on lower-quality parallel data."

of about two percentage points in average compared to our full model using beams of size 20. It
shows that initializing the cache of the model with beam size 20 is not sufﬁcient and creating new
examples with beam search is necessary to reach our best performance. Our full model provides
some improvements over the ablated versions for every language pair and direction, except over the
model trained with greedy decoding for Python →C++ translation. Evaluating with beam size 10
(still returning only the ﬁrst element) leads to some improvements for every language pair."
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,0.27860696517412936,"Limitations.
We found that the unit tests we create with this method are sometimes incompatible
with those of the test set of TransCoder, and that the capacity of a model to generate functions
that pass these unit tests is not perfectly correlated to its score on the test set. It raises the deeper
issue of deﬁning what constitutes a correct translation. For instance, most programmers would
translate a factorial function implemented with long integers into a factorial function implemented
with Python’s integer type. However, these functions are not semantically equivalent since the Java
implementation would return a negative number for the input 21 due to integer overﬂow while the
Python implementation would return 21! correctly. The human developers who wrote the parallel
functions in the test set of TransCoder often assumed that these functions would only be used on
a limited domain where no overﬂow occurs (see Figure 4). However, the test cases of EvoSuite
and TransCoder are not limited to this domain and they sometimes assert different semantics. By
using the test suites from EvoSuite as source of truth, we sometimes train the model to generate
translations that are more rigorous but also less natural."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.30597014925373134,"In this paper, we introduced a novel method to grow a parallel corpus for automated code translation,
from completely monolingual data. We leverage multilingual unit tests to ﬁlter good pseudo-labels,
improving the model, and in turn the candidate translations. We show that both ofﬂine and online
methods substantially improve the state of the art in unsupervised code translation, with an average
improvement of 12.6% points in computational accuracy, and up to 24% points for Python →C++,
corresponding to translation error rate reductions of 25.5% and 35.7% respectively, without using
any unit test generation tool for Python and C++ (exclusively for Java)."
CONCLUSION,0.30845771144278605,"Our method would automatically gain from improvements of automatic unit test generation tools.
We could also increase the size of the dataset we generate by using test creation tools written for
other languages in addition to Java, or by generating tests with EvoSuite on translated examples.
Similarly, we could also extract the semantics of human-written unit tests found in open-source
projects to obtain larger, and possibly higher-quality datasets. In this paper, we focused on transla-
tion correctness and our parallel example validation criterion was only based on semantics. It could
be supplemented with other requirements, such as a speciﬁc code formatting or the output of linters
to generate code verifying arbitrary criteria. Finally, the approach presented in this paper could eas-
ily be transferred to natural languages. Although there is no concept of unit tests in natural language,
traditional grammar and syntax checkers could be used to ﬁlter out some incorrect generations, and
reduce the noise coming from the back-translation process. Neural machine translation systems
being highly sensitive to noise coming from parallel data (Belinkov & Bisk, 2018; Khayrallah &
Koehn, 2018), this may improve the performance in low-resource machine translation signiﬁcantly."

machine-learning research."
CONCLUSION,0.31840796019900497,ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
CONCLUSION,0.3208955223880597,"In this paper, we improve source code translation methods. Our methods could facilitate codebase
migrations and interoperability, encouraging companies to move away from ancient programming
languages and making software developers more efﬁcient. Although increased efﬁciency could re-
duce the number of developers needed to perform a task, its impact on the labor market is unclear as
lower costs would also lower the bar for starting new projects and increase the demand for software
engineers. Today, the demand for software engineering skills is high despite (or thanks to) the devel-
opment of software (e.g. git, IDEs), programming languages (e.g. python), libraries (e.g. pytorch)
and methodologies (e.g. continuous deployment) improving the efﬁciency of software developers,
and we believe that the development of automatic translation tools would not drastically affect the
prospects of software developers either. In the long term, the migration of codebases written in anti-
quated programming languages (e.g. COBOL) could negatively impact experts in those languages,
who are in particularly high demand at the moment. However, it would also beneﬁt society by facil-
itating debugging and updating software still used in most of our ﬁnancial transactions and for many
government services, and by increasing the demand for other software engineering skills."

In the ﬁrst example computed the mini-
mum XOR between two elements of an array, TransCoder erroneously translates INT_MAX into
Integer.MIN_VALUE. This value is used in similar contexts (i.e. to compute a maximum in-
stead of a minimum) but is inappropriate here. TransCoder-ST manages to correct this and outputs a
function with the right semantics. In the second example, where the function computes the size of the
largest subset of elements of the list that could form a sequence of consecutive integers, TransCoder-
ST manages to translate the semantics of S.find(arr[i]-1)==S.end() appropriately while
TransCoder translates it into its negation."

10 element of the beam to be correct (i.e. CA@10). It can be explained by the fact that the tests
generated by EvoSuite on these functions can have low mutation scores and be insufﬁcient to thor-
