ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.003745318352059925,"Sparse Blind Source Separation (BSS) has become a well established tool for
a wide range of applications – for instance, in astrophysics and remote sens-
ing. Classical sparse BSS methods, such as the Proximal Alternating Linearized
Minimization (PALM) algorithm, nevertheless often suffer from a difficult hyper-
parameter choice, which undermines their results. To bypass this pitfall, we pro-
pose in this work to build on the thriving field of algorithm unfolding/unrolling.
Unrolling PALM enables to leverage the data-driven knowledge stemming from
realistic simulations or ground-truth data by learning both PALM hyperparame-
ters and variables. In contrast to most existing unrolled algorithms, which assume
a fixed known dictionary during the training and testing phases, this article further
emphasizes on the ability to deal with variable mixing matrices (a.k.a. dictionar-
ies). The proposed Learned PALM (LPALM) algorithm thus enables to perform
semi-blind source separation, which is key to increase the generalization of the
learnt model in real-world applications. We illustrate the relevance of LPALM in
astrophysical multispectral imaging: the algorithm not only needs up to 104 −105
times fewer iterations than PALM, but also improves the separation quality, while
avoiding the cumbersome hyperparameter and initialization choice of PALM. We
further show that LPALM outperforms other unrolled source separation methods
in the semi-blind setting."

INTRODUCTION,0.011235955056179775,"Blind source separation (BSS) : In a wide range of scientific domains, including remote sensing
(Dobigeon et al., 2013) and astrophysics (Picquenot et al., 2019), BSS is a very popular paradigm
aiming at finding physical decompositions of multi-valued data (Comon & Jutten, 2010). Specif-
ically, the data-set at hand is assumed to have been generated by a mixture of elementary signals,
called sources. Assuming a linear mixing model, this mathematically writes as"

INTRODUCTION,0.018726591760299626,"The objective of BSS is then to recover the unknown mixing A∗∈Rm×n and sources S∗∈Rn×t
matrices from the knowledge of the data set X ∈Rm×t only (and often despite the presence of
a Gaussian noise N ∈Rm×t). Unfortunately, it has long being emphasized that BSS is an ill-
posed matrix factorization problem (Comon & Jutten, 2010): merely minimizing a data-fidelity
term ∥X −AS∥2
F over A and S (with ∥.∥F standing for the Frobenius norm) often leads to spurious
estimates which are very different from the true underlying A∗and S∗matrices. As such, most
BSS approaches impose additional priors on the sought-after factors. Among them, sparsity has led
to some of the state-of-the-art results (Zibulevsky & Pearlmutter, 2001; Bobin et al., 2007; 2015;
Comon & Jutten, 2010). It amounts to tackling the following minimization problem:"

INTRODUCTION,0.04119850187265917,"the second one promotes sparsity while the last one – enforcing each column of A to be in the ℓ2
unit ball – enables to discard degenerated solutions (in which ||A||F →∞and ||S||F →0). In the
following, we will specifically focus on sparse BSS.
Being a difficult multi-convex problem, the optimization strategy is key to minimize (2). Among
the various iterative optimization algorithms that have been proposed so far, PALM (Attouch et al.,
2010; Bolte et al., 2014) is particularly appealing due to its mathematical guarantees (Xu & Yin,
2013) because it has been proved to converge to a critical point of (2). An iteration of PALM for
minimizing the cost function (2) consists in alternating the minimization with respect to S and A.
Specifically, at each iteration: i) a proximal gradient step of (2) is applied to update S while A is
fixed; ii) A is updated thanks to a proximal gradient step of (2) with S fixed. The process is then
repeated until the algorithm converges, see Section 2.
In the context of sparse BSS though, as highlighted in (Kervazo et al., 2020), PALM suffers from
severe limitations, especially due to the high sensitivity of the estimated factors with respect to
the choice of the regularization parameters. It is also emphasized in (Kervazo et al., 2020) that
the solution strongly depends on the initialization. Altogether, these flaws, which are confirmed in
our numerical experiments, undermine the results of PALM and limit its applicability in real-world
applications. Therefore, we propose to investigate how algorithm unrolling methods can bypass
these limitations. The general motivation is twofold : 1) introducing learned components within the
original PALM algorithm provides a data-driven regularization of the estimated A and S factors.
In particular, this can help to alleviate PALM difficult hyper-parameter choice. 2) Since (Kervazo
et al., 2020) emphasizes the high impact of the optimization strategy on A∗and S∗estimate quality,
learning some parameters of the gradient of (2) data-fidelity term is hoped to improve the results."
INTRODUCTION,0.0449438202247191,"Algorithm unrolling : Algorithm unrolling (Monga et al., 2021) was pioneered in (Gregor & Le-
Cun, 2010) for sparse coding. In our context, the sparse coding problem mostly corresponds to
non-blind source separation, in which A = A∗is known in (2). Quite similarly to PALM, such
a cost function is usually minimized through an iterative proximal gradient step algorithm, such
as the well known Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) (Daubechies et al., 2004;
Blumensath & Davies, 2008). Each ISTA iteration writes as:"

INTRODUCTION,0.08614232209737828,"Consequently, the resulting network, named Learned ISTA (LISTA), “unrolls” ISTA and truncates
it to K iterations. The appeal of unrolled algorithms is twofold. On the one hand, they yield better
estimates than iterative algorithms thanks to their higher representation power (Monga et al., 2021).
On the other hand, numerous empirical results (Sprechmann et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Zhang
& Ghanem, 2018; Zhou et al., 2018) show that they generalize well to unseen samples, thanks to
their interpretable structure.
Nevertheless, when the input distribution changes too much between the training and testing phases
(e.g., A∗changes, which is in particular the case in BSS), they often lead to impaired results as they
tend to (over-)fit the training set distribution. To make the network more robust with respect to small
changes in the dictionary A∗, it has been proposed to introduce small perturbations ϵA ∼N(0, σmax)
on the elements of the dictionary A∗during the training (Liu & Chen, 2019). Although such an
attempt might be beneficial in some sparse coding problems (Zhao et al., 2011), the dictionaries
vary much more in BSS because of the blind nature of the problem (and the variations might not be
Gaussian). In contrast, we propose in this work to use a tailored PALM-based unrolling structure to
account for the fact that A∗is unknown and might largely change in the training and testing phases."

RELATED WORKS,0.10112359550561797,"In source separation, algorithm unrolling has first been investigated for non-blind problems (Cowen
et al., 2019) in which A∗is known beforehand. For instance, (Qian et al., 2019) mostly unrolled
ISTA into the same architecture as (Gregor & LeCun, 2010) in order to perform non-blind Hyper-
spectral Unmixing (HSU). In the same context, (Zhou & Rodrigues, 2021) unrolled the ADMM
algorithm (Bioucas-Dias & Figueiredo, 2010). Recently, in an attempt to perform blind HSU, (Qian
et al., 2020) also unrolled ISTA to estimate S∗, but proposed to add an extra layer in the neural
network to learn A∗. The drawback is thus that the estimate ˜A is hard-coded in the network archi-
tecture, which is not well suited to the application on new hyperspectral images. Upon preparing
this work, we became aware of the very recent work of (Xiong et al., 2021), which proposes an un-
rolled architecture in order to account for the spectral variabilities in A∗. They use an unsupervised
cost function, which is a sum over the K layers of the network of the data set reconstruction error

RELATED WORKS,0.11235955056179775,"Such a loss is appealing as it does not require to know the ground truth factors A∗and S∗at training.
A huge drawback is that the reconstruction-based error has long been advocated to possibly lead to
spurious estimates, which are very different from the ground truth A∗and S∗factors (Comon &
Jutten, 2010; Zibulevsky & Pearlmutter, 2001; Gillis, 2020). Consequently, (Nasser et al., 2021)
rather added further priors on the sought after-factors in their unrolled algorithm cost function, at
the price of adding extra hyperparameters to be tuned by hand. Since they focus on unrolling the
multiplicative update (MU) algorithm (see also the earlier work of (Hershey et al., 2014) in this
context), their network structure is quite different from both (Xiong et al., 2021) and the algorithm
we investigate in this work.
Apart from the above articles, we would like to highlight that several works about unrolling methods
for related-to-BSS problems, such as dictionary learning (Tolooshams et al., 2020) or even Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (Arvinte et al., 2021), exist. However, as such problems have different purposes
and challenges, it is beyond the scope of this article to review them."

MOTIVATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS"
MOTIVATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS,0.1198501872659176,"As stated above, current source separation state-of-the-art lets the practitioner in an unsatisfactory
situation: 1) classical Blind source separation methods based on algorithms such as PALM are hin-
dered by a cumbersome hyperparameter choice. Until now, unsupervised unrolling-based methods
have felt short of solving such an issue: they often either lead to spurious solutions (as our numerical
experiments will highlight) or still require parameters to tune by hand. 2) Non-blind source separa-
tion (NBSS) intrinsically assumes A∗to be known and fixed during both train and test phases, which
is often unrealistic in practical experiments.
In this article, we propose to merge the best of both worlds by performing semi-blind source separa-
tion (SBSS). Specifically, practitioners usually have access to an imperfect knowledge of the mixing
matrix A∗, for instance by physics-derived simulators they might possess (which is in particular the
case in astrophysics) or by approximate ground-truths of signals/images of the same nature as the
ones they expect to observe (for instance, databases of spectra in remote sensing). The proposed
Learned-PALM (LPALM) algorithm gives a principled and easy way to leverage such an imperfect
knowledge to bypass the flaws of conventional sparse BSS algorithms. Specifically, the contribu-
tions of this article are:"
MOTIVATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS,0.12359550561797752,"• We unroll the PALM algorithm into the LPALM network, which is specifically tailored for
sparse SBSS and to cope with imperfectly known mixing matrices. In particular, in contrast
to usual unrolled algorithms such as LISTA (Gregor & LeCun, 2010) and LISTA-CP (Chen
et al., 2018), which do not alternate between A and S updates, LPALM better accounts for
the variability of the mixing matrix A∗which occurs in source separation problems.
• We experimentally highlight the limitations of current unsupervised unrolled BSS algo-
rithms: by leveraging the information contained within astrophysics simulations, LPALM
largely outperforms the networks of (Xiong et al., 2021; Qian et al., 2020; Nasser et al.,
2021) in terms of i) separation quality and ii) computation time. Compared to (Nasser"

tive, in contrast to the MU updates they use. This in particular enables to easily leverage
sparsifying transforms such as wavelets.
• We provide an in-depth comparative study between LPALM and PALM. Specifically, we
show that LPALM i) enables to automatically infer from the training set good regulariza-
tion hyper-parameters and initialization; ii) accelerates the estimation time up to 104 −105
times. Altogether, these are key properties to make source separation reliable in real appli-
cations."

On the other hand, the empirical success of LISTA has motivated several works on its theoretical
understanding (Moreau & Bruna, 2016; Giryes et al., 2018; Liu & Chen, 2019; Ablin et al., 2019).
Of particular interest to us, (Chen et al., 2018) proved an asymptotic coupling of LISTA weights.
Based on this, they derived a new architecture named LISTA-CP. In contrast to LISTA, using (4) as
an update, a layer of LISTA-CP is given by:"

LISTA-CP explicitly makes use of A∗and might thus in principle be better suited to deal with vari-
able mixing matrices, provided that A∗is known or at least decently estimated.
In Appendix D.1, we make a thourough experimental comparison between ISTA, LISTA, LISTA-
CP, and ISTA-LLT (defined in the same section) in the presence of mixing matrix variabilities in the
training and testing stages. These experiments confirm the insights described above : in a nutshell,
LISTA does not accelerate the estimation of S∗compared to ISTA for the same number of lay-
ers/iterations, and is also outperformed by LISTA-CP to a quite large extent, even when inaccurate
A∗are used in the updates. Consequently, our final choice is to opt for a LISTA-CP structure for ˜S

steps, which are the core of LPALM, LPALM can be applied on pre-processed data X. For instance,
in our realistic experiment of Subsection 3.2, we transformed X into the isotropic undecimated
wavelet domain (Starck et al., 2010). Specifically, the data X is decomposed into the so-called
coarse scale cX (i.e. large-scale approximation) and detail scales dX (i.e. fine-scale approximation).
LPALM is then applied on dX, which is sparser than cX. As such a pre-processing is customary in
sparse signal processing, and can be applied without loss of generality if the chosen wavelet domain
is orthogonal, it is omitted in the algorithm summary of the next subsection; see Appendix A for

Remark: A major difference between our approach and the previous BSS unrolled algorithms (Qian
et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021; Nasser et al., 2021) is the learning process itself. The latter are all

[1, N]} is chosen to be the training set, and the model is then tested on the entire matrix X. This is
due to the fact that problem (1) can be considered t sub-problems of the form: Xi = A∗Si∗+N i, i ∈
[1, t], with Xi ∈Rm×1, A∗∈Rm×n, Si∗∈Rn×1 and N i ∈Rm×1. In contrast, LPALM takes a
full matrix X as a training or testing instance. The data sets are thus sets of matrices, not vectors."

150 testing samples. The mixtures X = A∗S∗+ N are corrupted with a white Gaussian noise N
so that SNR = 30 dB. The spectra (i.e. the columns of A∗) have large variabilities over the data
set, see Figure 1. To mimic mildly sparse sources, the S∗∈R4×500 matrices are simulated using
generalized Gaussian distribution with a shape parameter β = 0.3 (which is usually a good proxy to
mimic the distribution of wavelet coefficients of natural images). In Subsection 3.2, the same A∗are
used, but the sources in the test set come from real data (Picquenot et al., 2019); see Appendix B."

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF PALM AND LPALM,0.30337078651685395,"In this section, we specifically focus on comparing the PALM and LPALM algorithms to show that
the latter enables to bypass PALM flaws. As emphasized in (Kervazo et al., 2020), the main pitfalls
of PALM lie in its high sensitivity to the initialization and to the regularization parameter choice.
On top of that, both are coupled, which makes PALM very hard to use in real-world applications.
The NMSE in Subsections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 is evaluated on the estimations ˜S of S∗."

initialization, of 0.176, is huge compared to its median. This makes PALM highly unreliable in
practice. On the contrary, LPALM obtained an NMSE of 0.0010 on the same sample. This means
that, although launched from a very generic (and much worse than the one of PALM) initialization,
LPALM managed to obtain better results than the best one of PALM."

LPALM OVERCOMES THE DIFFICULT HYPERPARAMETER CHOICE IN PALM,0.3408239700374532,"To try making PALM work in a realistic setting, we now infer both its initialization and regularization
parameter from the training set. We then compare its results to those of LPALM.
As above, PALM is initialized with a mixing matrix ˜A(0) taken at random from the training set,
and ˜S(0) = A†(0)X, where X is a data matrix from the test set to be factorized. However, the
λ hyperparameter is now chosen as the one minimizing the median NMSE between PALM source
estimate ˜Spred and S∗over the training set. It is thus the best regularization parameter, among the 30
values we tried, that can be chosen from the training set."
LPALM OVERCOMES THE DIFFICULT HYPERPARAMETER CHOICE IN PALM,0.3445692883895131,"Discussion: Figure 2(a) shows the results of PALM over the training set. Specifically, we see that
the best regularization parameter is λ = 2 × 10−3, for which PALM reaches a median NMSE of
8.72 × 10−3 in 1435 iterations. On the training set still, LPALM reaches better separation qualities
than PALM, which is expected as it has more capacity to benefit from the learning. Table 1 displays
the median results of both algorithms on the test set. Interestingly, LPALM generalizes well to
unseen samples and maintains much better results than PALM, with a difference of more than one
order of magnitude. As such, unrolling PALM enables to better leverage the knowledge of the
training set than applying PALM with a good initialization and the best λ value from the training
set. Furthermore, we highlight that LPALM requires about 80 times fewer iterations than PALM
(for the best λ value, otherwise the ratio can rise even much more), making it much more tractable
for large-scale data sets: on the test set, PALM required a median number of 2011 iterations, to
be compared with the 25 layers of LPALM. For the sake of exhaustiveness, we furthermore plot in
Figure 2(b) the evolution of the values of the NMSE across the layers of LPALM. It is interesting
to note that in this experiment, LPALM seems to exhibit a quite monotonic improvement of its
estimates over the layers, although this is not guaranteed and might not be the case for other data
sets."

In addition, we had to slightly modify the data set to be able to perform fair comparisons with

columns. To use them in the proper way, we therefore normalized the S∗matrix before applying
these methods. We furthermore point out that these unrolled networks (as well as DNMF) assume
the nonnegativity and sparsity of the sources in the same domain. The data are mildly sparse in
the pixel domain. In LPALM, a wavelet-based pre-processing, which is customary for SBSS, is
performed (see Appendix A for more details). Due to the non-negativity constraints for the other
methods, it was impossible to transform the X matrix in the wavelet domain when using them; they
are applied in the pixel domain.

of-art methods. This is due to the fact that LPALM enables to leverage the knowledge contained
within the whole training set (in particular, in the ground-truth), while the other methods only deal
with single images. Furthermore, DNMF is better than MNNBU and SNMF-net: this is probably
related to the fact that it uses a regularized cost function and not only the reconstruction error,
which is less likely to lead to spurious solutions. We further benchmarked LPALM with the LISTA
algorithm5. Although LISTA gives good results, it is largely outperformed by LPALM, which is
probably due to the alternating structure of the latter, enabling to better deal with large variations
over the A∗matrices. Said differently, LPALM performs much better in the semi-supervised setting
than LISTA."
APPLICATION TO REALISTIC DATA,0.3970037453183521,"We further assessed the generalization capacity of the four source separation methods. The second
line of the table shows the median NMSE when the same learned models are applied on the other
149 examples of the test set. These results show that the three tested state-of-the-art methods do not
generalize well to unseen samples. This is expected, as they are here trained on a single matrix and
thus cannot learn the A∗variabilities over the different matrices. This therefore demonstrates that the
proper way to deal with A∗variabilities with these networks is to re-train them for each new matrix
X: this might be impractical for real-life applications, due to the computational cost and the difficult
hyperparameter setting of some of them (learning rate schedule in particular). Lastly, the third line
of Table 2 shows, over 20 samples, the LPALM three competitors’ results when they are retrained
for each new input matrix X. Interestingly, even in this setting LPALM largely outperforms the
other methods, by almost two orders of magnitude. Therefore, not only LPALM does not need a
retraining for each new image (as it is not trained on a single image), but it furthermore gives much
better results than the other methods needing a retraining."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.4044943820224719,"In this article, we introduce LPALM, an unrolled version of the PALM algorithm tailored for solv-
ing sparse SBSS problems in the presence of variabilities of both generative factors A∗and S∗.
This is key to apply unrolled sparse SBSS algorithms to real-world, where the mixing matrix is
generally unknown but well constrained by the underlying physical phenomena. More precisely,
the chosen unrolling architecture is thoroughly justified by both methodological considerations and
experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in the field. In contrast to available unrolled
BSS methods that work in a purely unsupervised way without knowledge of the ground truth fac-
tors at training, the proposed LPALM algorithm provides significantly better solutions. Moreover,
we illustrate that LPALM yields very good generalization performances, enabling to bypass PALM
difficult initialization and regularization hyperparameter choice. Altogether, this makes LPALM a
good unrolling-based candidate to analyze real-world data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work using unrolling techniques for astronomical data, and we believe that it would open much
more perspectives to the introduction of such techniques in astronomy. Further research includes the
application of LPALM to other domains, such as remote sensing."

rithms such as LISTA-CP, as these require inside of their updates the knowledge of A∗; 2) LISTA does not
explicitly estimate the mixing matrix A∗but rather provides an estimation ˜S of the sources S∗. We therefore
resorted to an ISTA algorithm to obtain ˜A from ˜S and X."

standard deviation and shape parameter). These parameters are fitted to the tp non-zero
elements of each true reference source (t = 3000 is the total number of pixels and p is
the proportion of non-zero elements). Then a realization of tp samples of a GGD with
the estimated parameters is simulated, the resulting vector is concatenated with (1 −p)t
zero elements. Finally, a random shuffling is applied to the vector. The GGD parameters are
estimated from the histograms of non-zero elements of each source. This allows to simulate
random sources that have approximately the same statistics as the original astrophysical
sources in the wavelet domain. Such a simple process already enables to obtain a training
set that is decent enough to enable LPALM to have good results in the test phase."

LISTA parameters W1 and W2 might not be optimal for a given mixture X which was generated

As expected, the results of LISTA-CP and ISTA-LLT both deteriorate when noisy mixing matrices
are used within their updates (LISTA-CP (SNR = 10 dB) and ISTA-LLT (SNR = 10 dB) curves).
While the results of ISTA-LLT (SNR = 10 dB) become worse than ISTA, LISTA-CP (SNR = 10
dB) still gives better estimates than ISTA. The higher ability of the LISTA-CP architecture to deal
with noisy A∗estimate might be linked to a higher capacity of the network than ISTA-LLT, as there

be beneficial in experiments where A∗could be more difficult to learn (for instance, a larger matrix

LPALM SEPARATION RESULTS IN PRESENCE OF PARTIAL CORRELATIONS"

the results of LPALM when applied to the raw astrophysical data. These results are of reasonable
quality but show leakages that directly originate from the presence of these partial correlations.
Since the training set used to train LPALM does not contain such partial correlations, it cannot learn
an unmixing procedure that is robust to this type of artifacts. An in-depth comparison with other
unrolled algorithms in the presence of partial correlations, as well as properly tackling this issue
within LPALM, are left for future work."

The NMSE of LPALM output is plotted in figure 10 as a function of the number of layers K. As
can be seen from the plot, LPALM first better estimates the sources and the mixing matrices when
the number of layer increases, which is expected as the network representation power increases.
The best K, namely K = 50, is very low compared to the usual number of PALM iterations; see
Figure 2(a). Nevertheless, when K becomes too large, the separation quality decreases due to over-
fitting. In practice, choosing K values leading to over-fitting is easily avoided since the practitioner
can monitor the evolution of the validation loss, as is generally done."

Concerning the supervised cost functions we consider, all of them mostly obtain similar results. As
such, we used in this work the sum of the NMSE over A and S, which might be the most general one
as it does not put any emphasis on either term. According to the considered experimental setting,
the practitioner might nevertheless prefer another loss: for instance, it can be hinted that if one has
access to a good simulator for either A∗or S∗in the training phase, a loss adding more emphasis on
the corresponding term might lead to better results. More generally, investigating further the impact
of the loss function is left for future work."
