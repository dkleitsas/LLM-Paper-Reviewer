ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0022988505747126436,"Conventional supervised learning typically assumes that the learning task can be
solved by learning a single function since the data is sampled from a ﬁxed dis-
tribution. However, this assumption is invalid in open-ended environments where
no task-level data partitioning is available. In this paper, we present a novel su-
pervised learning framework of learning from open-ended data, which is modeled
as data implicitly sampled from multiple domains with the data in each domain
obeying a domain-speciﬁc target function. Since different domains may possess
distinct target functions, open-ended data inherently requires multiple functions
to capture all its input-output relations, rendering training a single global model
problematic. To address this issue, we devise an Open-ended Supervised Learning
(OSL) framework, of which the key component is a subjective function that allo-
cates the data among multiple candidate models to resolve the “conﬂict” between
the data from different domains, exhibiting a natural hierarchy. We theoretically
analyze the learnability and the generalization error of OSL, and empirically vali-
date its efﬁcacy in both open-ended regression and classiﬁcation tasks."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.006896551724137931,"A hallmark of general intelligence is the ability of handling open-ended environments, which
roughly means complex, diverse environments with no manual task speciﬁcation (Adams et al.,
2012; Clune, 2019; Colas et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). Conventional supervised learning typ-
ically assumes that the learning task can be solved by approximating a single ground-truth target
function (Vapnik, 2013). However, this assumption is invalid in open-ended environments where the
data may implicitly belong to multiple, disparate domains with potentially different target functions
since no manual task-level data partitioning is available. For instance, when collecting image-label
pairs from the Internet, an image of a red sphere can correlate with the label of both “red” and
“sphere”, implicitly representing two distinct domains or “metaconcepts” (Han et al., 2019): “color”
and “shape”. While being generic, this setting also characterizes many practical scenarios where the
data comes from multiple sources, contexts or groups: for example, in federated learning the data is
distributed on multiple clients, and in algorithmic fairness research the data is from different pop-
ulations. In these scenarios, the input-conditional label distribution may vary in different domains
(also referred to as concept shift (Kairouz et al., 2021)) due to personal preferences or other latent
factors, corresponding to different target functions."
INTRODUCTION,0.009195402298850575,"Since different domains may possess different target functions, training a single global model by
running Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) using all data is problematic due to the potential “con-
ﬂict” between the data from different domains: in the “red sphere” example above, directly training
on all data will lead to the unfavorable result of “50% red, 50% sphere”. Similar phenomena have
also been observed by prior works (Finn et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020), where a learner simultaneously
regressing from multiple target functions trivially outputs their mean. This indicates that the data
sampled from open-ended environments, which we refer to as open-ended data, exhibits a structural
difference from conventional supervised data. Formally, we introduce a novel, dataset-level measure
named mapping rank, which represents the minimal number of functions required to “fully express”
all input-output relations in the data and can be used to expound such difference more clearly."

F(r) such that for every (x, y) ∈Z, there exists f ∈F(r) with f(x) = y."
INTRODUCTION,0.01839080459770115,"Note that here we assume that there exist deterministic relations between inputs and outputs in the
same domain, which is generally a mild assumption and is satisﬁed in many practical applications.
Under Deﬁnition 1, conventional supervised data yields a mapping rank R = 1 as it assumes that
the whole dataset can be expressed by a single function. In contrast, open-ended data has a mapping
rank R > 1 since for the same input different outputs exist, manifested as the conﬂict between data
samples that renders training a single model problematic. Hence, it is natural to consider allocating
the data to multiple models, so that the data processed by each model has a mapping rank R = 1
and thus can be handled with ERM. Although in some scenarios, apart from data samples there also
exists side-information or metadata that can be exploited to identify the domains, this information
may be difﬁcult to deﬁne or collect in practice (Hanna et al., 2020; Creager et al., 2021); even
when such side-information is available, in many cases it still remains unclear how to leverage such
information to detect and resolve the potential conﬂict between domains. Therefore, the problem of
how to properly allocate open-ended data among the models is highly non-trivial."
INTRODUCTION,0.020689655172413793,"To tackle the aforementioned challenge, we present an Open-ended Supervised Learning (OSL)
framework to enable effective learning from open-ended data. Concretely, OSL maintains a set of
low-level models and a high-level subjective function that automatically allocates the data among
these models so that the data processed by each model exhibits no conﬂict. The term “subjective”
is used since in conventional supervised learning such allocation is manually performed during the
data collecting process and thus conforms to human subjectivity. The motivation of such process
is that if the subjective function yields an inappropriate allocation, i.e., assigning conﬂicting data
samples to the same model, then it will hinder the global minimization of the training error due
to the conﬂict, which in turn drives the subjective function to alter its allocation strategy. Using
a probablistic reformulation of OSL, we establish the connection between the data allocation and
the posterior maximization using a variant of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster
et al., 1977), and show that the optimal form of the subjective function can be explicitly derived."
INTRODUCTION,0.022988505747126436,"Theoretically, we respectively analyse the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learnabil-
ity (Valiant, 1984) and the generalization error of OSL. Using the tools from statistical learning
theory (Vapnik, 2013), we show that the relation between the number of low-level models and the
mapping rank of data plays a key role in the learnability of OSL, and the generalization error of
OSL can be decomposed into terms that respectively reﬂect high-level data allocation and low-
level prediction errors. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments including simulated open-
ended regression and classiﬁcation tasks to verify the efﬁcacy of OSL. Our results show that OSL
can effectively allocate and learn from open-ended data without additional human intervention. In
summary, our contributions are three-fold:"

PROBLEM STATEMENT"
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.041379310344827586,"We begin by introducing the notion of domain to formulate the generation process of open-ended
data. Inspired by Ben-David et al. (2010), we deﬁne a domain d as a pair ⟨P, c⟩consisting of a
distribution P on X and a deterministic target function c : X →Y, and assume that the open-ended
data is generated by a domain set D = {di}N
i=1 = {⟨Pi, ci⟩}N
i=1 containing N (agnostic to the
learner) domains. Each domain has its own sub-dataset Zi = {(xij, yij)}li
j=1 with cardinality li,
where xi1, · · · , xili are i.i.d. drawn from Pi and yij = ci(xij) . The whole dataset is the union of
these sub-datasets: Z = SN
i=1 Zi with cardinality l = PN
i=1 li and mapping rank 1 < R ≤N. We
then consider a bilevel sampling procedure: ﬁrst, m domain samples d1, · · · , dm are i.i.d. drawn
from a distribution Q deﬁned on D (the same domain may be sampled multiple times), resulting in
m sampling episodes; second, in each sampling episode n data samples are i.i.d. drawn from the
sub-dataset corresponding to the sampled domain. Hence, the dataset or any sub-datasets may be
sampled multiple times during training. This sampling regime is analagous to the bilevel sampling
process adopted by meta-learning. However, meta-learning usually assumes a dense distribution of
related domains to enable task-level generalization (Pentina & Lampert, 2014; Amit & Meir, 2018),
while OSL is compatible with scarce and disparate domains and inter-domain transfer is orthogonal."
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.04367816091954023,"As we have mentioned in Section 1, a single model is not sufﬁcient in this setting when R > 1. Thus,
we equip the learner with a hypothesis set H = {hi}K
i=1 consisting of K > 1 hypotheses, enhancing
its expressive capability. Although both N and K are assumed to be unknown, we will show that in
general K ≥R sufﬁces (Section 3.1), which eases the difﬁculty of setting the hyperparameter K."
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.04597701149425287,"In the above setting, an episodic sample number parameter n is introduced to maintain the local
consistency of data, implicitly assuming that we are able to sample a size-n data batch at a time from
each domain. While this formulation subsumes the fully online case of n = 1, we note that although
sometimes setting n = 1 works in practice, it also tends to be risky since it may raise difﬁculties in
controlling the generalization error, as we will both theoretically and empirically demonstrate in the
following sections (see Section 3.2 and Section 4.3)."

ence of mapping conﬂict: intuitively, a single model trained by conﬂicting data batches result in an
inevitable training error, thus hindering the minimization of the global error. This in turn facilitates
data allocation with less conﬂict. Given the empirical error 2, the corresponding expected global
error is

scenario where the learner interacts with only one domain in a particular time period (which is
natural in the real world), therefore its performance can be separately tested in all domains."

and a low-level model error that measures the accuracy of models, of which we provide detailed

LEARNABILITY"
LEARNABILITY,0.11954022988505747,"We ﬁrst analyze the learnability of OSL based on PAC learnability (Valiant, 1984). Since our
analysis directly applys to conventional supervised learning by setting K = 1, we also verify the
conﬂict phenomenon mentioned in Section 1 from a theoretical perspective. While the learnability
in conventional PAC analysis mainly relates to the choice of the hypothesis space, open-ended data
imposes a new source of complexity by its mapping rank, and we expect the cardinality of the
proposed hypothesis set can compensate this complexity. We consider the realizable case where
the hypothesis space covers the target functions in all domains, which helps to underline the core
characteristic of our problem. We begin by a result on the form of the optimal solutions of OSL.
Proposition 1 (Form of the optimal solutions). Assume that the target functions in all domains are
realizable. Then, the following two propositions are equivalent:"
LEARNABILITY,0.12183908045977011,"(1) For all domain distributions Q and data distributions P1, P2, · · · , PN, er(H) = 0."

LEARNABILITY,0.12643678160919541,"Proposition 1 suggests that minimizing the expected global error 3 with 5b elicits a global optimal
solution where every target function is learned accurately in the realizable case. Note that this does
not require N hypotheses for N domains, since non-conﬂict domains can be incorporated into the
same model. In other words, what determines the minimal cardinality of the hypothesis set is not the
number of the domains, but the number of conﬂicting domains, which can be exactly characterized
by the mapping rank. Formally, we attain a necessary condition of the PAC learnability of OSL.
Theorem 1 (Learnability). A necessary condition of the PAC learnability of OSL is K ≥R."
LEARNABILITY,0.12873563218390804,"Theorem 1 indicates that the cardinality of the hypothesis set should be large enough to enable
effective learning, and shows the impact of mapping rank on the learnability of OSL.
Remark 1. While it is generally hard to derive a necessary and sufﬁcient condition of PAC learn-
ability theoretically (which requires a sample-efﬁcient optimization algorithm), we empirically ﬁnd
that K ≥R is indeed an essential condition for learnability with complex hypothesis spaces (pa-
rameterized DNNs). We also note that several recent works (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Du et al., 2019)
have proved that over-parameterized neural networks trained by SGD can achieve zero training error
in polynomial time under non-convexity, which may also be used to enhance our analysis. We leave

if n →∞, in practice we ﬁnd that usually a very small n (e.g., n = 2) sufﬁces (see Section 4).
We posit that this is because the domains in our experiments are relatively diverse, thus reducing
the difﬁculty of discriminating between different domains. The domain estimation error term 7a
contains a domain-level complexity term VC( ¯S), and converges to zero if the number of episodes
reaches inﬁnity (m →∞); the instance estimation error term 7b contains sample-level complexity
terms VC(S), and converges to zero if the sample number in each episode or the number of episodes
reaches inﬁnity (n →∞or m →∞), showing the synergy between high-level domain samples and
low-level data samples in controlling the model-wise generalization error."
GENERALIZATION ERROR,0.19310344827586207,"Comparison with existing bounds. We compare our bound 7 with existing bounds of conventional
supervised learning (Vapnik, 2013; McAllester, 1999) and meta-learning (Pentina & Lampert, 2014;
Amit & Meir, 2018). Typically, supervised learning bounds contain a instance-level complexity term
as 7b, and meta-learning bounds further contain a task-level complexity term as 7a. Yet, conven-
tional supervised learning only considers a single domain or multiple known domains, while meta-
learning treats each episode as a new domain rather than domains that may have been encountered
as in OSL. Thus, none of these bounds contains an explicit inference term as 7c.
Remark 2. While our bound applies VC dimension as the complexity measure, extensions to other
data-dependant complexity measures such as Rademacher and Gaussian complexities (Bartlett &
Mendelson, 2002; Koltchinskii & Panchenko, 2000) is straightforward. It is worth noting that the
bounds based on these measures share the same asymptotic property w.r.t. m and n as in the bound 7."

SETUP AND BASELINES,0.23448275862068965,"Open-ended classiﬁcation. We consider two types of open-ended image recognition tasks where
the same image may correspond to different labels in different sample pairs. We refer to these tasks
according to the structure of their label spaces, namely parallel and hierarchical tasks. For parallel
tasks, we derive the data respectively from Colored MNIST, a variant of MNIST where each digit
is assigned with a digit label and a color label, and Fashion Product Images (Aggarwal, 2019), a
multi-attribute clothes dataset that involves 3 main parallel tasks including gender, category and
color classiﬁcation, as shown in Figure 1a; we construct open-ended datasets by randomly choosing
one label from the label set for each image. For the hierarchical task, we derive the data from
CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009), a widely-used image recognition dataset comprising 100
classes with “ﬁne” labels subsumed by 20 superclasses with “coarse” labels, as shown in Figure 1b;
we construct the open-ended dataset by randomly using the ﬁne or the coarse label for each image."
SETUP AND BASELINES,0.2367816091954023,"In classiﬁcation, the most relevant problem setting to OSL is multi-label learning (Zhang & Zhou,
2014), which considers the scenario where an input x is related with a label set y = {yi}N
i=1. This
setting is similar to OSL in terms that both OSL and multi-label learning considers the scenario
where the same input may relate to multiple labels. However, the key difference is that multi-label
learning requires that all labels in the label set are provided simaltaneously, while in OSL each data
sample only contains one label yi ∈y. Therefore, the setting of OSL can be alternatively modeled
as “multi-label learning with missing labels”, i.e., in each sample N −1 labels in y are missing and
only one label remains (note that this is a very extreme setting). Hence, we compare OSL with the
following baselines. (1) Probabilistic concepts (ProbCon): this baseline directly models the relation
between inputs and outputs using an conditional probability distribution (Devroye et al., 1996).
We adopt a single-model DNN to learn this probability distribution using the cross-entropy loss
and choose top-N labels as the ﬁnal prediction results. (2) Semi-supervised multi-label learning:
this class of methods model open-ended classiﬁcation as the problem of “multi-label learning with
missing labels” (Yu et al., 2014; Bi & Kwok, 2014; Huang et al., 2019), i.e., only one label in
each label set is available. We compare OSL with two representative semi-supervised methods:
Pseudo-label (Pseudo-L) (Lee, 2013) and Label propagation (LabelProp) (Iscen et al., 2019). We
also introduce two oracle baselines using additional information. (3) Full labels (Full-L): a standard
multi-label learning method where we provide the full label set for each image, hence there is no
missing labels. (4) Full tasks (Full-T): a standard multi-task learning method where the “task” of"

We compare the perfor-
mance of OSL and the baselines in Figure 2. Unsur-
prisingly, the vanilla baseline converges to a trivial
mean function (dashed curve in Figure 2a). MAML
successfully predicts the left part of all target func-
tions by ﬁne-tuning from episodic samples, but fails
in the right part where functions exhibit larger differ-
ence. We hypothesis that it is because meta-learning
typically requires tasks to be in sufﬁcient numbers,
and with more similarity.
Although Modular cur-
rectly predicts the general trend of the curves, its
predictions are still inaccurate in ﬁne-grained de-
tails.
Note that both meta-learning methods use
more episodic data samples than OSL (see Ap-
pendix D.3.1). Meanwhile, OSL with K ≥R (K =
3 or 4) successfully distinguishes different functions
and recover each of them accurately while OSL with
K < R (K = 2) fails, which matches our analysis
in Section 3.1. In particular, OSL with K = 4 automatically leaves one network to be redundant

the other hand, OSL with fewer episodic samples n = 1 induces a large subjective error 8, which
corresponds to the subjective estimation term in the generalization error 7c. Another interesting
phenomenon is that the curves in Figure 3b are partially swapped compared with the ground truth

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.31264367816091954,"Apart from the formulation in this paper, open-ended data may also be formulated using the frame-
work of multi-label learning with partial labels (Zhang & Zhou, 2014) or probabilistic density es-
timation, such as probabilistic concepts (Kearns & Schapire, 1994; Devroye et al., 1996) and the
energy-based learning framework (LeCun et al., 2006). A fundamental difference between these
formulations and OSL is that these methods learn a uniﬁed model, while our method explicitly en-
courages the learner to perform high-level data allocation and result in a set of independent models.
A recent work by Su et al. (2020) studies a similar problem as ours where the goal of the learner is
to learn from multi-task samples without task annotation. However, our work employs a different
objective function and our method has formal theoretical justiﬁcation."
RELATED WORK,0.31494252873563217,"Extensive literature has investigated the collaboration of multiple models (or modules) in completing

et al., 2018; Nagabandi et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). The difference between
our work and these works is that our multi-model architecture is driven by the inherent conﬂict in
open-ended data without manual alignment between models and tasks, and we only allow a single
low-level model to be invoked during a particular sampling episode."

DISCUSSION,0.3195402298850575,"An important open problem in machine learning is to move from highly specialized AI systems
to agents with more general abilities. While various viewpoints exist, the notion of open-ended
environments has been advocated by an increasing number of works (Goertzel & Pennachin, 2007;
Clune, 2019; Silver et al., 2021). In this work, we attempt to formalize this notion in the context of
supervised learning, and provide a general learning framework with theoretical guarantee. We hope
that our work can facilitate future research in this direction."
DISCUSSION,0.3218390804597701,"Limitations and future work. As mentioned in Section 1, our formulation is limited to the fully-
informative data where absolute predictions can be made given the inputs. While this assumption is
valid in a variety of applications, it is interesting to develop methods that can also handle data with
stochasticity. Other future work includes developing lifelong learning agents that beneﬁt from the
growing diversity of open-ended data as the sampling process continuously proceeds, and extending
our framework to other learning regimes, e.g., semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning."

inference time on the Fashion Product Images dataset. We measure the required wall-clock time
(in seconds) for each method to reach convergence during training as well as the averaged wall-
clock time for each method to predict all labels of one given input (in milliseconds). Concretely, for
OSL and all baselines except for two oracles (Full-L and Full-T), we train the models for 50 epochs
with about 15,000 images in every epoch; for Full-L and Full-T, we train for 10 epochs since these
methods generally converge faster. For each method, we test its total inference time on the same
3,000 test samples randomly sampled from the test set and report the mean inference time on each
test sample. All results are obtained with PyTorch using a NVIDIA 2080ti GPU."

LOG,0.9724137931034482,"As shown in the table, the time cost of OSL is generally on par with or lower than baselines that also
involve iterative training (Pseudo-L and LabelProp). Although the ProbCon baseline trains faster,
it learns a global model without the mechanism of data allocation and thus performs signiﬁcantly
worse than OSL as we have shown. Meanwhile, compared with the Full-T oracle that knows the
data-domain correspondences in advance, OSL only exhibits a little additional computational over-
head. This indicates that although OSL incorporates an extra data allocation process implemented by
the subjective function, this process only induces a limited computational cost since it only requires
additional network forward process without loss backpropagation, which is in general efﬁcient."

ITERATION PROCESS ON THE REGRESSION TASK"
LOG,0.9770114942528736,"In OSL, since the performance of the low-level models will impact the data allocation process of the
high-level subjective function, the training of the subjective function and low-level networks can be
regarded as an iterative process, as shown by Figure 6 with an example in open-ended regression,
in which the different colored lines are designated to different subjects. All networks are randomly
initialized, and in each iteration, each sample may be reallocated by the subjective function and used
to further train the low-level networks. With the increasing of iterations, both subjective and model
errors will reduce and converge along with the global loss. The last subﬁgure displays the ﬁnal
decision boundary of subjective function."

different feature spaces. Figure 7 displays the features output under all subjectives, where each color

Ensemble learning approaches typically employ multiple models to coopera-

The prediction of each model is combined by weighting (boosting), majority voting (bagging) or"

data (although sometimes with different sample weights), in ensemble learning there is typically
no explicit “hard” allocation process between the data and models. In contrast, the multi-model
architecture of OSL is driven by the inherent conﬂict in open-ended data, and each model only
handles a proportion of the whole dataset without overlapping."
LOG,0.9977011494252873,"Domain adaptation and domain generalization.
Domain adaptation (Ben-David et al., 2010;
Pan & Yang, 2010; Tan et al., 2018; Wang & Deng, 2018; Hoffman et al., 2018) and domain gen-
eralization (Blanchard et al., 2011; Muandet et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2021) consider the scenario
where the learner trained on one or multiple source domain(s) is transferred to one or multiple
new target domain(s). Typically, domain adaptation focuses on the problem where there exist some
labeled or unlabeled instances in the new domain, while domain generalization considers the setting
where there the information of the new domains is inaccessible during training (i.e., zero-shot gen-
eralization). In other words, these formulations focus on the adaptation or generalization capability
of the model on target domain(s). In contrast, OSL focuses on the multi-domain training process
and considers the scenario where directly training a global model using the data from multiple con-
ﬂicting domains is problematic, and aims to resolve this training issue by performing automatic data
allocation. Another important difference is that in domain adaptation and domain generalization the
data-domain correspondences are available, while OSL weakens this assumption by only assuming
that the data from each sampling episode is obtained from the same domain."
