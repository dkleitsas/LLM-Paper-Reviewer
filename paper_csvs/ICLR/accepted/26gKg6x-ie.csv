ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0018214936247723133,"We study the problem of aligning the supports of distributions. Compared to the
existing work on distribution alignment, support alignment does not require the
densities to be matched. We propose symmetric support difference as a divergence
measure to quantify the mismatch between supports. We show that select discrimi-
nators (e.g. discriminator trained for Jensen–Shannon divergence) are able to map
support differences as support differences in their one-dimensional output space.
Following this result, our method aligns supports by minimizing a symmetrized
relaxed optimal transport cost in the discriminator 1D space via an adversarial
process. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be viewed as a limit of
existing notions of alignment by increasing transportation assignment tolerance.
We quantitatively evaluate the method across domain adaptation tasks with shifts
in label distributions. Our experiments1 show that the proposed method is more
robust against these shifts than other alignment-based baselines."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.00546448087431694,"Learning tasks often involve estimating properties of distributions from samples or aligning such
characteristics across domains. We can align full distributions (adversarial domain alignment), certain
statistics (canonical correlation analysis), or the support of distributions (this paper). Much of the
recent work has focused on full distributional alignment, for good reasons. In domain adaptation,
motivated by theoretical results (Ben-David et al., 2007; 2010), a series of papers (Ajakan et al., 2014;
Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015; Ganin et al., 2016; Tzeng et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018; Pei et al., 2018;
Zhao et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018a; Wang et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2018) seek to align distributions of
representations between domains, and utilize a shared classifier on the aligned representation space."
INTRODUCTION,0.007285974499089253,"Alignment in distributions implies alignment in supports. However, when there are additional objec-
tives/constraints to satisfy, the minimizer for a distribution alignment objective does not necessarily
minimize a support alignment objective. Example in Figure 1 demonstrates the qualitative distinction
between two minimizers when distribution alignment is not achievable. The distribution alignment
objective prefers to keep supports unaligned even if support alignment is achievable. Recent works
(Zhao et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2019b; Tachet des Combes et al.,
2020) have demonstrated that a shift in label distributions between source and target leads to a
characterizable performance drop when the representations are forced into a distribution alignment.
The error bound in Johansson et al. (2019) suggests aligning the supports of representations instead."
INTRODUCTION,0.009107468123861567,"In this paper, we focus on distribution support as the key characteristic to align. We introduce a
support divergence to measure the support mismatch and algorithms to optimize such alignment. We
also position our approach in the spectrum of other alignment methods. Our contributions are as
follows (all proofs can be found in Appendix A):"
INTRODUCTION,0.01092896174863388,"1. In Section 2.1, we measure the differences between supports of distributions. Building on the
Hausdorff distance, we introduce a novel support divergence better suited for optimization,
which we refer to as symmetric support difference (SSD) divergence."

INTRODUCTION,0.01639344262295082,"2. In Section 2.2, we identify an important property of the discriminator trained for
Jensen–Shannon divergence: support differences in the original space of interest are “pre-
served” as support differences in the one-dimensional discriminator output space.
3. In Section 3, we present our practical algorithm for support alignment, Adversarial Support
Alignment (ASA). Essentially, based on the analysis presented in Section 2.2, our solution is
to align supports in the discriminator 1D space, which is computationally efficient.
4. In Section 4, we place different notions of alignment – distribution alignment, relaxed
distribution alignment and support alignment – within a coherent spectrum from the point of
view of optimal transport, characterizing their relationships, both theoretically in terms of
their objectives and practically in terms of their algorithms.
5. In Section 5, we demonstrate the effectiveness of support alignment in practice for domain
adaptation setting. Compared to other alignment-based baselines, our proposed method is
more robust against shifts in label distributions."

SSD DIVERGENCE AND SUPPORT ALIGNMENT,0.03825136612021858,"Notation. We consider an Euclidean space X = Rn equipped with Borel sigma algebra B and a
metric d : X × X →R (e.g. Euclidean distance). Let P be the set of probability measures on (X, B).
For p ∈P, the support of p is denoted by supp(p) and is defined as the smallest closed set X ⊆X
such that p(X) = 1. f♯p denotes the pushforward measure of p induced by a measurable mapping f.
With a slight abuse of notation, we use p(x) and [f♯p](t) to denote the densities of measures p and
f♯p evaluated at x and t respectively, implicitly assuming that the measures are absolutely continuous.
The distance between a point x ∈X and a subset Y ⊆X is defined as d(x, Y ) = infy∈Y d(x, y).
The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is defined as A △B = (A \ B) ∪(B \ A)."

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUPPORTS,0.04189435336976321,"To align the supports of distributions, we first need to evaluate how different they are. Similar to
distribution divergences like Jensen–Shannon divergence, we introduce a notion of support divergence.

into regions corresponding to the wrong class. In comparison, ASA does not enforce distribution
alignment and maintains good class correspondence across the source and target embeddings."
EXPERIMENTS,0.2495446265938069,"Main results. The results of the main experimental evaluations are shown in Tables 1, 2, 3. Without
any alignment, source only training struggles relatively to adapt to the target domain. Nonetheless, its
performance across the imbalance levels remains robust, since the training procedure is the same.
Agreeing with the observation and theoretical results from previous work (Zhao et al., 2019; Li et al.,
2020; Tan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2019b; Tachet des Combes et al., 2020), distribution alignment
methods (DANN and VADA) perform well when there is no shift but suffer otherwise, whereas
relaxed distribution alignment methods (IWDAN, IWCDAN and sDANN-β) show more resilience to
shifts. On all tasks with positive α, we observe that it is common for the existing methods to achieve
good class average accuracies while suffering significantly on some individual classes. These results
suggest that the often-ignored but important min-accuracy metric can be very challenging. Finally,
our support alignment methods (ASA-sq and ASA-abs) are the most robust ones against the shifts,
while still being competitive in the more balanced settings (α = 0 or 1). We achieve best results
in the more imbalanced and difficult tasks (α = 1.5 or 2) for almost all categories on all datasets.

Peng et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2016; Sun & Saenko, 2016) focusing on aligning some characteristics of
the distribution, such as first or second moments. Our work is concerned with a different problem,
support alignment, which is a novel objective in this line of work. In terms of methodology, our use
of the discriminator output space to work with easier optimization in 1D is inspired by a line of work
(Salimans et al., 2018; Genevay et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019a; Deshpande et al., 2018; 2019) on sliced
Wasserstein distance based models. Our result in Proposition 4.3 also provides theoretical insight on
the practical effectiveness of 1D OT in (Deshpande et al., 2019)."
RELATED WORK,0.26958105646630237,"Relaxed distribution alignment. In Section 4, we have already covered in detail the connections
between our work and (Wu et al., 2019b). Balaji et al. (2020) introduced relaxed distribution
alignment with a different focus, aiming to be insensitive to outliers. Chamfer distance/divergence
(CD) is used to compute similarity between images/3D point clouds (Fan et al., 2017; Nguyen et al.,
2021). For text data, Kusner et al. (2015) presented Relaxed Word Mover’s Distance (RWMD) to
prune candidates of similar documents. CD and RWMD are essentially the same as (5) with d(·, ·)
being the Euclidean distance. They are computed by finding the nearest neighbor assignments. Our
subroutine of calculating the support distance in the 1D discriminator output space is done similarly
by finding nearest neighbors within the current batch and history buffers."
RELATED WORK,0.27140255009107467,"Support estimation. There exists a series of work, e.g. (Schölkopf et al., 2001; Hoffmann, 2007;

Deecke et al., 2018; Zenati et al., 2018), on novelty/anomaly detection problem, which can be casted
as support estimation. We consider a fundamentally different problem setting. Our goal is to align
the supports and our approach does not directly estimate the supports. Instead, we implicitly learn
the relationships between supports (density ratio to be specific) via a discriminator."

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.2750455373406193,"In this paper, we studied the problem of aligning the supports of distributions. We formalized its
theoretical connections with existing alignment notions and demonstrated the effectiveness of the
approach in domain adaptation. We believe that our methodology opens possibilities for the design
of more nuanced and structured alignment constraints, suitable for various use cases. One natural
extension is support containment, achievable with only one term in (1). This approach is fitting for
partial domain adaptation, where some source domain classes do not appear in the target domain.
Another interesting direction is unsupervised domain transfer, where support alignment is more
desired than existing distribution alignment methods due to mode imbalance (Binkowski et al., 2019)."

DISCUSSION OF “SOFT” AND “HARD” ASSIGNMENTS WITH 1D DISCRETE
DISTRIBUTIONS"
Z,0.8123861566484517,"In Section 4.2 we considered the “soft-assignment” relaxed OT problem (11) and claimed that for
integer β, the set of minimizers of (11) must contain a “hard-assignment” transportation plan, meaning
γij ∈{0, 1}, ∀i, j. Below we justify this claim."
Z,0.8142076502732241,"Note that for β = 0 the OT problem (11) is the standard OT problem for Wasserstein-1 distance (10),
since the inequality constraints Pm
i=1 γij ≤1, ∀j can only be satisfied as equalities. For this problem,
it is known (e.g. see Peyré et al. (2019) Proposition 2.1) that the set of optimal “soft-assignment”
contains a “hard-assignment” represented by a normalized permutation matrix. This fact can be
proven using the Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem. The Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem states that
the set of doubly stochastic matrices"

linear program (11) with β = 0, the Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem means that all extreme points
of the polyhedron Γβ(op, oq) are hard-assignment matrices. Therefore, by the fundamental theorem
of linear programming (Bertsimas & Tsitsiklis, 1997), the minimum of the objective is reached at a
“hard-assignment” matrix."
Z,0.8233151183970856,"We argue that a similar result holds for the case of integer β > 0. In this case, the matrices in
Γβ(op, oq) can not be associated with the doubly stochastic matrices, since constraints on of the
marginals of γ are relaxed to inequality constraints. Because of that, the Birkhoff–von Neumann the-
orem can not be applied. However, Budish et al. (2009) provide a generalization of the Birkhoff–von
Neumann theorem (Theorem 1 in (Budish et al., 2009)) which applies to the cases where the equality
constraints are replaced with integer-valued inequality constraints (recall that we consider integer β).
Using this generalized result, our claim can be proven by performing the following steps."
Z,0.825136612021858,"Clearly, the polyhedron Γβ(op, oq) contains all “hard-assignment” matrices and all their finite convex
combinations. The result proven in (Budish et al., 2009) implies that each element of Γβ(op, oq) can
be represented as a finite convex combination of “hard-assignment” matrices. Thus, the polyhedron
Γβ(op, oq) is exactly the set of all finite convex combinations of “hard-assignment” matrices and
all extreme points of the polyhedron are “hard-assignment” matrices. Finally, by analogy with the
case of β = 0, we invoke the fundamental theorem of the linear programming and conclude that the
minimum of the objective (11) is reached at γ corresponding to a “hard-assignment” matrix."

all methods across all imbalance levels: with λent = 0.1 the accuracy either improves (especially
the average class accuracy) or roughly stays on the same level. The relative ranking of distribution

HISTORY SIZE EFFECT AND EVALUATION OF SUPPORT DISTANCE"

different sizes of history buffers on USPS→MNIST task with the label distribution shift α = 1.5.

of the learned discriminator at the end of the training. While without any alignment objectives
neither the densities nor the supports of gψ

Z and gψ
♯qθ
Z are aligned, both alignment methods
approximately satisfy their respective alignment constraints. Compared with DANN results, ASA
with small history size performs similarly to distribution alignment, while all history sizes are enough
for support alignment. We also observe the correlation between distribution distance and target
accuracy: under label distribution shifts, the better distribution alignment is achieved, the more target
accuracy suffers. Note that with too big history buffers (e.g. n = 5000), we observe a sudden drop
in performance and increases in distances. We hypothesize that this could be caused by the fact
that the history buffer stores discriminator output values from the past steps while the discriminator
parameters constantly evolve during training. As a result, for a large history buffer, the older items
might no longer accurately represent the current pushforward distribution as they become outdated."
