ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.003436426116838488,"Recently, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has become one of the
most popular Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods successfully applied in
supervised learning (SL). However, its applications in other domains, in particular
for reinforcement learning (RL), has seldom been studied. This is due in part to
RL possessing a signiﬁcantly different optimization paradigm than SL, especially
with regards to the notion of replay data, which is continually generated via
inference in RL. In this paper, we introduce RL-DARTS, one of the ﬁrst applications
of end-to-end DARTS in RL to search for convolutional cells, applied to the
challenging, inﬁnitely procedurally generated Procgen benchmark. We demonstrate
that the beneﬁts of DARTS become ampliﬁed when applied to RL, namely search
efﬁciency in terms of time and compute, as well as simplicity in integration with
complex preexisting RL code via simply replacing the image encoder with a
DARTS supernet, compatible with both off-policy and on-policy RL algorithms.
At the same time however, we provide one of the ﬁrst extensive studies of DARTS
outside of the standard ﬁxed dataset setting in SL via RL-DARTS. We show that
throughout training, the supernet gradually learns better cells, leading to alternative
architectures which can be highly competitive against manually designed policies,
but also verify previous design choices for RL policies."

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION"
INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.010309278350515464,"Over the last decade, recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning have heavily focused on
algorithmic improvements (Hessel et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016), data augmentation (Raileanu
et al., 2020; Kostrikov et al., 2020), infrastructure upgrades (Espeholt et al., 2018; Horgan et al.,
2018), and even hyperparameter tuning (Zhang et al., 2021; Faust et al., 2019). The automation
of such RL methods have given rise to the ﬁeld of Automated Reinforcement Learning (AutoRL).
Surprisingly however, one relatively underdeveloped and unexplored area is automating large-scale
policy architecture design."
INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.013745704467353952,"Recently, works in larger-scale RL suggest that designing a policy’s architecture can be just as
important as the algorithm or quality of data, if not more, for various metrics such as generalization,
transferrability, and efﬁciency. One surprising phenomenon found on Procgen (Cobbe et al., 2020),
a procedural generation benchmark for RL, was that “IMPALA-CNN”, a residual convolutional
architecture from (Espeholt et al., 2018), could substantially outperform “NatureCNN”, the standard
3-layer convolutional architecture used for Atari (Mnih et al., 2013), in both generalization and sample
complexity under limited and inﬁnite data regimes respectively (Cobbe et al., 2019). Furthermore, in
robotics subﬁelds such as grasping (Kalashnikov et al., 2018; Rao et al., 2020), cameras collect very
detailed real-world images (ex: 472 x 472, 4x larger than ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015)) for
observations which require deep image encoder architectures, consisting of more than 15 convolutions,
raising concerns on efﬁciency and speed in policy training and inference. As such RL policy networks
gradually become larger and more sophisticated, so does the need for understanding and automating
such designs."
INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.01718213058419244,"Many efﬁcient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods utilize the one-shot setup, where only
one set of shared weight parameters is trained through an ensemble of models, otherwise known
as a supernet. Differentiable Architecture Search (Liu et al., 2019), trains the supernet by inserting
architecture selection variables inside the network in a continuous relaxation approach, in order to be
differentiable with respect to a loss. These architecture search parameters are then used to select a
ﬁnal discretized perception module to be retrained from scratch in an evaluation phase."

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.024054982817869417,"The differentiable aspect of DARTS is highly attractive to RL, which possess two complications
which SL does not:"
INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.027491408934707903,"1. RL is an entire system. In most RL algorithms involving auto-differentiation, there are
multiple different phases: a collection/exploration phase which collects environment data
via forward passes/inference of a policy, in addition to a training phase which updates
parameters for potentially multiple network components (e.g. both the policy and value
function in policy gradient methods). There can also even be a separate evaluation phase
(disjoint from evaluation in NAS) different from the collection phase (e.g. using argmax
greedy evaluation instead of the stochastic actor, for both Q-learning and policy gradient
methods). Such phases are also commonly distributed over different machines, adding an
extra layer of complexity via inter-machine communication."
INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.030927835051546393,"2. RL training curves possess considerably more variance and noise than SL curves, with
a much larger room for error due to sensitivity to hyperparameters (Andrychowicz et al.,
2020), which originally led to the criterion of reporting mean and standard deviation for
3 seeded runs (Henderson et al., 2018). In fact, this noise can be nearly unbounded, as in
many cases, an unlucky and catastrophic seeded training run can simply lead to a trivial
reward even with an optimal architecture. Such noise may potentially be problematic for
fast convergence for blackbox/evolutionary optimization methods. Furthermore, the RL loss
contains important information not conveyed by just pure reward (e.g. value function
error and entropy penalty, as well as potentially exploration/novelty bonuses), whereas
information may be lost when simply summarizing all progress to a single scalar point of
data."
INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.03436426116838488,"DARTS solves (1) as it integrates naturally within the RL system with minimal modiﬁcations to
the code and pipeline, by simply replacing the image encoder in standard RL algorithms. For
(2), architecture search parameters in the DARTS supernet are joint trained alongside weight
parameters, and can thus also use information from multiple auxiliary losses, which can be
much richer signals than potentially sparse rewards.
We represent this approach in Figure 1."

DARTS supernet is simply inserted into the network
components of a standard RL training pipeline, which
may potentially be highly distributed."
INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.06872852233676977,"However, since there has been no previous proof
of DARTS’s feasibility in standard RL, one
may hypothesize a few subtle concerns. While
DARTS in SL is simpler and can focus more
on generalization, a core major challenge in RL-
DARTS is the feasability of training the supernet
itself due to a non-stationary data distribution.
This is especially because using a differentiable
loss (ex: Bellman error) as the search objective
is a double-edged sword in RL, as loss is deﬁned
with respect to the replay buffer, whose data
is collected by the policy itself via inference
on the architecture. In SL, the data distribution
is independent of the architecture, and the loss
(e.g. cross-entropy or negative log-likelihood)
is strongly correlated or even equivalent to the objective (e.g. accuracy or density estimation (Parmar
et al., 2018)). However in RL, a bad architecture could lead to a poor initial distribution of data,
and thus a local optimum where the loss is zero while the policy is still poor. This is inherently
due to the fact that the data in the replay buffer may not sufﬁciently cover the state and action space
of the entire environment, and is common in cases such as sparse reward problems. This issue occurs
even if the replay buffer data is ﬁxed, which is the basis of ofﬂine RL (Levine et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.07216494845360824,"The other question occurs during the discretization phase of DARTS, as any continuous relaxation
method must deal with integrality gaps when rounding back to a discrete space, with this gap
dependent on the optimization landscape. At the core of multiple discretization procedures (Liu
et al., 2019; Chu et al., 2020c; Hundt et al., 2019) lies the idea of op selection based on edge weights.
However, RL’s optimization landscape is signiﬁcantly different (Ilyas et al., 2020; Ahmed et al.,
2019) from SL, and thus even if the supernet trains in RL, it is unclear if e.g. DARTS’s default
discretization procedure leads to a better discrete cell, which is the original goal of DARTS
and NAS in general."

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.07903780068728522,"In this paper, we carefully analyze the extent at which DARTS can optimize perception modules
for RL environments. While there is a rich series of active study on the theoretical and empirical
behavior of DARTS optimization in SL (Wang et al., 2021b; Chen & Hsieh, 2020; Li et al., 2021),
our work is one of the ﬁrst to study its optimization in RL, a completely different paradigm.
Through extensive experiments, we ultimately validate that even vanilla DARTS is capable of
architecture search in RL, laying a core foundation for future work in NAS for RL. In summary,
our contributions are:"
INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.08247422680412371,"• We demonstrate DARTS can be integrated with existing RL algorithms in a minimally
invasive and easy-to-use manner, agnostic to the speciﬁc pipeline. Remarkably, on the
challenging Procgen benchmark featuring inﬁnite data, the DARTS supernet is able to train
from scratch and efﬁciently produce similar training curves as baselines using both on-policy
(PPO) and off-policy (Rainbow) methods, both of which require inference on the network."
INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.0859106529209622,"• Due to the common issue of integrality gaps between supernet cells and discrete cells, we
verify both qualitatively via visualizations and quantitatively via rewards, that discretized
cells start with suboptimal architectures and gradually evolve to better architectures. How-
ever, we also demonstrate how this can fail, especially if the corresponding supernet fails to
train, with further extensive ablations in the Appendix."
INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION,0.08934707903780069,"• By evaluating the ﬁnal discrete cells at the end of supernet training, we discover that many
environments beneﬁt from learned, custom-tailored architectures, suggesting that human-
designed architectures can be suboptimal. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that joint-training a supernet
on multiple environments can potentially produce a single transferrable cell. This opens up
questions for future study, as large-scale RL can potentially beneﬁt from more applications
of NAS techniques."

For NAS on RL, these include (Song et al., 2021; Gaier & Ha, 2019; Stanley & Miikkulainen, 2002;
Stanley et al., 2009) which utilize CPU workers for forward pass evaluations rather than exact gradient
computation on GPUs. Such methods are usually unable to train policies involving more than 10K+
parameters due to the sample complexity of zeroth order methods in high dimensional parameter
space (Agarwal et al., 2010). However, such methods have proved useful on smaller search spaces
for RL, such as hyperparameter optimization (Zhang et al., 2021; Franke et al., 2020; Parker-Holder
et al., 2020; Jaderberg et al., 2017) and algorithm search/“learning to learn” methods (Faust et al.,

DARTS is (Akinola et al., 2021), which searches for the optimal way of combining the observation
and action tensors together in off-policy QT-OPT (Kalashnikov et al., 2018). However, this approach
does not modify the image encoder nor uses the supernet for inference, as off-policy robotic data
collected independently from the actual policy is used for training, which leaves the applicability of
DARTS to inference-dependent RL as an open question addressed in our work."

surfaces: Can any supernet train? The supernet possesses an incredibly dense set of weights, and
thus one might wonder whether trainability occurs with any search space or settings. We answer
in the negative, where a poorly designed supernet can fail. To show this clearly, we remove all
ReLU nonlinearities from the “Classic” search space used for PPO (although ReLUs still exist in
ﬁnal MLP projections), as well as simply freeze α to be uniform for Rainbow, and ﬁnd both cases
produce poor training in Table 2. Thus, the supernet in RL provides important search signals in
terms of reward and α during training, especially on the quality of a search space."

see, the performance generally improves over time, indicating that
supernet optimization selects better cells. However, we ﬁnd that
such behavior can be environment-dependent, as some environments
possess less monotonic evaluation curves (see Figure 16 in Appendix
C)."
DISCRETE CELL IMPROVEMENT,0.30927835051546393,"One reason why a discretized cell may underperform is if its cor-
responding supernet fails to learn. One simple reason is due to
the inherent sensitivity and variance in RL training. For example, in
Figure 7, we see that when using Rainbow, bad training setups (ex: setting D too high) can create
an unlearnable “Supernet 2”, subsequently leading to an unlearnable corresponding discrete cell,
while the inverse occurs with “Supernet 1” and its own discrete cell. The discrete cells’ rewards can
also be qualitatively explained (ex: see Figure 7’s caption). We perform further studies in Appendix

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.38144329896907214,"Our research has demonstrated that in a minimally invasive way, it is entirely possible to apply DARTS
to RL, a completely different optimization paradigm than SL, which DARTS was originally proposed
for. We believe this work can open new doors to both NAS and RL communities alike. Especially for
theorists and analysts of DARTS, RL is a completely new frontier for which to understand softmax
routing and continuous relaxation techniques. Previous DARTS techniques (Wang et al., 2021b;
Chu et al., 2020a; Liang et al., 2019) may be tested in the RL setting, and new RL-speciﬁc ways of
discretization and training may also be proposed, increasing RL-DARTS’s utility even more. For
RL practitioners, RL-DARTS could be important to ﬁnding better and more efﬁcient (Cai et al.,
2019) architectures for large-scale robotics (James et al., 2019; Akinola et al., 2021), transferable
architectures in ofﬂine RL (Levine et al., 2020), as well as RNNs for memory (Pritzel et al., 2017;

ETHICS STATEMENT,0.3917525773195876,"Ethics Statement:
The only relevant potential concerns in our work occur normally with general NAS
methods, which can sacriﬁce model interpretability in order to achieve higher objectives. For the ﬁeld of RL
speciﬁcally, this may warrant more attention in AI safety when used for real world robotic pipelines. Furthermore,
as with any NAS research, the initial phase of discovery and experimentation may contribute to carbon emissions
due to the computational costs of extensive tuning. However, this is usually a means to an end, such as an
efﬁcient search algorithm, which this paper proposes with no extra hardware costs."

space details in Subsection 4.1. The original DARTS implementation is readily available across Github
(e.g. https://github.com/quark0/darts) as it is a highly popular algorithm. Similarly, Procgen is
publicly available (https://github.com/openai/procgen) along with its training code and details
(Cobbe et al., 2020). For our case, we used TF-Agents for PPO, available at https://www.tensorflow.
org/agents and Acme for Rainbow, available at https://github.com/deepmind/acme. Since our
algorithm is relatively simple to assemble given preexisting pipelines, we believe that our approach should
require minimal effort to reproduce."
REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT,0.4020618556701031,"In terms of comparing NAS methods, we indeed controlled for confounding factors by using the same hardware,

remain the same (16 for supernets, 64 for discrete cells, and D = 3 layers for cheaper large-scale runs or D = 5
for ﬁne-grained A/B testing). In terms of performance comparisons over time, we showed the performance of
RL-DARTS’s discrete cells over the search procedure / supernet training in Figure 6. We extensively covered the
comparisons against random search in Subsection 4.4, over all 16 games as well as a large scale 100 random cell
comparison in Figure 9. For seeded runs, as standard in RL, we performed 3-seeded runs for all experiments."

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS TO RL-DARTS"
REFERENCES,0.738831615120275,These include:
REFERENCES,0.7422680412371134,"1. Discretization Changes: One may consider discretization based on the total reward J(πθ,α),
which may provide a better signal for the correct discrete architecture. This is due to the
fact that the relative strengths of operation weights from α may not correspond to the best
choices during discretization. (Wang et al., 2021b) considers iteratively pruning edges from
the supernet based on maximizing validation accuracy changes. For RL, this would imply a
variant of discretization dependent on multiple calculations of J(πθ∗,δ1(α∗))−J(πθ∗,δ2(α∗))
where θ∗consists the weights obtained during supernet training, as well as ﬁne-tuning
J(πθ∗,δ1(α∗)) at every pruning step. These changes, in addition to the inherently noisy
evaluations of J(·), greatly increase the complexity of the discretization procedure, but are
worth exploring in future work."
REFERENCES,0.7457044673539519,"2. Changing the Loss / Regularization: Throughout this paper, we have found that vanilla
DARTS is able to train by simply optimizing α with respect to the loss, even though in
principle, the loss is not strongly correlated to the actual reward in RL. Thus, it is curious to
understand whether loss-based metrics or modiﬁcations may help improve RL-DARTS. One
such modiﬁcation is based on the observation that certain RL losses may not be required
for training α. In PPO, the entropy loss of πθ may not be necessary or useful for improving
the search quality of α, and thus it may be better to perform a two step update by providing
a different loss for α. One may also consider searching for two separate encoders via two
supernets, since both PPO and Rainbow feature separate networks, e.g. the policy πθ1,α1
and value function Vθ2,α2 for PPO and advantage function Aθ1,α1 and value function Vθ2,α2
for Rainbow."

Hessian with respect to α throughout training, i.e. ∇2
αL(θ, α) as found in (Zela et al., 2020).

the mentioned metrics must be deﬁned with respect to the current replay buffer D, and thus
raises the question of what type of data is to be used for calculating these metrics. When

by the environment used as well as integrality gaps between the continuous relaxation

improving the supernet training leads to better discrete cell performances. In any case,
reasonable methods of improving the supernet can involve DARTS-agnostic modiﬁcations
to the RL pipeline, including data augmentation (Kostrikov et al., 2020; Raileanu et al.,
