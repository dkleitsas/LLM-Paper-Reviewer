ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.004149377593360996,"We introduce the maximum n-times coverage problem that selects k overlays
to maximize the summed coverage of weighted elements, where each element
must be covered at least n times. We also define the min-cost n-times coverage
problem where the objective is to select the minimum set of overlays such that
the sum of the weights of elements that are covered at least n times is at least
τ. Maximum n-times coverage is a generalization of the multi-set multi-cover
problem, is NP-complete, and is not submodular. We introduce two new practical
solutions for n-times coverage based on integer linear programming and sequential
greedy optimization. We show that maximum n-times coverage is a natural way
to frame peptide vaccine design, and find that it produces a pan-strain COVID-19
vaccine design that is superior to 29 other published designs in predicted population
coverage and the expected number of peptides displayed by each individual’s HLA
molecules."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.012448132780082987,"In the maximum n-times coverage problem, a set of overlays is selected to cover elements zero or
more times, where each overlay is predetermined to cover one or more elements. Each element is
assigned a weight that reflects its importance. The objective of the problem is to maximize the sum
of the weights of elements that are covered at least n times by at most k overlays. When the coverage
of elements by overlays is determined by a machine learning method, the result summarizes machine
learning results with a compact solution that is shaped by the element weights employed."
INTRODUCTION,0.016597510373443983,"Our introduction of weighted elements and required n-times coverage creates a new class of problem
without a known solution or complexity bound for approximate solutions. The closest problem
to the maximum n-times coverage problem is the multi-set multi-cover problem which does not
assign weights to the elements and thus can be formulated as the Covering Integer Program (CIP)
problem (Srinivasan, 1999). Thus like CIP, maximum n-times coverage is NP-complete. A log(n)-
time approximation algorithm for CIP can violate coverage constraints (Dobson, 1982; Kolliopoulos,
2003; Kolliopoulos & Young, 2001). Deletion-robust submodular maximization protects against
adversarial deletion (Bogunovic et al., 2018; Mirzasoleiman et al., 2017) and robust submodular
optimization protects against objective function uncertainty (Iyer, 2019), but neither guarantees that
each element is covered n times."
INTRODUCTION,0.02074688796680498,"In this work, we investigate properties of the maximum n-times coverage problem, provide a practical
solution to the problem, and use the solution for machine learning based vaccine design. We show that
maximum n-times coverage is not submodular, and introduce NTIMES-ILP and MARGINALGREEDY,
efficient algorithms for solving the n-times coverage problem on both synthetic data and real vaccine
design. In our framing of vaccine design, an element is a specific collection of HLA alleles (a
genotype), weights are the frequency of genotypes in the population, n is the desired number of
peptides displayed by each individual, and an overlay is a peptide that is predicted to be displayed
by each genotype a specified number of times. The solution of the maximum n-times coverage
problem allows us to find a set of overlays that maximizes the sum of element weights (population
coverage). We show that framing vaccine design as maximum n-times coverage produces a solution
that produces superior predicted population coverage when compared to 29 previous published
vaccines for COVID-19 with less than 150 peptides."

may become intractable for problems where hundreds of thousands of elements and/or overlays are
involved, such as certain variants of the vaccine design problem. Thus, we seek a polynomial time
algorithm that provides good solutions to the maximum n-times coverage problem. A naive greedy
solution is problematic when the n-times objective is directly approached. This is a consequence
of potential early bad overlay choices by a greedy approach that can cause it to fail later to find
overlays with sufficient n-times coverage. In addition, during greedy optimization available overlay
choices may not provide differential marginal gain to avoid ties and random overlay selection. The
MARGINALGREEDY algorithm is specifically designed to avoid early bad choices that will lead to
failure by marginally approaching the n-times coverage objective. MARGINALGREEDY preserves
marginal gains by employing look-ahead tie-breaking that assists in selecting overlays that benefit
longer term objectives."

problem with cardinality constraint k, the optimization terminates when t > k. When beam search is
not used to reduce computation time (b = 1), we have extended the algorithm to break ties during the
n-times coverage iteration by looking ahead to (n + 1)-times coverage. We call this extension look
ahead tie-breaking. Another advantage of MARGINALGREEDY is that it is capable of guaranteeing
high coverage for nt < ntarget by controlling the cycle-specific coverage cutoffs τt. This is desired
in vaccine design where wider population coverage is also important and we want to make sure that
almost 100% of the population will be covered at least once."

shows the efficiency of the NTIMES-ILP and MARGINALGREEDY algorithms on both the n-TIMES
SET COVER and MAXIMUM n-TIMES COVERAGE problems for varying values of n. We compare
our algorithms to a greedy algorithm that directly optimizes n-times coverage and find the greedy
algorithm degenerates to sub-optimal solutions for large values of n. These sub-optimal solutions can
be as bad as random. We also compute the true optimal solution with exponential-time exhaustive
search. We repeated problem generation and optimization with 6 different random seeds to provide
confidence bounds and used beam size b = 1 with look-ahead tie-breaking for MARGINALGREEDY.
As shown in Figure 2, NTIMES-ILP achieves true optimal in all datasets and MARGINALGREEDY
outperforms greedy on all tasks and datasets. We observed that MARGINALGREEDY has a significant
advantage over greedy in tests with larger n and in regions of higher coverage. Appendix D contains

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.45643153526970953,"We introduced the maximum n-times coverage problem, and showed that it is not submodular. We
presented both a novel ILP based method and a beam search algorithm for solving the problem, and
used them to produce a peptide vaccine design for COVID-19. We compared the resulting optimized
peptide vaccine designs with 29 other published designs and found that the optimized designs provide
substantially better population coverage for both MHC class I and class II presentation of viral
peptides. The use of n-times coverage as an objective increases vaccine redundancy and thus the
probability that one of the presented peptides will be immunogenic and produce a T cell response.
We are presently testing our pan-strain COVID-19 vaccine in mouse challenge studies for protection
against a COVID variant of concern. Our pan-strain vaccine delivers MHC class I and class II n-times
coverage optimized epitopes with a single mRNA-LNP construct. Our methods can also be used to
augment existing vaccine designs with peptides to improve their predicted population coverage by
initializing the algorithm with peptides that are present in an existing design. We provide an open-
source implementation of our methods at https://github.com/gifford-lab/optivax."

EVALUATION OF OPTIVAX-ROBUST VACCINE DESIGN AND BASELINES
WITH NON-EXPERIMENTALLY-CALIBRATED MACHINE LEARNING
PREDICTIONS"
REFERENCES,0.9294605809128631,"We found that OPTIVAX produced vaccine designs superior to the baselines we tested even when it
used immunogenicity models that did not rely upon clinical data of peptide immunogenicity. Since
our immunogenicity model used experimental data that was not accessible to the baseline methods,
our designs have an advantage over baseline vaccines that did not use calibrated machine learning
predictions. We repeated vaccine design using an ensemble of NetMHCpan-4.0 and MHCflurry with
50 nM predicted affinity cutoff for predicting MHC class I immunogenicity and NetMHCIIpan-4.0
for MHC class II. As shown in Figure S1, OptiVax-Robust again shows superior performance on all
metrics at all vaccine size under 35, indicating the success of MARGINALGREEDY in optimizing
population coverage with diverse peptide display."

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON A DATASET WITH UNEQUAL WEIGHTS AND
SPARSE COVERAGE"
REFERENCES,0.941908713692946,"We further expanded our evaluation to include a hill climbing based method and a more complex
dataset. We generated a dataset named LARGE with sparse overlay coverage and unequal element
weights to provide a further basis of comparison for n-times coverage methods. The LARGE dataset
was created by generating a set of 30 overlays to cover a set of 10 elements with unequal weights,
and the probability of covering an element 0, 1, or 2 times is 0.6, 0.3, and 0.1, respectively. We
added an additional baseline method using hill climbing with random restarts for comparison with
other methods. For hill climbing we used stochastic local search that queries a randomly selected
subset of neighbors (Algorithm 2). We used stochastic local search because for a solution size of
k, a single exhaustive local search step requires querying all possible solutions that are 1 peptide
different from the current solution, which may result in k× #_total candidate_peptide queries to
the oracle that computes n-times population coverage. This approach is too expensive in typical
vaccine design problems with thousands of candidate peptides. For a fair comparison we have set
the number of restarts and hill climbing steps such that the total number of oracle queries needed to
build a hill climbing solution of size k is equivalent to that of MarginalGreedy. Figure S2 shows that
hill climbing is effective when the solution size is small, and but fails to reach 100% coverage when
MarginalGreedy reaches 100% coverage. MarginalGreedy and True Optimal reach 100% coverage"
