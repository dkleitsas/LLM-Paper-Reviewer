ABSTRACT,0.0021691973969631237,"Gradient estimation is critical in zeroth-order optimization methods, which aims to
obtain the descent direction by sampling update directions and querying function
evaluations. Extensive research has been conducted including smoothing and linear
interpolation. The former methods smooth the objective function, causing a biased
gradient estimation, while the latter often enjoys more accurate estimates, at the
cost of large amounts of samples and queries at each iteration to update variables.
This paper resorts to the linear interpolation strategy and proposes to reduce the
complexity of gradient estimation by reusing queries in the prior iterations while
maintaining the sample size unchanged. Specifically, we model the gradient estima-
tion as a quadratically constrained linear program problem and manage to derive
the analytical solution. It innovatively decouples the required sample size from the
variable dimension without extra conditions required, making it able to leverage
the queries in the prior iterations. Moreover, part of the intermediate variables that
contribute to the gradient estimation can be directly indexed, significantly reducing
the computation complexity. Experiments on both simulation functions and real
scenarios (black-box adversarial attacks neural architecture search, and parameter-
efficient fine-tuning for large language models), show its efficacy and efficiency.

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.006507592190889371,"Zeroth-order optimization (ZO) aims to estimate the gradients by only function evaluations and
solve optimization problems by the descent method. It has been successfully applied to many fields,
including science [41, 25], finance [35], and artificial intelligence [37, 45, 47], where the optimization
functions are usually black-box without available gradients w.r.t. the variables. Typical ZO methods
iteratively perform three major steps [35]: 1) estimate the gradient by sampling directions to update
the variable and querying the function evaluation, 2) rectify the descent direction through momentum,
element-wise sign operation, stochastic variance reduced algorithms, etc., and 3) update the variables
according to the descent direction. Wherein, the first step, i.e. gradient estimation, is critical since
it provides the essential direction to update variables, which have been explored by many recent
works [5, 30]."
INTRODUCTION,0.008676789587852495,"Gradient estimation methods in ZO can be roughly categorized into two groups [5]: linear interpo-
lation technique [4, 30] and smoothing strategy [39, 12]. The former proposes to sample a set of
linearly independent directions to form an invertible matrix and compute the gradient through linear
interpolation. Though such methods can get better descent directions, the sample size of directions
should be the same as the dimension of variables, leading to an intractable complexity of building an
invertible matrix and computing the matrix inversion as the dimension increases. A recent work [30]"

INTRODUCTION,0.013015184381778741,"makes the sample size in linear interpolation strategy independent of the dimension of variables yet
involves an extra orthogonal requirement of the sampled vectors. The latter group proposes to estimate
the gradient by a sum of directional derivatives along random directions e.g. Gaussian and uniform on
a unit sphere. Such methods are simple to implement and the sample size directions are independent
of the variable dimension. However, it provides a gradient estimation of a smoothed version of
the objective function [35], which differs from the original one with a bound w.r.t. a smoothing
parameter [39]. Additionally, the prior work [5] shows that smoothing methods require significantly
more samples than linear interpolation strategies to obtain an accurate estimation The work [28]
leverages information theory showing that under the Lipschitz continuous gradient assumption, ZO
methods require sample complexities growing polynomially with the variable dimension."
INTRODUCTION,0.015184381778741865,"Overall, the prior gradient estimation methods require large amounts of samples at each iteration
to update variables. Nevertheless, in many real scenarios, one query of function evaluation can
require large amounts of resources such as tasks in AutoML and reinforcement learning, which
significantly restricts the acceptable sample size at each iteration and thus slow down the convergence
of ZO methods. Consequently, it has been urgently demanded to reduce the number of queries while
ensuring the convergence of ZO methods."
INTRODUCTION,0.01735357917570499,"To this end, we delve into the ZO pipeline and observe that the magnitudes of steps to update variables
are limited, making it possible to reuse the queries in the prior iterations. It is hoped that such a
reusing strategy can be explored to significantly reduce the number of queries of function evaluation
while maintaining the sample size unchanged at each iteration. However, it is hard to be directly
applied to the prior gradient estimation methods. On one hand, for smoothing strategies, it is hard to
guarantee the reused samples obey the demanded distribution, which will further increase the gradient
estimation bias. On the other hand, methods based on linear interpolation techniques require a large
computation complexity since building an invertible matrix needs to compute the null space of reused
samples. Additionally, another work [30] requires orthogonal sampled vectors, which can hardly be
satisfied by the prior samples, making it impossible to reuse the samples."
INTRODUCTION,0.019522776572668113,"This work refers to Taylor’s expansion and proposes to estimate gradients through a linear combination
of limited direction samples and their queried function evaluations. We then model the gradient
estimation as a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP) and derive the analytical solution.
Our method can reduce the required sample size (decoupled from the variable dimension) for linear
interpolation strategies without the orthogonal condition required. Consequently, it supports to reuse
the queries in the prior iterations. Moreover, part of the intermediate variables that contribute to the
gradient estimation can be directly indexed from the computation in the prior iterations, significantly
reducing the computation complexity during the ZO process. Theoretical analysis is performed to
show that our method can be regarded as a general version of the traditional linear interpolation
strategy and has a similar convergence rate. In summary, our contributions lie in:"
INTRODUCTION,0.021691973969631236,"1) We introduce to reuse the prior queries to speed up the ZO procedure. Unlike recent works
that cannot reuse the queries due to the requirements of sampled vectors to be orthogonal in linear
interpolation strategies or obey a specific distribution in smoothing techniques, we introduce to
estimate the gradient with an arbitrary number of sampled vectors without orthogonal condition,
making it possible to leverage the queries in the prior iterations. To the best of our knowledge, this
work is the first that attempts to reuse queries to speed up the ZO procedure."
INTRODUCTION,0.02386117136659436,"2) We model the gradient estimation in ZO as a QCLP and derive the analytical solution by
Lagrange multiplier. Theoretical analysis also proves that our method has a similar convergence rate
as conventional linear interpolation techniques. Moreover, after combining our gradient estimator
based on QCLP with the reusing strategy, part of the intermediate variables that contribute to
the analytical solution can also be directly indexed from the computation in the prior iterations,
significantly reducing the complexity when the sample size is much lower than the variable dimension.
Overall, our method is more efficient than linear interpolation-based methods with a comparable
accurate estimation of the gradient."
INTRODUCTION,0.026030368763557483,"3) We conduct extensive experiments to show the efficacy and efficiency of our method. We first
compare our method with recent ZO methods on the CUTEst, showing that it has faster convergence
speed and better solutions. Ablation studies show that the performance drop is negligible even with
more than 50% reuse rate. We then conduct experiments on the black-box adversarial attack task,
showing that it has lower attack loss and 5% better attack success rate compared to peer ZO solvers"

RELATED WORK,0.03253796095444685,"Zeroth-order optimization. There are typically two types of gradient estimation in ZO algorithms:
one-point estimation [38, 13, 54] and multi-point estimation [1, 39, 22, 19]. Since multi-point
estimation is more accurate, some works [33, 52] made further research on ZO convex problems. As
for the non-convex setting, the prior works [39, 22] proposed ZO-GD and its stochastic counterpart
ZO-SGD. ZO algorithms have been widely employed in various scenarios, such as black-box
adversarial attacks [11, 27], AutoML [47] and transfer learning [44]. It is worth noting that the
gradient estimation is the most critical part of ZO solvers, which is the focus of the above methods."

prior smoothing strategy based ZO algorithms [39, 22], ZO-signSGD [34] yields faster convergence
but only guarantees to converge to a neighborhood of a solution, and ZO-AdaMM [12] uses adaptive
momentum to enhance the optimization."
RELATED WORK,0.0368763557483731,"Gradient estimation via linear interpolation. Methods based on linear interpolation [15, 4] estimate
gradient by solving linear programming. Conn et al. [15] derived the error bounds between the true
function value and interpolating polynomials, including linear and quadratic approximation models.
Berahas et al.[4] showed that linear interpolation gives better gradients than Gaussian smoothing in
derivative-free optimization. The prior work [5] derived bounds on the sample size and the sampling
radius, showing that smoothing strategy requires significantly more samples to obtain an accurate
estimation than linear interpolation. Kozak et al.[30] approximated the gradient by finite differences
computed in a set of orthogonal random directions, which is a special case of linear interpolation.
This work also focuses on the scope of linear interpolation due to its more accurate estimation of
gradient than smoothing techniques."

train the operation weights by the SGD optimizer and train the architecture parameters by the ZO
optimizer for 50 epochs on the CIFAR10 dataset. To query the performance of one sampled direction,
we update the architecture parameters by the direction and return the loss after training the operation
weights for 10 iterations. The accuracy of discovered architectures on three datasets is directly
indexed from the benchmark. For each ZO optimizer, we conduct three replication experiments and
report the averaged accuracy and standard deviation in Table 2. We observe that our method surpasses

the whole search process and the search time in Table 3. Our method is much faster than other ZO

EXPERIMENTS ON PARAMETER EFFICIENT FINE-TUNING,0.34490238611713664,"This work handles gradient estimation in zeroth-order optimization by modeling it as a quadratically
constrained linear program problem, with analytical solution derived via the Lagrange multiplier
method. Our method ReLIZO, decouples the required sample size from the variable dimension
without the requirement of orthogonal condition in the recent linear interpolation works, making it
possible to leverage the queries in the prior iterations. We also show that part of the intermediate
variables contributing to the gradient estimation can be directly indexed, significantly reducing the
computation complexity. We further perform a theoretical analysis of the convergence of ReLIZO
and show the relationship with the prior linear interpolation methods. The efficacy and efficiency
have been shown in extensive experiments, including simulated benchmarks, NAS, and black-box
adversarial attack tasks."
EXPERIMENTS ON PARAMETER EFFICIENT FINE-TUNING,0.3470715835140998,"Limitations and Future work. Compared to the gradient-based methods, ZO methods require
multiple queries of function evaluation at each iteration, which restricts their applications in real-
world scenarios such as neural network training. Our ReLIZO can reduce the required number of
queries by the reusing strategy, potentially broadening the scope of applications of ZO, which can be
explored in future work. However, in cases where the consumption of one query is negligible, the
profit due to the reusing technique decreases, causing a relative increase in the cost of solving the
QCLP. We leave these problems in future work."
EXPERIMENTS ON PARAMETER EFFICIENT FINE-TUNING,0.3492407809110629,Impact Statements
EXPERIMENTS ON PARAMETER EFFICIENT FINE-TUNING,0.351409978308026,"This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. Note that zeroth-
order optimization is an effective method for black-box adversarial attacks as we have shown in
Section 4.3. Its purpose is to evaluate the robustness of machine learning models, but we should also
be aware of the impact this may have on AI safety. There are many potential societal consequences
of our work, yet none of which we think must be specifically highlighted here."

n −nk vectors are newly sampled. The computation complexity includes two parts: querying
function evaluations for newly sampled vectors, and computing gradient estimation by Eq. 5. For
the former, we denote the complexity of querying function evaluation once as O(c(d)), where c(·)
could be linear, polynomial, etc.. Then querying n−nk times requires O((n−nk)c(d)) computation
resources. As for the latter, Eq. 5 requires to compute Axk with complexity O((n −nk)nd), the
inverse of matrix Axk with complexity O(n3), and the matrix multiplication of ∆⊤

surpasses other baselines. We analyze that the methods based on smoothing strategy utilize Monte
Carlo sampling to estimate the expectation of various directional derivatives and a small N will lead
to a biased estimation as shown in [5]. In contrast, our ReLIZO computes the projection of gradient
on a space generated by arbitrary numbers of sampled directions by solving the QCLP, and thus can
also work pretty well under a small N."

best learning rate for each optimizer for different tasks. The best solution obtained by each optimizer
are reported in Table 7, and the values in the brackets report the gap between each baseline and
ReLIZO. The results show that the improvement of ReLIZO is increasing as d increases for each

Additional Experimental Results on the Reusable Distance Bound b"
ZK,0.8806941431670282,"In Fig. 5, we observe a relative performance drop (slightly slower convergence) when the reusable
distance bound b ≥η. However, this does not imply that the reuse strategy is ineffective in this case.
The ARGTRIGLS problem is characterized by a rugged landscape with numerous local minima.
In this case, as shown in Fig. 4(b), even with b = η and a sample size n = 8, the reuse rate of
ARGTRIGLS exceeds 90%, whereas reuse rates for other problems are generally below 50% (e.g.
MANCINO with d=100 in Fig. 4(a), SROSENBR with d=500 in Fig. 2(b)). This high reuse rate
indicates that the number of new queries during optimization is relatively small, contributing to the
observed decrease in convergence speed. To address this issue, we can employ simple strategies
such as reducing the reusable distance bound b. Table 10 illustrates that performance improves as b
decreases."

CLAIMS,0.8980477223427332,1. Claims
CLAIMS,0.9002169197396963,"Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims are clearly presented in the abstract and introduction, and are
further elaborated and substantiated throughout the subsequent sections of the paper.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9023861171366594,"• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.9045553145336226,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Refer to Sec.5.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.9067245119305857,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs"

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.9219088937093276,Answer: [Yes]
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.9240780911062907,"Justification: In our paper, we provide detailed descriptions of each step of the algorithm,
the pseudocode, and all settings required to replicate the experiments. Additionally, we
commit to making the code publicly available by the time of the camera-ready submission."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.9262472885032538,Guidelines:
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.928416485900217,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results."

material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Open source upon acceptance.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9349240780911063,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).

Justification: Refer to Sec.4.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9436008676789588,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9457700650759219,"• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources"

of experiments are provided.)
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9501084598698482,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This paper conforms, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9544468546637744,"• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

10. Broader Impacts"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9566160520607375,"Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Refer to Sec.5.
Guidelines:"
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9587852494577006,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations."
OPEN ACCESS TO DATA AND CODE,0.9609544468546638,"• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."

SAFEGUARDS,0.9674620390455532,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.9696312364425163,Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
SAFEGUARDS,0.9718004338394793,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9739696312364425,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
