EUCLIDEAN GRAPH ISOMORPHISM TESTS,0.4662698412698413,"invariant by construction. The challenge is proving the other direction. To this end, let us assume
that CG(X) = CG(Y ), and assume without loss of generality that r := rank(X) ≥rank(Y ). Note
that X has rank r ≤3, and so it must contain some three points whose rank is also r. By applying
a permutation to X we can assume without loss of generality that these three points are the first
three points. The initial coloring C0(1, 2, 3)(X) of this triplet is their Gram matrix (⟨xi, xj⟩)1≤i,j≤3,
which has the same rank r as the space spanned by the three points. Next, since CG(X) = CG(Y )
are the same, there exists a triplet of points i, j, k such that C(1)(1, 2, 3)(X) = C(1)(i, j, k)(Y )
which implies that the initial colorings are also the same. By applying a permutation to Y we can
assume without loss of generality that i = 1, j = 2, k = 3. Next, since the Gram matrix of x1, x2, x3
and y1, y2, y3 are identical, there is an orthogonal transformation that takes xi to yi for i = 1, 2, 3,
and by applying this transformation to all points in X we can assume without loss of generality that
xi = yi for i = 1, 2, 3. It remains to show that the rest of the points of X and Y are equal, up to
permutation. To see this, first note that X and Y have the same rank since"
