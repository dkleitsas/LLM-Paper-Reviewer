ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0032679738562091504,"Protecting the privacy of user data is crucial when training neural text generation
models, which may leak sensitive user information during generation. Differentially
private (DP) learning algorithms provide guarantees on identifying the existence of
a training sample from model outputs. PATE is a DP learning algorithm that fits
large models well, such as GPT. In this paper, we propose SeqPATE that adapts
PATE to text generation while satisfying DP. There are two key challenges in
adapting PATE to text generation: (i) obtaining sequence-level supervision for text
generation, and (ii) reducing noise required to protect the privacy given a large
output space (i.e. vocabulary size). For (i), we generate pseudo input and reduce
the sequence generation problem to the next word prediction. For (ii), we reduce
the output space with top-k and top-p selection strategy that dynamically filters the
candidate words; and we refine the teacher aggregation of PATE to avoid the low
agreement rates due to voting over the large output space. To limit the privacy loss,
we design an efficient knowledge distillation to reduce the frequency of distilling
from the private data. We apply SeqPATE to a simple text generation task (sentence
completion) and achieve 39% and 28% gains in Bleu4 on two datasets."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.00980392156862745,"Recent work showed that sensitive user information in training corpora, such as address and name, can
be extracted from text generation models (Carlini et al., 2019; 2020). Providing privacy guarantees to
the text used to train text generation models has become a critical problem. Differential privacy (DP)
provides provable guarantees against the identification of individuals in the dataset. Deep learning
models with DP guarantees ensure the existence of a specific training sample cannot be detected."
INTRODUCTION,0.013071895424836602,"The most popular DP algorithm for deep learning is Noisy-SGD (Song et al., 2013; Bassily et al.,
2014; Abadi et al., 2016), which adds noise to the gradients. However, the advantage of NoisySGD
is weaken as the model becomes larger (Yu et al., 2020), and NoisySGD requires a per-example
gradient clip, which causes non-convergence and system overheads (Zhu et al., 2020; Bu et al., 2021).
Applying Noisy-SGD to large text generation models (e.g. GPT-2) requires additional tricks such
as memory reduction (Li et al., 2021) and advanced fine-tuning strategies (Yu et al., 2021). PATE
(Papernot et al., 2017) is a DP learning model using a teacher-student framework: a student accessing
non-sensitive data distills knowledge from the aggregated predictions of multiple teachers trained
on sensitive data. Calibrated noise is added to the aggregated predictions to satisfy DP. PATE can
handle large models since its privacy cost derives from the knowledge distillation instead of the model
parameters. PATE takes advantage of non-sensitive data which is also available in our scenario."
INTRODUCTION,0.016339869281045753,"In this paper, we propose, SeqPATE, a DP learning algorithm for text generation that exploits both
sensitive and non-sensitive data by knowledge distillation. Specifically, we adapt PATE for text
generation. The adaptation is challenging due to the sequential generation and the large output
space (i.e. vocabulary size) in text generation. Firstly, to obtain the sentence-level supervision for
text generation, directly applying PATE needs to roll out all teachers to produce a sentence (i.e. all
teachers must vote to generate a word, which is then used as the input for the next word prediction).
Running inference for a large number of teachers can be costly. Secondly, the large output space
results in (i) low agreement rate among teachers and (ii) large noise required by DP, both would
significantly hurt task performance."

INTRODUCTION,0.02287581699346405,"To avoid sequential generation, we generate pseudo data using a pre-trained language model such
that teachers only need to provide token-level supervision given the pseudo input. To handle the large
output space, we aggregate teachers’ outputs by interpolating their output distributions instead of
voting with argmax predictions. To reduce the noise scale, we propose strategies to dynamically
filter candidate words that only keep words with large probabilities. Further, we design an efficient
knowledge distillation strategy that only queries the teacher when the student has poor performance."
INTRODUCTION,0.026143790849673203,"We evaluate our method on sentence completion, a simple but representative task of text generation.
Compared to baselines including Noisy-SGD (Kerrigan et al., 2020), SeqPATE improves Bleu4 by
39% and 28% on two datasets with meaningful privacy protection 1. We observe SeqPATE works
particularly well under relatively strong privacy protection (e.g., ε ≤2) compared to Noisy-SGD. Our
contribution is threefold: (i) Our model significantly surpasses baselines and makes DP algorithm
achieve satisfactory performance on text generation; (ii) We propose several practical strategies to
enable SeqPATE to handle text generation with a sequential of classifications over larger output
spaces; (iii) We are the first to adapt PATE, an effective DP algorithm, to text generation."

PROBLEM SETUP"
PROBLEM SETUP,0.032679738562091505,"Our goal is to achieve the privacy protection defined by DP in text generation: preventing attackers
from inferring whether a sample or an n-gram appears in the training set. (Formal definition in Sec. 5)"
PROBLEM SETUP,0.03594771241830065,"PATE assumes students are trained on unlabeled non-sensitive data. Similar to PATE, our setting
contains two textual datasets: 1. a private set Dpri from a corpus with sensitive information. 2. a public
set Dpub without sensitive information (e.g. incomplete or masked text spans) or data contributors
(e.g. volunteers) have no objection to publishing their data. Algorithms are required to protect the
privacy on the private set and can ignore the privacy protection on the public set. The final goal is to
do well on the private set during inference."
PROBLEM SETUP,0.0392156862745098,"Text generation is to generate a sequence of words S = {w1, w2, . . . , wl}. Our application is a
simple text generation task, sentence completion, which aims to generate the remaining part of a
sentence w1:l given its prefix p1:l′, where p1:l′ and w1:l are the abbreviation of {p1, p2, . . . , pl′} and
{w1, w2, . . . , wl} respectively. p1:l′ and w1:l compose a complete sentence. We collect some input
prefixes p1:l′ to compose the public set Dpub and the original samples (complete sentences) compose
the private set Dpri. Such a setting fits for some real-world text generation applications: in dialog
systems, the training samples from online services consist of questions and responses. The questions
from customer service staffs or service robots can be public and the response from users carrying
individual information should be private. In writing assistants where a sample has an input prompt
and an essay body, the prompt can be public but the body written by data contributors is private."

• A student model fθ is trained on the public set Dpub and distills knowledge from private set (via the

set is preserved even if the student’s architecture and parameters are public or reverse-engineered
by an adversary. We publish only the student model for prediction."

APPROACH"
APPROACH,0.17973856209150327,"Fig. 1 shows an overview of the SeqPATE. Given the public prefix (e.g., “Cats sit”), we first obtain
pseudo inputs by generating the remaining part of the whole sentence (e.g., “Cats sit on the mats”)
using a pre-trained language model (Sec. 4.1). The teachers’ output distributions are then averaged
to provide word-level supervision on the whole sentence (Sec. 4.2). To reduce the noise over large
output space and limit the privacy loss, we propose top-k / top-p selection to dynamically filter the
unimportant candidates and propose efficient knowledge distillation to reduce the number of teacher
queries (Sec. 4.3). Our training algorithm is shown in Appendix A."

STUDENT MODEL"
STUDENT MODEL,0.18627450980392157,"Conventional text generation models generate words in a sentence step-by-step and left-to-right.
Naively applying PATE to the above paradigm requires all the teachers to be roll out to obtain
supervision at every step, where all the teachers aggregate to generate a word at each step and the
word acts as the next input for all teachers. This means we should conduct all teachers’ inferences
simultaneously and interdependently, which is costly in both computation (involving hundreds of
teachers) and privacy costs."
STUDENT MODEL,0.1895424836601307,"Hence, in SeqPATE, we employ GPT to generate pseudo sentences and conduct teacher inference
and student training on the pseudo sentences. Firstly, given a prefix in Dpub, we employ the public
released pre-trained GPT to conduct the inference to complete a pseudo sentence. All the generated
pseudo sentences compose the student’s training set, denoted as ˜Dpub. Secondly, we conduct teacher
inference and student training on the sample S = {w1, w2, . . . , w|S|} from ˜Dpub. At the i-th step,
for the training of conventional text generations, the student learns to generate a word ˆwi given its
previous words w1:i−1. At the i-th step, our teachers conduct the inference to generate ˆwi given the
input w1:i−1 from the sample S. Then, each teacher provides its output for aggregation. All teachers
share the same input with the student so that the outputs of teachers and student are aligned and
comparable."

TEACHER AGGREGATION,0.19934640522875818,"The original PATE aggregates teacher results by taking the majority vote of the predicted labels from

generation. This is because the number of votes for each candidate may be very low and it would
result in low agreement. For example, multiple candidates may tie for the top-1 prediction."
TEACHER AGGREGATION,0.20261437908496732,"Therefore, inspired by (Hinton et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2020), we aggregate M teachers’ results by

reduce the output dimension (hence the amount of noise), we only assign the probability mass to a
subset of candidates Wi. For all teachers and the student, we assign zero probability mass to any
candidates not in Wi and re-normalize distribution as shown in Eq. 1, where g(·) is the normalizing

Further, inspired by nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019), we propose a top-p selection that
chooses the minimum k where the cumulative probability of the top-k words is larger than a constant
close to 1 (e.g. 0.95) such that the candidate set covers a large proportion of the distribution. We note
that the candidate selection is based on the student’s output on public or already released input, thus
not affecting the privacy guarantee. This choice improves the privacy-utility tradeoff by adaptively
allocating the available privacy budgets to release the information more relevant to the task."

student’s predicted distribution, (i.e. the number of tokens with higher or equal probability). The
student model acquires the teachers’ supervision only if rwi is larger than a certain threshold rc. We

ABLATION STUDIES AND FURTHER ANALYSES,0.4444444444444444,"In the ablation studies (Table 2), SeqPATE mainly outperforms its variants shown in rows 2 to 7
verifying the effectiveness of our strategies, where −X represents SeqPAET’s variant without the
strategy X. −Merge P is the variant aggregating the teachers by voting instead of merging the
probabilities. Its poor performance shows that voting is not suitable for text generation with a large
output space where the voting leads to low agreement rates. −KL means the student learns from the
aggregation of teachers’ top-1 predictions via NLL loss instead of KL loss. The sharp performance
drop on −KL indicates the importance of KL loss. The performance of −NLL slightly decreases,
indicating that NLL loss makes a little contribution to SeqPATE. The reason is that we have pre-trained
on the student’s training set via NLL before student training. The promotion caused by efficient
knowledge distillation (Effi KD) on AirDialog is larger than that on Europarl v6, which shows the
“clever” student (e.g. models on AirDialog with low PPL and high Bleu) benefits more from this
strategy since it can sharply save the privacy cost and spend the cost where the student strongly
needs. −Gaussian means we use Laplace mechanism as mentioned in PATE instead of Gaussian
mechanism, which shows that the Gaussian mechanism works better. −All indicates discarding all
above strategies, which is similar to but not equivalent to the original PATE (the difference is that
PATE needs to roll out all teachers (Sec. 4.1), which disables PATE from working on text generation).
The poor performance of −All verifies that the original PATE is not adaptive to text generation."
ABLATION STUDIES AND FURTHER ANALYSES,0.4477124183006536,"Table 3 shows the performance of the top-p and top-k selection strategies (Sec. 4.3). As shown in row
1, our full model employs the top-p selection (the threshold µ = 0.95) surpasses most variants with
manually chosen k (rows 2 to 6). A selection with a too small k (k = 1 & k = 10) implies discarding
too much useful information from the supervision (k = 1 is different to −KL in Table 2, which
uses Top-1 of teachers’ results). A selection with oversize k results in involving more useless noise:
the candidates with very small probabilities should be rarely sampled during generation but random
noise may increase their probabilities, so models may generate words that are misled by the noise.
Supervisions on top-k candidates with k = 50 and k = 100 yields relatively good performance."

private data with injected noise to a student model. KNN-PATE (Zhu et al., 2020) refines PATE by
accessing only the k-nearest neighbors from the private set instead of the whole private set. The
above approaches are not customized for text generation models."
RELATED WORK,0.47058823529411764,"One direction of privacy protection in text generation is to protect author-level (user-level) information.
The methods prevent attackers from inferring the author attributes (e.g. gender, age) (Li et al., 2018)

(2017) and Song & Shmatikov (2019) infer the membership (whether a given user’s data is used to
train the model) given a black-box model. Another direction is to prevent attackers from extracting
sensitive information in the training set by analyzing the generated outputs (Nakamura et al., 2020;
Kerrigan et al., 2020), which is an urgent need since Carlini et al. (2020) achieve the extraction.
Our application focuses on this direction. In this direction, some researchers use regularization,
including dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) and quantization (Hubara et al., 2017), to restrict the model
capacity to avoid models memorizing too much original text from the privacy training set (Carlini
et al., 2019). Anonymization methods (Maeda et al., 2016; Suzuki et al., 2017) detects sensitive text
spans in training sets and replace the spans with non-sensitive texts. The above methods are non-DP
algorithms, which make sense intuitively but do not provide quantifiable and provable guarantees for
privacy protection."

against the identification of the users. Kerrigan et al. (2020) adapt DP-SGD to text generation, which
prevents the (not the user-level) sensitive training data from being extracted from text generation
models. Some of our concurrent works also follow this direction. Li et al. (2021) apply DP-SGD to
large pre-trained language models and reduce the memory usage of those models. Yu et al. (2021)

CONCLUSION,0.4803921568627451,"In this paper, we propose, SeqPATE, a framework to protect the privacy of the training data for
text generation model with DP guarantees. SeqPATE achieves a good privacy-utility tradeoff by
leveraging both private and public data. As an extension of PATE, SeqPATE can handle the sequential
generation paradigm with large output space at each step and thus is adaptive for text generation
models. We avoid rolling out the teachers by providing pseudo inputs for teacher inference and
student training and aggregate teachers by merging probabilities instead of voting. We further reduce
the output space by top-k or top-p selection and limit the privacy loss via an efficient knowledge
distillation. SeqPATE improves the baselines a lot and makes the private data useful to text generation
with a meaningful strength of privacy protection. In the future, we will apply SeqPATE to some
real-world applications, e.g. dialog systems and writing assistants."

can fully protect their privacy regardless of the strength of privacy protection (in terms of the value of
ε). Hence, we kindly remind the researchers, who will use this model, to pay more attention to the
strength of privacy protection. Further, we should prevent some researchers to collect the data from

Adam optimization scheme (Kingma & Ba, 2015) and we adjust the initial learning rate for all the
comparing methods with a range of 0.01 ∼0.00001, which means we conducted a systematic search
of the hyper-parameter space among all methods. We set the batch size as 32 for all the comparing

DETAILS ABOUT THE EVALUATION METRICS"
REFERENCES,0.8496732026143791,"To measure the quality of generation, PPL is a widely used metrics in text generation, especially
language modeling, which measures the perplexity of generating the next token. B-n (Bleu-n)
(Papineni et al., 2002) measures the degree of the n-gram matching between the generated results and
the ground-truth text."
REFERENCES,0.8529411764705882,"To measure the performance of privacy protection (we can also treat it as the privacy leak of the
models), we aim to give an intuitive understanding of the protection on text generation scenario (even
if the factor ε in DP indicates the strength of privacy protection according to the DP theorem). Hence,
we propose a new metric, P-N, indicating how many generated n-grams can be found in the private
set Dpri. We define NY as the set of unique n-grams in a generated sentence Y and define NDpri as
the set of unique n-grams in the private data Dpri. As shown in Eq. 4, P-N is the ratio of the n-grams
that occurs in the two sets over n-grams occurs only in NY weighted by idf, where the idf is the
inverse frequency of this n-gram indicating the sensitivity of this n-gram (Rare n-grams are likely to
carry sensitive information, such as SSN number and address). P-N ranges from 0 to 1 and lower P-N
indicates the more strong privacy protection (less privacy leak from the models)."
REFERENCES,0.8562091503267973,"For the choice of value N, we note that P-N with a very small value of N can hardly reflect the privacy
loss since the uni-grams and bi-grams are very easy to be generated even if the model did not meet it
from the private dataset Dpri. For example, the N=1 does not make sense because it only reflects the
vocabulary overlapping between two datasets. Thus, we choose 3 and 4 as the value of N."

Since our method uses a large number of teachers, the
naive implementation of loading all teachers into memory for aggregation is impractical. However,
note that our algorithm only needs to access each teacher’s top-k prediction. Therefore, we train
teacher models sequentially. Once a teacher model is trained, we obtain its top-k prediction (k=200
in our experiments) on the public training data and save the results (i.e. k probabilities). Then, we
discard the teacher model. Finally, SeqPATE only needs teacher supervision on a small number
of samples. In our experiments, training on 1∼2k teacher labeled samples is sufficient. Overall,
saving teachers’ inference results uses 8∼16G. The memory usage is similar to that of a GPT2 model
because we do not load all teacher models into memory and instead run inference sequentially and
merge teachers’ predictions offline."
REFERENCES,0.9084967320261438,"Training time.
While we have a large number of teachers, each teacher is trained on only a small
fraction of the entire dataset. Thus the time it takes to train all teachers is roughly equal to the time of
training a single GPT2 model on the full dataset (of 1∼2M samples in our experiments)."
REFERENCES,0.9117647058823529,"In summary, with simple tricks, the teacher training and aggregation steps are not much more
expensive than training a GPT2 model. Compared to standard NLG model training, our algorithm
does not require special hardware or distributed learning."

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON LARGER ε AND LARGER δ"

utility gap between SeqPATE and the non-private training method (Pri-GPT) on the AirDialog dataset.
Actually, our model performance can be increased a lot if we conduct weaker privacy protection (i.e.
using a larger ε and a larger δ). In Table 6, we show the experimental results with ε=3 and δ=1e-6 on

HANDLE LARGE ε: USING FEWER TEACHERS"
REFERENCES,0.934640522875817,"As shown in Fig. 2, when we use large ε, our SeqPATE cannot obtain better performance than
DP-SGD. As discussed in Sec. 6.2, the reason is that the amount of training samples for each teacher
model is quite small in our model (especially, when the teacher number is large). We note that this
can be improved by using fewer teachers. As shown in Table 7, we conduct experiments on AirDialog
dataset with fewer (i.e. 100) teachers and larger ε (i.e. 50 and 500), where SeqPATE outperforms
DP-SGD. For DP-SGD, we choose Pub-GPT+ DP-SGD instead of Pub-GPT+DP-SGD+ ˜Dpub since
Pub-GPT+ DP-SGD obtains higher performance when ε is large."

EVALUATING PRIVACY LEAK IN ANOTHER METRIC (EXPOSURE)"
REFERENCES,0.9477124183006536,"We have evaluated the performance of privacy protection in P-3 and P-4. We also conduct experiments
on another metric, exposure, to evaluate the privacy leak. The exposure is proposed by (Carlini et al.,
2019). To calculate the score, we use three kinds of patterns “is <word> | are <word> | <digital>”.
The repetitions r are 100 for all patterns, and the lengths of sampled words or digits are three. The
candidate words are randomly sampled from the whole vocabulary and the digits are randomly
sampled from {0, 1, ..., 9}. We calculate the average exposure score over the three kinds of patterns.
We follow the implementation of the exposure score from 8."

THE ILLUSTRATION OF A RUNNING EXAMPLE."
REFERENCES,0.9967320261437909,"Here, we will use an example to show our training processing. In this example, the prefix from the
public dataset Dpub is “I want to book”. We feed the prefix to pre-trained GPT2 to generate a pseudo
sentence “I want to book a flight from Tokyo to Hawaii.”. The pseudo sentence will serve as an
example in the pseudo public dataset ˜Dpub. We feed the pseudo sentence to the teacher models to
conduct the teacher inference and also feed it to the student model to conduct the feed-forward of the
student training. Teacher models output the probability distributions on all words (10 words, in total)
of the sentence. Then, we aggregate all teachers’ probability distributions and add the calibrated
noise on the aggregated distributions. The student model also generates the corresponding probability
distributions on those words and we conduct the efficient knowledge distillation and top-k or top-p
selection over the student’s probability distributions. For example, if the student model can do well
on the words (“I”, “want”, “book”, “flight”, and “Tokyo”), the student will only query the teachers’
output distributions on the rest of words (“to”, “from”, “to”, and “Hawaii”) through the KL loss
mentioned in 2. Besides, the student is always supervised by the NLL loss on the whole pseudo
sentence (“I want to book a flight from Tokyo to Hawaii.”). Finally, the student model conducts
back-propagation according to the above losses."
