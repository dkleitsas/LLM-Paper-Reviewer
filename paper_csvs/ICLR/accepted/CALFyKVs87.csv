ABSTRACT,0.0027548209366391185,"The ability to learn reward functions plays an important role in enabling the de-
ployment of intelligent agents in the real world. However, comparing reward func-
tions, for example as a means of evaluating reward learning methods, presents a
challenge. Reward functions are typically compared by considering the behavior
of optimized policies, but this approach conﬂates deﬁciencies in the reward func-
tion with those of the policy search algorithm used to optimize it. To address this
challenge, Gleave et al. (2020) propose the Equivalent-Policy Invariant Compar-
ison (EPIC) distance. EPIC avoids policy optimization, but in doing so requires
computing reward values at transitions that may be impossible under the system
dynamics. This is problematic for learned reward functions because it entails eval-
uating them outside of their training distribution, resulting in inaccurate reward
values that we show can render EPIC ineffective at comparing rewards. To ad-
dress this problem, we propose the Dynamics-Aware Reward Distance (DARD),
a new reward pseudometric. DARD uses an approximate transition model of the
environment to transform reward functions into a form that allows for compar-
isons that are invariant to reward shaping while only evaluating reward functions
on transitions close to their training distribution. Experiments in simulated physi-
cal domains demonstrate that DARD enables reliable reward comparisons without
policy optimization and is signiﬁcantly more predictive than baseline methods of
downstream policy performance when dealing with learned reward functions.†"

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.008264462809917356,"Reward functions provide a general way to specify objectives for reinforcement learning. Tasks
such as game playing have simple, natural reward functions that enable learning of effective poli-
cies (Tesauro, 1995; Mnih et al., 2013; Silver et al., 2017); however, many tasks, such as those
involving human interaction, multiple competing objectives, or high-dimensional state spaces, do
not have easy to deﬁne reward functions (Knox et al., 2021; Holland et al., 2013; Cabi et al., 2019).
In these cases, reward functions can be learned from demonstrations, explicit preferences, or other
forms of reward supervision (Ziebart et al., 2008; Christiano et al., 2017; Cabi et al., 2019). How-
ever, evaluating the quality of learned reward functions, which may be too complicated to manually
inspect, remains an open challenge."
INTRODUCTION,0.011019283746556474,"Prior work on comparing reward functions typically involves a computationally expensive and indi-
rect process of (i) learning a reward function, (ii) learning a policy on that reward function, and (iii)
evaluating that policy on a known, ground-truth reward function. Gleave et al. (2020) refer to this as
the “rollout method” for evaluating methods for learning reward functions. Furthermore, the rollout
method can be potentially dangerous in safety critical environments because (i) it cannot distinguish
deﬁciencies between the reward function and the policy optimization procedure, and (ii) rewards are"

all the transitions required to accurately quantify reward differences."
INTRODUCTION,0.02203856749311295,"To address these challenges, Gleave et al. (2020) introduce Equivalent-Policy Invariant Comparison
(EPIC). EPIC quantiﬁes differences in reward functions directly, without learning policies. EPIC
uses an ofﬂine dataset of transitions, and consists of two stages. First, transitions from this dataset
are used to convert reward functions to a canonical form that is invariant to reward transformations
that do not affect the optimal policy. Second, the correlation between reward values is computed on
transition samples, yielding a pseudometric capturing reward function similarity. However, when
computing this canonical form, EPIC evaluates rewards on transitions between all state-state com-
binations, regardless of whether those state-state transitions are possible or not. While this makes
it possible for EPIC to quantify reward distances that are robust to arbitrary changes in transition
dynamics, in practice evaluating learned reward functions on physically impossible transitions leads
to unreliable reward values, as these are outside the distribution of the transitions on which the re-
ward functions are learned. We show empirically in Section 5 that these out-of-distribution reward
evaluations can render EPIC an ineffective reward comparison metric."
INTRODUCTION,0.024793388429752067,"To address this issue, we propose a new method for quantifying differences in reward functions,
Dynamics-Aware Reward Distance (DARD), that transforms reward functions into a form allow-
ing for reward-shaping-invariant comparisons while ensuring that learned reward functions are only
evaluated on transitions that are approximately physically realizable. We achieve this by assuming
access to a transition model for the environment of interest, and evaluate reward functions on tran-
sitions sampled from this transition model. As a result, DARD only evaluates learned reward func-
tions close to their training distribution, and is well motivated in a variety of physical environments
in which transition models are unlikely to change signiﬁcantly between learning and deployment.
Experiments suggest that DARD better reﬂects reward function similarity than does EPIC in com-
paring learned reward functions in two simulated, physics-based environments: the ﬁrst involving
multi-agent navigation, and the second involving manipulating a robotic arm."

LEARNING REWARD FUNCTIONS"
LEARNING REWARD FUNCTIONS,0.03305785123966942,"A variety of methods exist for learning reward functions, which can be categorized based on the
form of supervision used. Rewards can be learned from supervision provided by explicit labels.
For example, human-labeled preferences between demonstrations can be used to learn reward func-
tions (Christiano et al., 2017). Rewards can also be labeled on a per-timestep basis, allowing for
learning via supervised regression (Cabi et al., 2019)."
LEARNING REWARD FUNCTIONS,0.03581267217630854,"Alternatively, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods typically assume access to expert
demonstrations, and attempt to ﬁnd a reward function under which the expert is uniquely opti-
mal (Ziebart et al., 2008). IRL is underconstrained in that many reward functions can make the
expert policy appear optimal. This problem is often addressed by favoring reward functions that
induce high-entropy optimal policies (Ziebart et al., 2008). Recent work in IRL focuses on learning
reward functions with expressive function approximators such as neural networks, particularly in an
adversarial formulation (Fu et al., 2017). There has also been recent interest in ofﬂine IRL meth-
ods (Lee et al., 2019). In this work, we study how these various reward learning methods can be
evaluated efﬁciently and accurately in practice."

to large variance. Direct OPE methods (Dudik et al. (2011)), apply regression-based techniques in
either a model-based (Paduraru, 2013) or model-free setting (Le et al., 2019). Contemporary works
combine these two methods using Doubly Robust Estimation, which originated in a contextual ban-
dits setting (Dudik et al., 2011), and was later extended to reinforcement learning by Jiang & Li
(2016). More recent works seek to forego models and importance sampling entirely, such as Irpan

as the decision function."
EVALUATING METHODS OF LEARNING REWARD FUNCTIONS,0.05234159779614325,"All OPE methods indirectly evaluate the reward by estimating the value of the induced optimal pol-
icy. This introduces additional complexity into the evaluation procedure and can obfuscate sources
of error as resulting either from aspects of policy learning or due to the underlying reward function.
EPIC (Gleave et al., 2020) seeks to circumvent these shortcomings by comparing reward functions
directly. Our work builds on EPIC as covered in Section 4, but uses a transition model of the envi-
ronment to signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of comparisons involving learned reward functions."

E[R(s, A, S′)], and E[R(S, A, S′)] with independent random variables S and S′ distributed as DS,
which in practice is the marginal distribution of states in the dataset. Thus, the resulting transitions
may not actually be possible under the transition model of the environment of interest. Comput-
ing transformed rewards with these out-of-distribution transitions allows EPIC to be robust to (arbi-

out-of-distribution transitions, could justiﬁably be regarded as different."

robot interacts with its environment. Because EPIC necessarily evaluates learned reward functions

perfectly in-distribution with respect to T. This is because S′′ is distributed conditionally on the
original s′ as opposed to the random variable S′. These transitions are nevertheless much closer to
physically realizable than those sampled in EPIC. In Section 5 we show that learned reward functions
are relatively insensitive to these slight errors in practice. We select DA to densely cover the space
of possible actions. We do this because during policy optimization, policies may select a wide range
of possible actions, resulting in evaluating learned reward functions on this same distribution of
actions. See Figure 1 for a visualization of our dynamics-aware transformation. Informally, this
operation normalizes the reward values of a transition (s, a, s′) based on the reward values of nearby
transitions sampled from the transition model. This normalization allows for a comparison between
reward functions that is invariant to potential shaping.

Though, unlike EPIC, DARD assumes knowledge of transition dynamics and that these dynamics
will remain similar during deployment, DARD uses these additional assumptions to produce signif-
icantly more accurate and predictive distances between learned reward functions in practice."

EXPERIMENTS"
EXPERIMENTS,0.2231404958677686,"In experiments we evaluate the following hypotheses: H1: EPIC is a poor predictor of policy return
for learned reward functions due to its out-of-distribution evaluation of these reward functions. H2:
DARD is predictive of policy return even for learned reward models, while maintaining EPIC’s in-
variance to reward shaping. H3: DARD is predictive of policy performance across diverse coverage
distributions. H4: DARD is predictive of policy return when using learned, high-ﬁdelity transition
models. We test these hypotheses by computing each metric across a set of reward models, and
then evaluate a policy trained on each reward model against a ground truth reward function through
on-policy evaluation. We perform these steps across two environments as described next."

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP"
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.22865013774104684,"Environments
We evaluate DARD in two environments. We ﬁrst study the Bouncing Balls en-
vironment, which requires an agent to navigate from a random initial position to a random goal
position while avoiding a set of balls randomly bouncing around the scene. This environment cap-
tures elements of real-world, physical environments with multiple interacting agents, as is the case,
for example, in autonomous driving. In these types of environments, EPIC samples transitions in a"

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.23415977961432508,"manner such that agents teleport around the scene, causing issues for learned reward models. The
second environment is adapted from the Reacher environment from OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al.,
2016). This environment captures aspects of robotic manipulation tasks where arbitrary changes in
joint conﬁguration between s and s′ can cause issues for learned reward models. Videos illustrating
both environments can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/dard-paper."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.2369146005509642,"Coverage Distributions
In order to compute reward distances for DARD, we must sample transi-
tions from the environments. In the experiments we consider two coverage distributions. The ﬁrst is
the distribution induced by a policy that takes actions uniformly at random across magnitude bounds
(denoted by πuni). The second is the distribution over transitions of an expert policy π∗, which we
learn in both environments using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Schulman et al. (2017)."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.2396694214876033,"Action Sampling and Transition Models
Both environments have a 2D, continuous action space.
DARD samples actions from these spaces (i.e., deﬁnes DA) by deﬁning an uniformly-spaced, 2D
grid of action values within magnitude bounds."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.24242424242424243,"We consider two versions of DARD in the experiments. The ﬁrst uses (approximate) ground-truth
transition models, and the second uses learned transition models, which we refer to as DARD-L
in the results. For the ground-truth transition model in the Bouncing Balls environment we use
a constant velocity model that deterministically samples next states conditional on each sampled
action. For the Reacher environment, we use the underlying MuJoCo simulator (Todorov et al.,
2012) as the transition model, again deterministically sampling next states."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.24517906336088155,"We additionally learn neural network transition models for each environment. In the Bouncing
Balls environment, we learn a transition model that independently predicts position deltas for each
ball based on its physical state and the action (in the case of the controlled agent). In the Reacher
environment, we learn a transition model that takes as input the state and action, and predicts a state
delta used to produce the next state. See Appendix A.1.4 for model architecture and training details."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.24793388429752067,"Reward Models
For each environment, we deﬁne or learn the following reward models:"
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.25068870523415976,"GROUND TRUTH: The reward function against which we perform on-policy evaluation. In both
environments, this is a goal-based reward given when the agent position is within some range of the
goal location. The Reacher environment also contains additive terms penalizing distance from the
goal and large action magnitudes."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.2534435261707989,"SHAPED: The ground truth reward function, shaped by a potential function. In both environments,
we use a potential shaping based on the distance to the goal location. In the Bouncing Balls envi-
ronment, we take the difference in the square root of the distance to goal (due to the large distance
values). In the Reacher environment we use the difference of distances from the end effector to goal
directly."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.256198347107438,"FEASIBILITY: A manually-deﬁned reward model that returns the shaped reward function when
evaluated with a dynamically-feasible transition, and returns unit Gaussian noise otherwise. This
serves as a sanity check to illustrate that EPIC performs poorly on models that exhibit inaccurate
reward values on OOD transitions."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.25895316804407714,"REGRESS: A learned model trained via regression to the shaped reward model. We regress the
shaped reward function because otherwise the metrics do not need to account for shaping (see Ap-
pendix A.2.1 for an example). Although simple, this method is used in practice in cases where
people manually label reward functions (Cabi et al., 2019), and was used as a baseline in Christiano
et al. (2017) (“target” method, section 3.3)."

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,0.2809917355371901,"Table 1: Results for the Bouncing Balls (Top) and Reacher (Bottom) environments. Center: For
each reward model, we compute each distance metric×1000 from GROUND TRUTH (GT). The
coverage distribution is indicated by the policy (πuni corresponding to the distribution resulting from
uniformly random actions, π∗to that from expert actions). Right: The average episode return and its
standard error of the policy trained on the corresponding reward model. Values are averaged over 5
executions of all steps (data collection, reward learning, reward evaluation) across different random
seeds (see Appendix A.1.7 for standard errors of distances). Distance values that are inversely corre-
lated with episode return are desirable (i.e., increasing distance within a column should correspond
with decreasing episode return). Additionally, for hand-designed models that are equivalent to GT
(SHAPING, FEASIBILITY), and for well-ﬁt learned models (REGRESS), lower is better. Learned
models are ﬁt to SHAPED, and may produce higher episode return than those ﬁt to GT as a result."

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,0.29476584022038566,"Table 1 summarizes the experimental results, which provide support for H1 across both environ-
ments. We ﬁrst note as a sanity check that EPIC assigns large distances between GROUND TRUTH
and FEASIBILITY. This demonstrates EPIC’s tendency to assign large distances to reward functions
that are equivalent when assuming a ﬁxed transition model, but different under an arbitrary transi-
tion model. This behavior manifests with learned models in practice due to EPIC’s OOD evaluation
of those models. For example, in both environments EPIC assigns large distances to the REGRESS
model when, based on policy performance, we see that it is quite similar to the ground truth (disre-
garding shaping). This results from EPIC’s evaluation of these reward models with OOD transitions,
which is illustrated by the fact that the metric is more much predictive of on-policy performance on
the REGRESS OOD model (which does not suffer from OOD evaluation issues). Perhaps most
importantly, EPIC fails to be predictive of episode return when comparing learned models. For ex-
ample, in the Reacher environment, the metric assigns a lower distance to PREFERENCES (PREF)
than REGRESS despite the lower episode returns of PREF."
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,0.2975206611570248,"The results from both environments also support H2. In the Bouncing Balls environment, DARD
gives low distances for the well-ﬁt models (FEASIBILITY, REGRESS, REGRESS OOD) as a result
of only evaluating them in their training distribution. In the Reacher environment, DARD exhibits a
gap between REGRESS and REGRESS OOD, which indicates that the algorithm’s evaluation of the
reward model on slightly out-of-distribution transitions does hurt performance. Nevertheless, on the"

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,0.30303030303030304,"reward models that can be learned in practice (REGRESS, PREF) DARD produces distances that
are more predictive of episode return compared to baseline methods."
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,0.30578512396694213,"The results also demonstrate that DARD is predictive of episode return across coverage distributions
(H3). DARD is sensitive to the choice of coverage distribution because the transitions the metric
samples are tightly grouped around this distribution. This is reﬂected in the different distance scales
between πuni and π∗. Nevertheless, the relative value of DARD within a sampling distribution is still
predictive of episode return. For example, the metric maintains a consistent ordering of the models
across πuni and π∗in both environments."
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,0.3085399449035813,"Finally, the results largely support the hypothesis (H4) that replacing ground truth transition models
in DARD with high-ﬁdelity learned ones still results in distance values predictive of policy return.
This conclusion is supported by DARD-L’s predictiveness of policy return across both environments
and coverage distributions. In most cases, the distance values of DARD-L closely match those of
DARD. Three reasons for this close correspondence are: (i) high-ﬁdelity transition models can be
ﬁt in the relatively low-dimensional environments considered, (ii) DARD uses transition models to
make single-step predictions, which avoids the compounding errors that may occur when sampling
rollouts, and (iii) the environments and coverage distributions considered generally produce reward
functions insensitive to small errors in the predicted states. The lower distance values of DARD-L in
the Reacher environment when using the expert coverage distribution are an exception to this trend.
By analyzing the errors made by the learned transition model, we concluded that the lower distances
of DARD-L result from the reward functions being quite sensitive to small errors in predicted states
in this case (see Appendix A.3.2 for detailed analysis). Although the distance values are still pre-
dictive of policy return, this result is an instance of the false positive equivalence that can result
from errors in the transition model (as discussed in Appendix A.3.1 (case 2.B)), and illustrates the
importance of applying DARD with well-ﬁt learned transitions models."
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,0.31129476584022037,"Limitations
In our experiments, we discovered that DARD is poorly suited for reward comparison
in environments where nearby transitions exclusively have similar reward values. This is the case,
for example, in robotic domains with small timesteps and in which a smooth reward function is
used (such as negative distance to the goal). We illustrate this behavior and explain why it occurs
in Appendix A.2.1 with experiments on the Point Maze environment used by Gleave et al. (2020).
In short, because DARD performs reward comparisons between transitions relative to a transition
model, if all the transitions it considers (across all possible actions) have nearly-identical reward
values, it can be sensitive to noise in the reward model. For this reason, DARD should be used in
environments for which, at least for some parts of the state-action space, nearby transitions yield
well-differentiated reward values."
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,0.3140495867768595,"Overall, these experiments demonstrate that in situations where we have conﬁdence the transition
model will not change signiﬁcantly, as is the case in many physical settings, DARD allows for
comparing learned reward functions with other reward functions without policy optimization."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.31955922865013775,"The ability to reliably compare reward functions is a critical tool for ensuring that intelligent sys-
tems have objectives that are aligned with human intentions. The typical approach to comparing
reward functions, which involves learning policies on them, conﬂates errors in the reward with er-
rors in policy optimization. We present Dynamics-Aware Reward Distance (DARD), a pseudomet-
ric that allows for comparing rewards directly while being invariant to reward shaping. DARD uses
knowledge of the transition dynamics to avoid evaluating learned reward functions far outside their
training distribution. Experiments suggest that for environments where we can assume the transition
dynamics will not change signiﬁcantly between evaluation and deployment time that DARD reliably
predicts policy performance associated with a reward function, even learned ones, without learning
policies and without requiring online environment interaction."
CONCLUSION,0.32231404958677684,"There are a number of exciting areas for future work. For example, DARD could be used to deﬁne
benchmarks for evaluating reward learning methods (e.g., in applications such as autonomous driv-
ing or robotics; see Appendix A.3.3). Second, DARD could be applied to high-dimensional (e.g.,
visual) domains where learned transition models are necessary and for which OOD evaluation issues
are likely particularly challenging to overcome."

ENVIRONMENTS"
REFERENCES,0.44077134986225897,"Bouncing Balls Environment
This is a custom environment with traits of multi-agent navigation
environments such as autonomous driving. The agent attempts to navigate to a random goal location
while avoiding a set of balls (other agents) bouncing around the scene. The state consists of the
position and velocity of the balls (the agent included), as well as the goal location. The action space
is a 2D continuous space of accelerations between [−5, 5] to apply to the agent state. The transition
function applies the agent accelerations to its state, while the other agents apply random accelera-
tions sampled from a zero-mean, low variance Gaussian distribution. The reward function gives a
positive value once the agent is within some distance of the goal, which results in the agent and goal
position being randomly moved. This environment executes for a ﬁxed horizon of 400 timesteps to
approximate a continuing, inﬁnite horizon MDP. We make the environment approximately contin-
uing in order to ensure that S and S′ are distributed identically as is required by EPIC. Sampling
S and S′ from their marginal distributions in the dataset results in transitions where the agents in
s have completely different positions and velocities as in s′, an issue that would be encountered in
real-world multi-agent settings."
REFERENCES,0.44352617079889806,"Reacher Environment
This environment is adapted from the Reacher environment from OpenAI
gym (Brockman et al., 2016). We adapt the environment in two ways. First, we add a goal-based
reward component. Second, we increase the timesteps between states to 5 from an original 2. We
make both these changes so that the rewards of nearby transitions are sufﬁciently differentiated (see
A.2.1 for detailed motivation)."

absolute velocity of each ball is then passed to a fully-connected network, which outputs a position
delta to be applied to the original state. In the case of the controlled ball, the action is also provided

POINT MAZE EXPERIMENTS"
REFERENCES,0.6253443526170799,"In this section we present results for the Point Maze environment considered in Gleave et al. (2020).
These results illustrate a disadvantage of DARD. As discussed in section 5, because DARD performs
reward comparisons between transitions relative to a transition model, if all the transitions it consid-
ers (across all possible actions) have near-identical reward values, it can be sensitive to noise in the
reward model. The Point Maze environment ﬁts this description, and DARD performs poorly on it as
a result (see table 10). We provide evidence for the hypothesis that the lack of reward-differentiated
transitions causes this poor performance by also providing results for an adapted Point Maze en-
vironment, which is identical to the original except that we increase the time difference between
timesteps by a factor of 5 (such that nearby transitions yield different reward values). In this adapted
case, DARD and EPIC distances are signiﬁcantly closer than in the original environment."
REFERENCES,0.628099173553719,"Two additional traits of the environment are relevant. First, the ground truth reward is only a function
of the current state and action, but not the next state. As a result, learned reward models tend
to ignore the next state, which minimizes the effect of the OOD reward evaluations performed by
EPIC. Second, in these experiments (unlike those in section 5) we train reward models to ﬁt the
ground truth reward model (as opposed to a shaped version of it). We do this to be consistent with
the experiments provided in Gleave et al. (2020); however, this results in the learned reward models
exhibiting little shaping (as illustrated by the low distance values of Dp). This is a property of the
reward learning algorithm and speciﬁc environment in which it is applied, but learned reward models
may exhibit signiﬁcant shaping in general (Fu et al., 2017)."

METRIC SAMPLE SIZE SENSITIVITY"

The answer depends on the speciﬁc environment, reward functions, and comparison metric under

conﬁdence interval (CI) of the mean reward distance across different sample sizes. In this context, a
smaller CI width indicates that a metric is less sensitive to the random variations in the sampling of

For each dataset, we compute each metric comparing each reward function to the ground-truth re-

the evaluation datasets, we use π∗for the Bouncing Balls environment, and πuni for the Reacher
environment. We use π∗for Bouncing Balls because the reward is sufﬁciently sparse that for small
sample sizes, N, the metric values are frequently undeﬁned (due to only having samples with zero
reward). Using π∗instead of πuni increases the fraction of transitions within the goal threshold
addressing the problem."
REFERENCES,0.6446280991735537,"Reward Functions
We compare a set of manually deﬁned and learned reward functions. For the
manually deﬁned reward functions, we desire a set of rewards that smoothly vary in similarity to the
ground-truth reward. To accomplish this, we use a noisy version of the ground-truth reward deﬁned
as Rnoisy(s, a, s′) = R(s, a, s′) + ϵ for ϵ ∼N(0, σ). By increasing σ we produce a sequence
of reward functions that are increasingly different from the ground-truth reward. For the learned
rewards, we use the REGRESS and REGRESS OOD reward models introduced in Section 5. Recall
that REGRESS is trained on transitions sampled from a dataset of demonstrations collected from
the environment, whereas REGRESS OOD is trained on the distribution of transitions resulting
from sampling actions and next states independently from the starting state. The resulting training
distribution matches that used by EPIC in comparing rewards."
REFERENCES,0.6473829201101928,"Results
Fig. 2 shows the results of the experiment, with each row corresponding to a different
reward function, and each column corresponding to a different environment (Bouncing Balls on the
left and Reacher on the right). We see that the 95% CI width for DARD and EPIC are quite similar
for the noisy ground-truth reward functions (top three rows of the ﬁgure) across all sample sizes.
This indicates that, for these types of reward functions, the two metrics are similarly sensitive to the
size of the dataset. Note that as the amount of noise increases so does the width of the CI, but the
similarity of results across metrics holds."
REFERENCES,0.650137741046832,"For the learned reward models we do observe different behavior between the metrics. In the case
of the REGRESS model (4th row from the top), we see that DARD yields signiﬁcantly smaller CI
widths than does EPIC. The reason for this is that EPIC evaluates the reward function at transitions
outside its training distribution, which can yield arbitrary values. The additional randomness (with
respect to the random sampling of the data subset) incurred in these reward calculations results in
more variation in the reward distance, which produces larger CIs. In contrast, DARD avoids these
OOD evaluations of the reward, instead staying close to the reward function training distribution
where it is more consistent (across data subsets), producing smaller CIs."
REFERENCES,0.6528925619834711,"For the REGRESS OOD reward model (bottom row), we observe the inverse: EPIC produces
smaller CI widths than does DARD. This is because the reward model training distribution matches
the one used by EPIC. As a result, the “imagined” transitions of EPIC effectively increase the size of
the evaluation dataset producing less variation for a given sample size. DARD also uses “imagined”
transitions, but only from the distribution of transitions encountered in practice in the environment."

We evaluated the sensitivity of DARD and EPIC to variations in sample size across
different environments and reward models. We found that for noisy ground-truth reward functions,
the two metrics performed similarly, and that for learned reward functions, the relative sensitivity of
the metrics depends on the training distribution of the reward function under consideration."

reason we disallow negative weights for these components is that they make policy optimization
challenging or ill-posed: in the distance from goal case it creates a challenging exploration
problem, and in the action magnitude case it encourages the policy to output increasingly
large actions. Weights for the goal-reached indicator component are sampled uniformly
from [−1, 1]. The reward function is then computed as a linear combination of the reward compo-
nents weighted by these sampled values. We sample 128 reward functions in total. Policy optimiza-
tion, reward evaluation, and policy evaluation are performed as described in Appendix A.1."
REGRESSION,0.8071625344352618,"Results
Fig. 3 visualizes the results from the experiment, computing DARD on the random (πuni)
and expert (π∗) coverage distributions. We see that in both cases DARD is predictive of policy
return as indicated by the association between small DARD distances and large policy return. The
DARD distance and policy return are both heavily dependent on the sign of the goal-reached
indicator weight, which we visualize by coloring points based on the sign of this weight. When
the sign is negative, the policy learns to avoid getting too close to the goal, thereby dramatically re-
ducing its expected return under the ground-truth reward. The πuni plot shows policy return decaying
more quickly as a function of DARD distance than does the plot of π∗. The reason for this is that in
the πuni case, the action magnitude contributes much more signiﬁcantly to the DARD distance than
in the π∗case (because π∗generally consists of small actions near the goal state)."
REGRESSION,0.8099173553719008,"There are some outliers in the plot, which seem to result from extreme combinations of weight val-
ues that can cause policy optimization issues. For example, cases of low DARD distance and low
policy return in general tend to have small distance from goal weights and large, positive
goal-reached indicator weights. In these cases, the reward is quite sparse, causing prob-
lems for policy optimization (based on prior experiments, the policy does eventually achieve high
expected return, but only with more training timesteps). In the πuni case, instances of large DARD
distance and high policy return tend to result from extremely small action magnitude weights
and large, positive goal-reached indicator weights. In these cases, the optimized policy
takes large magnitude actions to quickly reach the goal state. This incurs a large penalty over the
ﬁrst few timesteps of the episode, after which the agent remains mostly stationary, accruing the
goal-reached reward. This trend does not hold for π∗, which demonstrates DARD’s sensitivity to
the coverage distribution."
REGRESSION,0.8126721763085399,"Conclusion
In this section, we evaluated DARD on a large number of random reward functions in
the Reacher environment, many of which differ signiﬁcantly from the ground-truth reward. Results
demonstrate that DARD maintains its predictiveness of policy return in this setting across both

THE IMPACT OF TRANSITION MODEL ERRORS ON DARD"
REGRESSION,0.8209366391184573,"In this section, we discuss how errors made by the transition model can impact the performance
of DARD. We organize our discussion of this topic around different cases of reward equivalence
and different types of errors that a transition model might make. The high-level summary of the
following discussion is that errors in the transition model only impact the performance of DARD
on reward functions that are not equivalent everywhere (case 2 below), and in this case DARD may
produce both false negative and false positive equivalences as a result of transition model errors."
REGRESSION,0.8236914600550964,"Case 1: Equivalent Reward Functions
Consider two reward functions that are equivalent across
the full space of transitions accounting for reward shaping (this includes the case of identical re-
wards). The proof of Proposition 2 does not rely on any proprieties of the transition model. As
a result, we can conclude that even arbitrary errors in the transition model will not result in two
everywhere-equivalent reward functions being considered different. This logic indicates that errors
in the transition model may only impact the performance of DARD when the reward functions are
not everywhere-equivalent as discussed next."

Given the ground
truth transition model, DARD would correctly identify the two rewards as equivalent (with respect
to realizable transitions). However, if the transition model erroneously samples unrealizable transi-
tions on which the rewards differ, the transformation term of Eq. (3) could assume arbitrary values,
thereby resulting in the two rewards being considered different. This might occur, for example,
when dealing with learned reward functions for which sampled next states are OOD with respect to

REGRESSION,0.8622589531680441,"For example, suppose a transition model is learned for an autonomous driving environment. Because
collisions are rare in this environment, the transition model might never sample transitions involving
collisions. As a result, two reward models that differ only with respect to transitions involving
collisions may be considered equivalent by DARD. In the preceding text, we say that DARD may
produce false positive equivalences in this case because even with an erroneous transition model, if
the dataset on which the rewards are compared itself contains transitions on which the rewards differ
DARD will still recognize them as different (due to the R(s, a, s′) term of Eq. (3)). Continuing
the autonomous driving example: if the dataset itself contains collisions, then the rewards will be
identiﬁed as different even if the transition models do not sample collisions. This case illustrates the
importance of using a comprehensive coverage distribution in comparing reward functions."

beyond the threshold at which the “goal reached” reward is assigned."
REGRESSION,0.8898071625344353,"the “goal reached” reward is given. This causes the reward functions to be sensitive to small errors

REGRESSION,0.8925619834710744,"On average, the learned transition model predicts larger next state end-effector displacements than
the ground truth transition model. This can be seen in Fig. 4 where we plot the histogram of ground
truth and predicted displacements over a set of transitions for which the transformed reward differs
the most between the ground truth and learned transition models. These erroneous, larger predicted
distances result from using a mean squared error loss, which causes displacements near zero to
contribute a minuscule amount to the loss."
REGRESSION,0.8953168044077136,"As a result, the next states predicted by the learned transition model are on average easier to assign
rewards to than those of the ground-truth transition model: they are more clearly beyond the limit
of the “goal reached” threshold, and (due to being farther away) reward shaping (which is easier
to predict) constitutes a larger fraction of the reward. Overall this results in the learned transition
model yielding lower DARD distances than those of the ground truth transition model. This is an
instance of Case 2.B in Appendix A.3.1: states at which the reward models differ more are sampled
relatively less frequently due to errors in the learned transition model."

APPLICATIONS OF REWARD COMPARISON METRICS"
REGRESSION,0.9008264462809917,This section discusses two potential applications of reward comparison metrics.
REGRESSION,0.9035812672176309,"Benchmarking Reward Learning Algorithms
Suppose we have a large amount of (potentially
suboptimal) demonstration data from which we would like to learn a reward function using one
of a variety of potential IRL algorithms. Additionally, suppose that we have (through an expen-"

assume that evaluating a policy online involves an expensive or dangerous process, and that learn-
ing a policy for this environment is itself challenging (e.g., sometimes fails or produces policies of
highly-variable quality). Note that this setting might occur in practice in physical robotic domains
such as autonomous driving or robotic manipulation."
REGRESSION,0.9118457300275482,"In summary, we would like to know which of the set of possible IRL algorithms produces the best
reward function using the large set of demonstrations, but we would prefer to avoid policy learning
and evaluation. One way to accomplish this goal would be to learn a “benchmark” reward model
on the small set of manually labeled rewards (e.g., through supervised learning as in Cabi et al.
(2019)), and then to compare that with the rewards produced by the various IRL algorithms. If a
reward function learned via IRL is similar to the benchmark reward function, this indicates that it
is similar to the reward function manually deﬁned by experts, and should therefore be preferred. In
this way, we can evaluate the different IRL methods we are considering, and choose the best for our
problem. Furthermore, this approach could be applied in creating an open benchmark enabling the
comparison of reward learning methods."
REGRESSION,0.9146005509641874,"Validating Learned Reward Functions
Suppose that we have deployed a system that uses a
learned reward function. With deployed learning systems, it is often necessary to continuously
collect data and retrain models in order to account for changing data distributions arising from a
variety of sources (Breck et al., 2017). As such, we would like to frequently retrain the reward
function on newly-collected data; however, we would also like to ensure that the reward function
has not changed “too much” from previous versions that we know to be of high quality (through
expensive deployment). Similar to the previous application, suppose that online policy evaluation is
expensive or dangerous, and that policy optimization is challenging."
REGRESSION,0.9173553719008265,"Given this problem setting, we could use reward comparisons as follows. First, learn a new reward
function on all the data collected so far. Second, compare that reward function with the old reward
function on the validation dataset of the old reward. If the comparison yields a small distance be-
tween rewards, this indicates that the reward functions are likely quite similar, thereby providing
support for continuing the process of deploying the new reward function. Alternatively, if the com-
parison yields a large distance between rewards, this indicates that the new reward is potentially quite
different from the old one, and that we should carefully inspect the cases where the rewards differ
before proceeding with deployment. In this way, we have deﬁned (part of) a validation procedure
for continuously learning and deploying reward functions."
