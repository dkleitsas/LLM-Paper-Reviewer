ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0029154518950437317,"Learning in strategy games (e.g. StarCraft, poker) requires the discovery of diverse
policies. This is often achieved by iteratively training new policies against existing
ones, growing a policy population that is robust to exploit. This iterative approach
suffers from two issues in real-world games: a) under ﬁnite budget, approximate
best-response operators at each iteration needs truncating, resulting in under-trained
good-responses populating the population; b) repeated learning of basic skills at
each iteration is wasteful and becomes intractable in the presence of increasingly
strong opponents. In this work, we propose Neural Population Learning (NeuPL)
as a solution to both issues. NeuPL offers convergence guarantees to a population
of best-responses under mild assumptions. By representing a population of policies
within a single conditional model, NeuPL enables transfer learning across policies.
Empirically, we show the generality, improved performance and efﬁciency of
NeuPL across several test domains1. Most interestingly, we show that novel
strategies become more accessible, not less, as the neural population expands."
ABSTRACT,0.0058309037900874635,"The need for learning not one, but a population of strategies is rooted in classical game theory.
Consider the purely cyclical game of rock-paper-scissors, the performance of individual strate-
gies is meaningless as improving against one entails losing to another. By contrast, performance
can be meaningfully examined between populations. A population consisting of pure strategies
{rock, paper} does well against a singleton population of {scissors} because in the meta-game where
both populations are revealed, a player picking strategies from the former can always beat a player
choosing from the latter2. This observation underpins the unifying population learning framework of
Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO) where a new policy is trained to best-respond to a mixture
over previous policies at each iteration, following a meta-strategy solver (Lanctot et al., 2017). Most
impressively, Vinyals et al. (2019) explored the strategy game of StarCraft with a league of policies,
using a practical variation of PSRO. The league counted close to a thousand sophisticated deep RL
agents as the population collectively became robust to exploits."
ABSTRACT,0.008746355685131196,"Unfortunately, such empirical successes often come at considerable costs. Population learning
algorithms with theoretical guarantees are traditionally studied in normal-form games (Brown, 1951;
McMahan et al., 2003) where best-responses can be solved exactly. This is in stark contrast to
real-world Game-of-Skills (Czarnecki et al., 2020) — such games are often temporal in nature, where
best-responses can only be approximated with computationally intensive methods (e.g. deep RL). This
has two implications. First, for a given opponent, one cannot efﬁciently tell apart good-responses that
temporarily plateaued at local optima from globally optimal best-responses. As a result, approximate
best-response operators are often truncated prematurely, according to hand-crafted schedules (Lanctot
et al., 2017; Mcaleer et al., 2020). Second, real-world games often afford strategy-agnostic transitive"

ABSTRACT,0.05539358600583091,"This iterative and isolated approach is fundamentally at odds with human learning. For humans,
mastering diverse strategies often facilitates incremental strategic innovation and learning about
new strategies does not stop us from revisiting and improving upon known ones (Caruana, 1997;
Krakauer et al., 2006). In this work, we make progress towards endowing artiﬁcial agents with
similar capability by extending population learning to real-world games. Speciﬁcally, we propose
NeuPL, an efﬁcient and general framework that learns and represents diverse policies in symmetric
zero-sum games within a single conditional network, using the computational infrastructure of simple
self-play (Section 1.2). Theoretically, we show that NeuPL converges to a sequence of iterative
best-responses under certain conditions (Section 1.3). Empirically, we illustrate the generality of
NeuPL by replicating known results of population learning algorithms on the classical domain of rock-
paper-scissors as well as its partially-observed, spatiotemporal counterpart running-with-scissors
(Vezhnevets et al., 2020) (Section 2.1). Most interestingly, we show that NeuPL enables transfer
learning across policies, discovering exploiters to strong opponents that would have been inaccessible
to comparable baselines (Section 2.2). Finally, we show the appeal of NeuPL in the challenge domain
of MuJoCo Football (Liu et al., 2019) where players must continuously reﬁne their movement skills
in order to coordinate as a team. In this highly transitive game, NeuPL naturally represents a short
sequence of best-responses without the need for a carefully chosen truncation criteria (Section 2.4)."

to executing policy πi for one episode. A meta-game strategy σ thus deﬁnes a probability assignment,
or an action proﬁle, over Π. Within Π, we deﬁne U ∈RN×N ←EVAL(Π) to be the expected
payoffs between pure strategies of this meta-game or equivalently, Uij := J(πi, πj) in the underlying

a meta-graph solver (MGS) with Σ ←F(U). The former formulation is designed for iterative
optimization of approximate best-responses as in Lanctot et al. (2017) whereas the latter is motivated
by concurrent optimization over a set of population-level objectives as in Garnelo et al. (2021). In
particular, Σ ∈RN×N := {σi}N
i=1 deﬁnes N population-level objectives, with πi optimized against

NEURAL POPULATION LEARNING,0.09912536443148688,"NeuPL deviates from PSRO in two important ways. First, NeuPL suggests concurrent and continued
training of all unique policies such that no good-response features in the population prematurely
due to early truncation. Second, NeuPL represents an entire population of policies via a shared
conditional network Πθ(·|s, σ) with each policy Πθ(·|s, σi) conditioned on and optimised against a
meta-game mixture strategy σi, enabling transfer learning across policies. This representation also
makes NeuPL general: it delegates the choice of effective population sizes |UNIQUE(Σ)| ≤|Σ| = N
to the meta-graph solver F as σi = σj implies Πθ(·|s, σi) ≡Πθ(·|s, σj) (cf. Section 2.1). Finally,
NeuPL allows for cyclic interaction graphs, beyond the scope of PSRO. We discuss the generality of
NeuPL in the context of prior works in further details in Appendix D."
NEURAL POPULATION LEARNING,0.10204081632653061,"N-step Best-Responses via Lower-Triangular Graphs
A popular class of population learning
algorithms seeks to converge to a sequence of N iterative best-responses where each policy πi
is a best-response to an opponent meta-game strategy σi with support over a subset of the policy
population Π<i = {πj}j<i. In NeuPL, this class of algorithms are implemented with meta-graph
solvers that return lower-triangular adjacency matrices Σ with Σi≤j = 0. Under this constraint, σ0
becomes a zero vector, implying that Πθ(·|s, σ0) does not seek to best-respond to any policies. Similar
to the role of initial policies {π0} in PSRO (Algorithm 2), Πθ(·|s, σ0) serves as a starting point for
the sequence of N-step best-responses and any ﬁxed policy can be used. We note that this property
further allows for incorporating pre-trained policies in NeuPL, as we discuss in Appendix D.1."

(MGS) we can construct proofs that NeuPL converges to an N-step best-response. We introduce the

convergence to a unique set of policies. Certain interaction graphs are grounded, in particular, lower-
triangular graphs are one such class which describe an N-step best response. In addition, certain
MGSs are grounded, in particular, ones that operate on the sub-payoff and output a lower-triangular
interaction graph, F : U<i,<i →Σi,<i. The lower-triangular maximum entropy Nash equilibrium
(MENE) is one such grounded MGS. Therefore with sufﬁciently large N, NeuPL will converge to a

. Unlike prior works (Lanctot et al., 2017; Mcaleer et al., 2020), the effective population size
is driven by the meta-graph solver, rather than handcrafted truncation criteria. This is particularly
appealing in real-world games, where we cannot efﬁciently determine if a policy has converged to a
best-response or temporarily plateaued at local optima. In NeuPL, one needs to specify the maximum
number of policies N to be represented in the neural population, yet the population need not optimize
N distinct objectives at the start, nor is it required to converge to N distinct policies at convergence.
The number of distinct polices represented in the neural population is a function of the strategic
complexity of the game, the capacity of the neural network, the effectiveness of the ABR operator and
the nature of the meta-graph solver. We recall this property in running-with-scissors and in MuJoCo
Football, which afford varying degrees of strategic complexities."
WEIGHT,0.22448979591836735,"Stochastic Games
running-with-scissors (Vezhnevets et al., 2020) extends rock-paper-scissors to
the spatiotemporal and partially-observed setting. Using ﬁrst-person observations of the game (a 4x4
grid in front of the agent), each player collects resources representing “rock”, “paper” and “scissors”
so as to counter its opponent’s hidden inventory. At the end of an episode or when players confront
each other through “tagging”, players compare their inventories and receive rewards accordingly. To
do well, one must infer opponent behaviours from its partial observation history o≤t — if “rock”s
went missing, then the opponent may be collecting them; if the opponent ran past “scissors”, then it
may not be interested in it. We describe the environment in details in Appendix B.1. Figure 4 shows
that NeuPL with FPSRO-N leads to a population of sophisticated policies. As before, we set the initial
sink policy to be exploitable and biased towards picking up “rock”s. Early in training, we note that
the ﬁrst three policies of the neural population implement the pure-resource policies of “rock”, “paper”
and “scissors” respectively, as evidenced by their relative payoffs. In contrast to rock-paper-scissors,
the mixture of pure-resource policies is exploitable in the sequential setting, where the player can
observe its opponent before implementing a counter strategy. Indeed, policy Πθ(·|o≤, σ4) observes
and exploits, beating the mixture policies at epoch 680. Following FPSRO-N, Πθ(·|o≤, σ5) updates its
objective to focus solely on this newfound NE over ΠΣ<5

independent policy populations by their Relative Population Performance (RPP5, Appendix A.1)
across 4 independent NeuPL experiments with different maximum population sizes. As expected,
we observe that neural populations representing more best-response iterations are less exploitable.
Additionally, a population size greater than 8 has limited impact on learning, both in terms of marginal
exploitability beneﬁts and rate of improvement against smaller populations (shown in blue and or-
ange). This further mitigate the concern of using a larger maximum population size than necessary.

policies with explicit parameter sharing. Figure 6 compares the two approaches and illustrates the
signiﬁcance of transfer learning across iterations. Speciﬁcally, we verify that the shared representation
learned by training against fewer, weaker policies early in training, facilitates the learning of exploiters
to stronger, previously unseen opponents. To this end, a set of randomly initialized MPO agents with
partially transferred parameters from different epochs of the experiment shown in Figure 4 are trained
against ﬁxed mixture policies deﬁned by ΠΣ∗
θ∗, with θ∗and Σ∗= FPSRO-N(U∗) obtained at epoch
1,200 of the same experiment. In other words, the objective for each agent is to beat a ﬁxed NE over
pre-trained policies {Πθ∗(a|o≤, σ∗

of the agents for n ∈{2, 4, 7}, with transferred parameters taken at epoch 0 (red) upto 1,000 (green)."

agent with randomly initialized parameters (red) remains capable of learning an effective best

mixture policies that execute sophisticated strategies (NE over the ﬁrst 4 or 7 policies) — the
randomly initialized agent failed to counter its opponent despite prolonged training while agents with
partially transferred parameters successfully identiﬁed exploits, leveraging effective representation
of the environment dynamics and of diverse opponent strategies. By transferring skills that support
sophisticated strategic decisions across iterations, NeuPL enables the discovery of novel policies that

variants of PSRO. Since PSRO does not prescribe a truncation criteria at each iteration, we investigate
PSRO baselines with 100k and 200k gradient steps per iteration respectively. Further, we consider
the effect of continued training across iterations, by initializing new policies with the policy obtained
at the end of the preceding iteration instead of random initialization. We refer to this continued
variant as PSRO-C. All PSRO populations are initialized with the same initial policy used for the
NeuPL population. Figure 7 illustrates the quantitative beneﬁts of NeuPL, measuring RPP between a
NeuPL population of maximum population size of 8 against the ﬁnal population of 8 policies obtained
via PSRO after 7 iterations. The vertical dashed lines indicate that both the NeuPL population and
the PSRO population have cumulatively undergone identical amount of training to allow for fair
comparison. In purple, we show the effective population size of the NeuPL population which has
been shown previously in Figure 5. We make the following observations: i) with a population size
of 8, the NeuPL population successfully exploits PSRO baselines representing an equal number of
policies, even if the latter performed twice as many gradient updates; ii) the increase in RPP coincides
with an increase in the effective population size, from 5 to 8, reaching the maximum number of
distinct policies that this NeuPL population can represent; iii) the amount of training each PSRO
generation received has limited impact on the robustness of policy populations at convergence. This
corroborates our observations in Figure 6, where the agent (in red) failed to exploit strong opponents
despite continued training. Interestingly, PSRO-C proves equally exploitable. We hypothesize that
the learned policies failed to develop reusable representations that can support diverse strategic
decisions. Details of the PSRO baselines across 3 seeds are available in Appendix B.4, demonstrating
the strategic complexities captured by the PSRO baseline populations."

DOES NEUPL SCALE TO HIGHLY TRANSITIVE GAME-OF-SKILLS?"
K,0.4518950437317784,"If a game is purely transitive, all policies share the same best-response policy. In this case, self-play
offers a natural curriculum that efﬁciently converges to this best-response (Balduzzi et al., 2019).
Nevertheless, this approach is infeasible in real-world games as one cannot rule out strategic cycles
in the game without exhaustive policy search. The MuJoCo Football domain (Liu et al., 2019) is one
such example: it challenges agents to continuously reﬁne their motor control skills while coordinated
team-play intuitively suggests the presence of strategic cycles. In such games, PSRO is a challenging
proposal as it requires carefully designed truncation criteria. If an iteration terminates prematurely
due to temporary plateaus in performance, good-responses are introduced and convergence is slowed
unnecessarily; if iterations rarely terminate, then the population may unduly delay the representation
of strategic cycles. In such games, NeuPL offers an attractive proposal that retains the ability to
capture strategic cycles, but also falls back to self-play if the game appears transitive."
K,0.45481049562682213,"Figure 8 shows the learning progression of NeuPL implementing FPSRO-N in this domain, starting
with a sink policy that exerts zero torque on all actuators. We observe that Πθ(·|o≤, σ2) exploits
the sink policy by making rapid, long-range shots which is in turn countered by Πθ(·|o≤, σ3), that
intercepts shots and coordinates as a team to score. Impressively, the off-ball blue player learned to
blocked off defenders, creating scoring opportunities for its teammate. With the interaction graph
focused on the lower diagonal elements, this training regimes closely matches that of self-play. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8"

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.5043731778425656,"Prior works attempted at making population learning scalable, motivated by similar concerns as
ours. Mcaleer et al. (2020) proposed pipeline PSRO (P2SRO) which learns iterative best-responses
concurrently in a staggered, hierarchical fashion. P2SRO offers a principled way to make use of
additional computation resources while retaining the convergence guarantee of PSRO. Nevertheless,
it does not induce more efﬁcient learning per unit of computation cost, with basic skills re-learned at
each iteration albeit asynchronously. In contrast, Smith et al. (2020a) focused on the lack of transfer
learning across best-response iterations and proposed “Mixed-Oracles” where knowledge acquired
over previous iterations is accumulated via an ensemble of policies. In this setting, each policy is
trained to best-respond to a meta-game pure strategy, rather than a mixture strategy as suggested
by the meta-strategy solver. To approximately re-construct a best-response to the desired mixture
strategy, Q-mixing (Smith et al., 2020b) re-weights expert policies, instead of retraining a new policy.
In comparison, NeuPL enables transfer while optimising Bayes-optimal objectives directly."

CONDITIONAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE FOR NEUPL"

Q-learning based RL agent. In particular, the encoder, memory and policy head network modules are
shared across all policies within the neural population with the conditioning variable σ introduced at
the ﬁnal policy head layer via concatenation. This reﬂects the hypothetical Game-of-Skills geometry
proposed in Czarnecki et al. (2020), where each policy can be understood as a point within a
“spinning-top” volume. Each policy is interpreted as a combination of strategy-agnostic transitive
skills (e.g. movement skills for embodied agents; representational capability of past observations
in partially-observed games) and a cyclic strategic element that decides which mixture policy to
best-respond to, leveraging its transitive skills."

HYPER-PARAMETERS & TRAINING INFRASTRUCTURE"
REFERENCES,0.7317784256559767,"For experiments on the normal form game of rock-paper-scissors, the “Encoder” and “Memory”
components are omitted and the policy head network πθ alone is parameterized and learned, with its
only input g. The policy and action-value networks are both parameterized by 4-layer MLPs, with 32
neurons at each layer. We use a small entropy cost of 0.01, learning rates of 0.001 and 0.01 for the
main networks and the MPO dual variables (Abdolmaleki et al., 2018) respectively. As is typical
in an MPO agent, the online network parameters are copied to target networks periodically at every
10 gradient steps. For the spatiotemporal, partially observable game of running-with-scissors, we
use a small convolutional network to encode the agent’s partial observation of the environment (a
4x4 grid surrounding itself). The encoding is further concatenated with the agent’s own inventory
information and encoded through a 2-layer MLP with 256 neurons each, with relu activation. The
memory module corresponds to a recurrent LSTM network, with a hidden size of 256. The policy,
action-value networks are parameterized as 4-layer MLP networks. The learned payoff estimator
φω(σi, σj) is parameterized as a 3-layer MLP network. The learning rate of the agent networks is
set to 0.0001 while the MPO dual variables are optimized with a learning rate of 0.001. The online
network parameters are copied to target networks every 100 gradient steps. For the MuJoCo Football
environment, we used a domain speciﬁc encoder network that encodes egocentric observations
of each player individually. The state representation is then implemented as a weighted sum of
per-player embedding, using a learned attention mask. Instead of outputting a discrete categorical
action proﬁle in each state, the policy head network is trained to output a Gaussian distribution with
learned mean and variance distribution parameters. As is common in continuous control literature,
we used elu as the activation function between network components. The rest of the network
architecture and hyper-parameters remain consistent with that of running-with-scissors. The same
network architecture and hyper-parameters are used across all experiments for the same environment."

policy obtained at the end of the preceding iteration instead of random initialization as prescribed in
(Lanctot et al., 2017). We note that across all experiments, policy populations successfully recover
the rock-paper-scissors dynamics among the ﬁrst three policies. In most but not all trails, PSRO also
manages to learn a reliable exploiter of the mixture of the three pure strategies. Finally, we note that
continued training appears to facilitate the discovery of richer strategic cycles, and so does allowing
each PSRO iteration to perform more gradient updates."

SENSITIVITY TO THE CHOICE OF HYPER-PARAMETERS"
PAYOFF,0.7842565597667639,"Figure 12 investigates the sensitivity of NeuPL to the choice of hyper-parameters. In particular,
NeuPL introduces two additional hyper-parameters: the proportion of simulation episodes used for
learning pairwise empirical payoffs (σ in Algorithm 5) and the interval between interaction graph
update (T in Algorithm 5). Intuitively, if ϵ is too low, the empirical payoff estimator risk being
under-trained when its estimations are used by the meta-graph solver while a value too high would
delay the policy learning due to insufﬁcient simulation data being generated for policy learning. When
it comes to the meta-graph update interval, a value too high may slow down strategic exploration if
the approximate best-response operators have already converged to best-responses while a value too
low may lead to noisy gradients in the optimization process, as the set of learning objectives may
change too frequently."

TEST-TIME EXECUTION OF LEARNED POLICIES"
PAYOFF,0.8483965014577259,"A distinctive property of population learning is that we obtain a population of policies that can be
executed individually at test time. In NeuPL, the population of policies is jointly deﬁned by two
elements: a conditional network Πθ(·|o≤t, σ) and a set of meta-game strategies Σ = {σi}N
i=1, derived
from the empirical payoffs between policies. To execute a mixture policy deﬁned over the population,
it sufﬁce to execute Πθ(·|o≤t, ˆσ) with ˆσ ∼Pr(Σ)."

solver (Section C.2). Finally we discuss a speciﬁc function, Nash Equilibrium meta-graph solver,

over time. The second row only responds to the ﬁrst policy. Since the ﬁrst policy is static and we

INCORPORATING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE IN NEUPL"
PAYOFF,0.967930029154519,"As we alluded to in Section 1.2, the formulation of NeuPL offers a principled way to incorporate prior
knowledge in the form of pre-trained policies. In short, pre-trained policies can be incorporated in the
same way as the sink policy, with the requirement that it can only gain in-edges in the interaction graph.
Figure 13 offers an illustration of such an example, where the population includes 2 pre-trained
policies (Πθ(·|o≤t, σ1) and Πθ(·|o≤t, σ2)) while Πθ(·|o≤t, σ3) is optimized to best-respond to a
mixture over its predecessors according to a suitable meta-graph solver. As an implementation details
due to the use of neural networks, σ1 and σ2 need to be unique vectors and they need to be treated
speciﬁcally in the corresponding MGS as they no longer represent valid probability distribution and
should be excluded from policy training, similar to the treatment of the sink policy."

this section while deferring thorough investigation in this direction to dedicated future work."
PAYOFF,0.9912536443148688,"Consider an n-player general-sum game where the i-th player can play one of M i policies, the
induced meta-game corresponds to a normal-form game between n players, each selecting a policy
to execute for an episode for one player. This yields n empirical payoff tensors U = {Ui}n
i=1 with
Ui ∈RM 1×M 2···×M n the payoff tensor for player i, given all players’ policy selections."
PAYOFF,0.9941690962099126,"Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE):
in this setting, solving for NE becomes intractable but
solution concepts such as CCE could be readily used instead (Marris et al., 2021). This leads to a
solver that takes on the form P ←F(U) with P ∈RM 1×M 2···×M n a joint-distribution over the
cartesian product of policy choices across n players. This solver can thus be used in place of the
meta-strategy solver, similarly and repeatedly invoked by the meta-graph solver. Note that instead of
obtaining a marginal distribution for a given player as in NE, CCE offers the joint distribution which
can be marginalized for each player."
PAYOFF,0.9970845481049563,"Heterogeneous Neural Populations:
in the n-player setting, different players may take on dif-

heterogeneous neural populations are needed. Speciﬁcally, each player’s policies can be represented
by its own neural population of maximum capacity M i and its own n-dimensional marginal inter-
action tensor. The i-th neural population is deﬁned by a conditional model Πi
