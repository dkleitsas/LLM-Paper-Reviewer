ABSTRACT,0.0049504950495049506,"Language models can be augmented with a context retriever to incorporate knowl-
edge from large external databases. By leveraging retrieved context, the neural net-
work does not have to memorize the massive amount of world knowledge within its
internal parameters, leading to better parameter efﬁciency, interpretability and mod-
ularity. In this paper we examined a simple yet effective architecture for incorporat-
ing external context into language models based on decoupled Encoder-Decoder
architecture. We showed that such a simple architecture achieves competitive
results on auto-regressive language modeling and open domain question answer-
ing tasks. We also analyzed the behavior of the proposed model which performs
grounded context transfer. Finally we discussed the computational implications of
such retrieval augmented models."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.01485148514851485,"Transformers have proven to be powerful language models that capture an impressive amount of
world knowledge in its internal parameters and generalize to a variety of downstream tasks [39, 31].
Recently, there has been a lot of success in improving language model quality by increasing the
number of parameters in transformers, often on the order of hundreds of billion [10, 30, 38, 6].
However, the scaling of model size also contributes to the exponential rise of the computation costs,
both in terms of the number of accelerators needed and energy consumption [29]."
INTRODUCTION,0.019801980198019802,"To overcome the exponential increase in the number of parameters, one natural idea is to utilize
information retrieved from an external source such as a massive external database, therefore freeing
the neural network from having to memorize world knowledge. To this end, researchers proposed
multiple context augmented language model architectures [21, 15, 4, 44, 26]. Such architecture
typically has two components: a retriever that embeds the input sequence and retrieves relevant
context from external source through vector similarity search; a neural network that integrates both
the input and retrieved external context into the prediction of target sequence, formally:"

(1)"
INTRODUCTION,0.0297029702970297,"Here, C = {c} is a set of context retrieved from the external database D. θ′ is a self-contained
language model which predicts target sequence y based solely on the input x whereas θ corresponds
to the context augmented language model which incorporates both the input x and the retrieved
context C."
INTRODUCTION,0.034653465346534656,"One of the challenges for such context augmented language model is the computational cost of
context retrieval and incorporation, especially when multiple pieces of context is present or the
context sequence is long. In this paper, we propose a computationally efﬁcient architecture for"

INTRODUCTION,0.04455445544554455,"incorporating context based on vanilla Encoder-Decoder, which decouples the encoding of context
and the prediction of target sequence. We show that the model with such a simple architecture is
competitive when compared with customized mechanisms such as Chunked-Cross-Attention [4]
on language modeling score (as measured by bits-per-byte, BPB), while being more efﬁcient in
terms of parameter count and computation cost. Then, we deﬁne metrics to measure the utility of
the retrieved context and use it to guide the training of the retriever. We further show competitive
results on downstream tasks of question answering, and demonstrate that the model takes advantage
of the retrieved context without memorizing facts within its internal parameters. Finally, we study the
implication of context retrieval in terms of retrieval latency, accuracy and computation cost."

Related Works"
LIT REVIEW,0.06435643564356436,"Large language models, typically in the form of big neural networks, are trained with a huge amount
of training data rich in unstructured knowledge. Researchers have found that after model training, the
neural networks often end up storing a surprisingly large amount of memorized information within
its weights [2, 7] which are then leveraged as a knowledge base. Multiple hypotheses have been
developed on how components such as fully-connected layers [13] and attention layers [5] may be
responsible for such memorization behavior. While the capability of storing world knowledge is
desirable, memorization also contributes to huge model sizes and the lack of explicit control over
knowledge base, such as performing selection or updates."
LIT REVIEW,0.06930693069306931,"An alternative strategy is to enable language models to incorporate world knowledge in the form of
retrieved context from external sources, instead of having to memorize them. Multiple works have
proposed architectures that support external retrieval, usually composed of a context retriever that
searches a large external key value store and a method of integrating retrieved information."
LIT REVIEW,0.07425742574257425,"There are various ways to construct the key value store. The keys are primarily used for similarity
matching, and they can be sparse vectors such as BM25 [34], or dense embeddings extracted from
part of the model [21, 25, 40], or from pretrained embedders [12, 28], or embedders trained for
speciﬁc downstream tasks [15, 20, 41, 35, 24, 11]. The values also have various different forms. For
example, TOME [11] stores a dense embedding about the contextual information of an entity mention,
while Realm [15], RAG [26], FID [18], Retro [4], MARGE [25], DenSPI [35] and DensePhrases [24]
store the raw text as the value. Works such as kNN-LM [21] and Spalm [44] store one token as
a value. Finally the key value store is searched over using vector similarity techniques, typically
with some off-the-shelf nearest neighbor search implementations such as FAISS [19], ScaNN [14],
HNSW [27] or SPTAG [9]."
LIT REVIEW,0.07920792079207921,"There are also many different ways to integrate the retrieved context. A popular approach is to
concatenate the retrieval results with the original input and jointly process them. It has been adopted
by works such as Realm [15], RAG [26], and FiD [18]. Other works utilize some forms of cross
attention for the context integration, such as the Chunked-Cross-Attention with input conditioning
in Retro [4], kNN Attention in Memorizing Transformer [40], Memory Attention in TOME [11]
and Cross-Attention in MARGE [25]. For token level integration, kNN-LM [21] uses simple linear
interpolation while Spalm [44] uses a learned gate based on the last layer embedding. There are
also works that directly utilize the retrieval results without any integration, such as DenSPI [35] and
DensePhrases [24]. Most of the works use retrieval as a way to augment tasks such as language
modeling or question answering, with the exception of MARGE [25] where retrieval is treated as an
autoencoder bottleneck for multilingual pretraining, and is not strictly necessary for inference. We
compare representative previous works and contrast with our proposal in Table 1."

We opt to use the standard

tion HEnc is pre-computed ofﬂine and returned as “metadata” of the retrieval. Note that training of
the Encoder and Decoder is joint, while they are decoupled at inference time: the client does not
need to store parameters or the run inference on the Encoder component."

Architecture"

retrieved context. We denote the context encoder and LM decoder as Enc and Dec respectively. Given
an input token sequence x = (x1, x2, ..., xn), the task is to predict the next tokens y = (y1, y2, ..., ys)."
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.2623762376237624,"Without external context, we concatenate x before y and the task becomes a traditional auto-regressive
language modeling to predicts targets y following input (or “promopt”) x. In this setting, only the
decoder is involved (denoted as “No-retrieval”). To incorporate external context, we use c, x, y to
serve as encoder input, decoder input and decoder target respectively. We ﬁrst use a retriever to
identify the context c = (c1, c2, ..., cm) given input x, then fetch the the pre-computed encoder
output of the corresponding context tokens HEnc(c; θEnc) as output. In this setting, encoder output
HEnc is directly used by the decoder through Encoder-Decoder cross-attention to inﬂuence the ﬁnal
prediction. The decoder does not have to know the exact tokens of c that are retrieved."

Retrieval:P(yi|y<i, x1, x2, ...xn, {HEnc(c)}; θDec)"
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.2722772277227723,"Under this formulation, only decoder parameters θDec are required at inference time. The retriever
retrieves indices of the relevant context and looks up their encodings. The context encodings are
processed ahead of the time, and are completely decoupled from online operations. This is in contrast
to previous works of Realm [15], Rag [26] or Retro [4] where the interaction between input x and
context c is bi-directional, which necessitates context encoding at inference time. In our model,
information ﬂows uni-directionally from c to x and y, and that the encoding of each context c is
processed independently. On one hand, this is more restrictive than bi-directional interaction; on the
other hand, such a design ensures complete decoupling of context processing and the online language
model inference. The exact mechanism is detailed in Figure. 1."
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.27722772277227725,"Conceptually the retriever can be an arbitrary blackbox. In practice, we use a dual encoder formula-
tion [8, 16], which ﬁrst represents x as a query embedding EmbQ(x) and performs vector similarity
search over a database of D to ﬁnd the indices of documents whose document embedding has the
highest inner products with the query embedding. We then look up the context encoder outputs that
correspond to retrieved indices and return them as the retriever output."

IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.3118811881188119,"At training time, the encoder and decoder are jointly trained. We ﬁrst perform ofﬂine retrieval to
form triplets of (x, y, c), where c is retrieved by some predeﬁned retriever. The loss is masked and
only deﬁned on the targets y. Because the encoding of each context is independent and there is no
interaction between context, the attention matrix of encoder is block diagonal and we process them in
a linear loop over each diagonal block. Thus, the computation cost of both encoder and decoder at
each step is linear in the number of context."
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.31683168316831684,"For online language model inference, only the retriever and the decoder are involved. The retrieval
embedding EmbD(c) and the encoder output HEnc(c) of the context are both ofﬂine pre-processed
and prepared into the retrieval database of such associated key-value pairs. When a new input
sequence arrives, the retriever is only responsible for the approximate nearest neighbor search and
lookup of the associated value that is the pre-computed encoder output. The decoder then takes in the
input sequence and cross attends on the concatenation of pre-computed encoder output to generate the
targeted tokens. Thanks to the decoupling, neither the retriever nor the decoder needs to store encoder
parameters. Hence, such an approach is more parameter efﬁcient compared to similar works such as
Retro [4] by saving the storage and computation budget on encoder, which is helpful in “client-server”
scenario where the capacity of the “client” can be limited. When accounting the parameter count in
comparison with other models, we only need to count the decoder and cross attention parameters. We
also followed Retro’s [4] approach of excluding the embedding matrices from the parameter count."

{EmbD(c) : HEnc(c)}, where context c are the sliding window of 512 tokens with a stride of 64
tokens. We choose our hyper-parameters to be comparable to Retro: chunk size s = 64 and input
window size n = 448 (smaller than 2048 that of Retro). This also implies that the number of entries
in the database is larger than the number of articles, but smaller than the number of tokens."
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.37623762376237624,"Our training corpus is in the form of triplets (x, y, c). x and y are acquired directly by applying
sliding window on the train split of C4. Then BM25 [34] is used as a bootstrapping retriever to mine
relevant context c to from the database. The ﬁrst retrieval results with no more than 8 consecutive
token overlap with the target is used as context. Figure 2a illustrate the sliding window construction
of database as well as sequence served as input and targets. Table 2b gives the exact number of entries
in the resulting database used as external context."
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.3811881188118812,"We use mT5 [42] as the backbone architecture for our context augmented Encoder-Decoder, and
train our models from scratch. Train split is used both for training and retrieval, while validation
split is used for bits-per-byte (Bpb) evaluation. In auto-regressive language model evaluation, due to
the fact that text are crawled from web sources, there can be a non-trivial overlap of tokens between
the training and validation splits. In such cases, tokens are often “copy-pasted” from retrieved context
into targets without changing. Such copying leads to near-zero perplexity on targets and has a big
effect on ﬁnal bits-per-byte measurement. Following the discussion on dataset leakage of Retro [4],
we ﬁltered any example whose targets and context sequences have more than 8 common consecutive
tokens (correspond to 12.5% ﬁltering of Retro). We found 14.87% of the validation chunks are
removed by the ﬁltering of longest common substring."

different vocabulary. We use mT5 base, large and XL respectively without modiﬁcation, and the
results compare favorably to Retro models with similar sizes that uses customized chunked-cross-

context incorporation can be achieved with simple Encoder-Decoder cross attention, with the

set of important tokens. Intuitively, tokens of functional words such as “the”, “a”, “to” should not

(IN), coordinating conjunction (CC), etc. are less helped by context. We believe it is because their
prediction usually only depends on immediate local context. We also found that whether the target
token appeared in the context sequence or input sequence has a large impact on the improvements,

noticed a phenomenon where both models have roughly the same performance initially but the

especially true in large and XL. We suspect that decoders of larger models have higher memorization
capacity, and in the initial phase they can improve training objective without delegating memorization
to context retrieval. This is a challenge to training stability and one way to address this is by ﬁrst
“warm start” the model with 100, 000 steps of training on a subset of training data with highest 10%

forming auto-regressive language generation. To demonstrate that the proposed context augmentation
scheme is effective on downstream applications we evaluated our proposed model of decoupled
Encoder-Decoder on the OpenQA task of Natural Question [23]."
RESULTS/EXPERIMENTS,0.6386138613861386,"We use the same question and context processed by [18],
where the context is re-
trieved with DPR retriever [20].
We construct each context sequence in the format of
""title: {title} source: {source}"" and pad or trim it to 256 sentencepiece tokens. The
context sequences are then encoded by the encoder independently and simply concatenated, to ensure
there is no interaction between them."
RESULTS/EXPERIMENTS,0.6435643564356436,"The decoder is trained to receive and respond on the sequence containing both the question
and answer in format ""question: {question} \n answer:
{answer}"" similar to [4], where
""question: {question} \n answer: "" is the input prompt (and there is no loss deﬁned on
these tokens) and {answer} is the target sequence the decoder is expected to predict. Again, the
decoder cross-attends to the concatenated encoder output HEnc(c) from all the retrieved context and
the decoder is completely decoupled from encoder. It does not even have to know the exact tokens of
context sequence being returned by the retriever."
RESULTS/EXPERIMENTS,0.6485148514851485,"The model weights are initialized from T5.1.1 checkpoints [32] We jointly ﬁne-tuned the encoder and
decoder for 40, 000 steps with 20 context passages for each input of the train split, and validated
on the dev split every 1,000 steps. We used a batch size of 64, a ﬁxed learning rate of 10−4 and
Adafactor optimizer [36]. Finally, we selected the checkpoint with the best validation accuracy on
the dev split and evaluated on the test split. Each model is trained on 64 TPUv3 chips, and the
evaluation metrics is string exact match with SQuAD [33] normalization. We report our ﬁnal results
in Table 3b. Overall, the decoupled Encoder-Decoder produced competitive results on Natural
Question task, albeit being a much simpler architecture and not speciﬁcally designed for QA tasks.
We note that FiD [18] uses similar architecture. However, FiD concatenates the question with the
retrieved context passages. Therefore the context encoding is dependent on the input sequence and
needs to be computed at inference time."

run language model decoding with the original set of retrieved context to obtain “original output”:
y∗= Decode(x, C; θ); and (b) rerun model prediction but remove all context passages that contain

Computational Discussion"
CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION,0.7178217821782178,"We evaluate the computation implications of our method around inference latency and space-time trade
off. We estimate the latency based on benchmarks and publicly available packages and performance
data. In the Natural Question experiment, we use the 1.56B XL model in Table 3b, whose encoder
output have dimension of 2048 and the activation data type is bfloat16 [1]. When proﬁled on a
single TPUv3 core, it takes 200ms to encode all 20 retrieved context passages each containing 256
tokens (with paddings). This is equivalent to 10ms per context. Thanks to the decoupling of the
context encoding, the context passages encoding is done ofﬂine, and simply looked up at inference
time. Inferencing the DPR query embedder model takes around 8ms unbatched on one TPUv2
chip. We use ScaNN [14] to perform approximate similarity search on the DPR embeddings with a
dimensionality of 768, which takes roughly 12ms to retrieve 20 neighbors with recall@20=0.97 on a
single CPU core. For each passage, the uncompressed encoded embeddings have a total size of 1
MiB (sizeof(bfloat16) * 2048 * 256). When reading the encoding from an NVMe SSD with
a read throughput of 660 MB/s, the lookup takes around 1.5ms and we use another 0.8ms to transmit
of one encoding over network. End to end, it takes around 66ms ((1.5 + 0.8) * 20 + 12 + 8)
to retrieve 20 encoded passages. This is about a third of time for running inference of the encoder, and
everything except query embedder is conducted with generic hardware without accelerators which is
cheaper and consumes less energy."
CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION,0.7227722772277227,"However, one limitation of this approach is the amount of disk space and network bandwidth needed
to store and transmit all the pre-computed encodings, which scales with the dimensionality of encoder
output. We leave it for future research to reduce the encoder output size while maintaining similar
quality, which may be possible through compression, dimensionality reduction, or adding projection
layer to the encoder."
CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION,0.7277227722772277,"7
Conclusion"
CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION,0.7326732673267327,"In this paper, we advocate the design of context augmented language model based on
Encoder-Decoder architecture. Encoder-Decoder models are simple, proven and enjoy the unique
computational advantage that the context encoding and language generation are decoupled. That is,
the context encoding can be produced with ofﬂine pre-computation and caching, while the decoder
is parameter efﬁcient because it is agnostic to the encoder computation. We further demonstrated
the effectiveness of this simple architecture by comparing with competitive baselines on common
NLP tasks such as language modeling on C4 and question answering on Natural Questions. We also
analyzed the model behavior and showed the context augmentation resulted in big improvements on
content words and the model generates output grounded in retrieved context most of the time. Finally,
we estimated the latency improvement from caching enabled by the decoupled computation."

contributions and scope? [Yes]
(b) Did you describe the limitations of your work? [Yes] We mentioned the limitations in
Section 6.
(c) Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work? [No]
(d) Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to
them? [Yes]
2. If you are including theoretical results..."
OTHER,0.9752475247524752,"(a) Did you state the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results? [N/A]
(b) Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results? [N/A]
3. If you ran experiments..."
OTHER,0.9801980198019802,"(a) Did you include the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experi-
mental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)? [No] We still need to
clean up the code before it’s ready.
(b) Did you specify all the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they
were chosen)? [Yes] See Section 4 and Section 5.
(c) Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experi-
ments multiple times)? [No] It would take too long and too much resources to run each
experiment multiple times.
(d) Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type
of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)? [Yes] We reported the type of device we
used to train the model as well as the steps per second for mT5 XL model. For more
information on run time, see Appendix.
