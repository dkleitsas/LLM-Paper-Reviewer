ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.005494505494505495,"An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-
training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As
we pre-train larger models, full Ô¨Åne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters,
becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example ‚Äì deploying independent
instances of Ô¨Åne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expen-
sive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained
model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of
the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters
for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B Ô¨Åne-tuned with Adam, LoRA
can reduce the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 10,000 and the GPU
memory requirement by a factor of 3. LoRA performs on-par or better than Ô¨Åne-
tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav-
ing fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters,
no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into
rank-deÔ¨Åciency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efÔ¨Åcacy of
LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch
models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa,
DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA."

INTRODUCTION,0.04395604395604396,"Many applications in natural language processing rely on adapt-
ing one large-scale, pre-trained language model to multiple down-
stream applications. Such adaptation is usually done via Ô¨Åne-tuning,
which updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model. The ma-
jor downside of Ô¨Åne-tuning is that the new model contains as many
parameters as in the original model. As larger models are trained
every few months, this changes from a mere ‚Äúinconvenience‚Äù for
GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) or RoBERTa large (Liu et al., 2019) to a
critical deployment challenge for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with
175 billion trainable parameters.1"
INTRODUCTION,0.04945054945054945,"Many sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or
learning external modules for new tasks. This way, we only need
to store and load a small number of task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters in ad-
dition to the pre-trained model for each task, greatly boosting the
operational efÔ¨Åciency when deployed. However, existing techniques
often introduce inference latency (Houlsby et al., 2019; RebufÔ¨Ået al., 2017) by extending model
depth or reduce the model‚Äôs usable sequence length (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Ham-"

match the Ô¨Åne-tuning baselines, posing a trade-off between efÔ¨Åciency and model quality."
INTRODUCTION,0.07142857142857142,"We take inspiration from Li et al. (2018a); Aghajanyan et al. (2020) which show that the learned
over-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the
change in weights during model adaptation also has a low ‚Äúintrinsic rank‚Äù, leading to our proposed
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural
network indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers‚Äô change during
adaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure 1. Using GPT-3
175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e., r in Figure 1 can be one or two) sufÔ¨Åces even
when the full rank (i.e., d) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage- and compute-efÔ¨Åcient."
INTRODUCTION,0.07692307692307693,LoRA possesses several key advantages.
INTRODUCTION,0.08241758241758242,"‚Ä¢ A pre-trained model can be shared and used to build many small LoRA modules for dif-
ferent tasks. We can freeze the shared model and efÔ¨Åciently switch tasks by replacing the
matrices A and B in Figure 1, reducing the storage requirement and task-switching over-
head signiÔ¨Åcantly."
INTRODUCTION,0.08791208791208792,"‚Ä¢ LoRA makes training more efÔ¨Åcient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3
times when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or
maintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected,
much smaller low-rank matrices."

reading comprehension (MRC), and natural language to SQL (NL2SQL). Each downstream task is
represented by a training dataset of context-target pairs: Z = {(xi, yi)}i=1,..,N, where both xi and

AREN‚ÄôT EXISTING SOLUTIONS GOOD ENOUGH?"
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.1813186813186813,"The problem we set out to tackle is by no means new. Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens
of works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-efÔ¨Åcient. See Sec-
tion 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there
are two prominent strategies when it comes to efÔ¨Åcient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby
et al., 2019; RebufÔ¨Ået al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; R¬®uckl¬¥e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms
of the input layer activations (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;
Liu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and
latency-sensitive production scenario."
PROBLEM STATEMENT,0.18681318681318682,"Adapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency
There are many variants of adapters. We focus
on the original design by Houlsby et al. (2019) which has two adapter layers per Transformer block
and a more recent one by Lin et al. (2020) which has only one per block but with an additional
LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016). While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploit-
ing multi-task settings (R¬®uckl¬¥e et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass
the extra compute in adapter layers. This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed
to have few parameters (sometimes <1% of the original model) by having a small bottleneck di-
mension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware
parallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes
a difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a
generic scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 (Radford et al., b)
medium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a
very small bottleneck dimension (Table 1)."

we suspect makes tuning the prompt underperform other methods. We defer the study on task

r (Yang & Hu, 2021)."

gradient update to weight matrices to have full ranks during adaptation. This means that when
applying LoRA to all weight matrices and training all biases2, we roughly recover the expressiveness
of full Ô¨Åne-tuning by setting the LoRA rank r to the rank of the pre-trained weight matrices. In
other words, as we increase the number of trainable parameters 3, training LoRA roughly converges
to training the original model, while adapter-based methods converges to an MLP and preÔ¨Åx-based
methods to a model that cannot take long input sequences."

The most signiÔ¨Åcant beneÔ¨Åt comes from the reduction in

usage by up to 2/3 if r ‚â™dmodel as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the frozen
parameters. On GPT-3 175B, we reduce the VRAM consumption during training from 1.2TB to
350GB. With r = 4 and only the query and value projection matrices being adapted, the check-
point size is reduced by roughly 10,000√ó (from 350GB to 35MB)4. This allows us to train with
signiÔ¨Åcantly fewer GPUs and avoid I/O bottlenecks. Another beneÔ¨Åt is that we can switch between
tasks while deployed at a much lower cost by only swapping the LoRA weights as opposed to all
the parameters. This allows for the creation of many customized models that can be swapped in
and out on the Ô¨Çy on machines that store the pre-trained weights in VRAM. We also observe a 25%
speedup during training on GPT-3 175B compared to full Ô¨Åne-tuning5 as we do not need to calculate

Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is a sequence-to-sequence
architecture that makes heavy use of self-attention. Radford et al. (a) applied it to autoregressive lan-
guage modeling by using a stack of Transformer decoders. Since then, Transformer-based language
models have dominated NLP, achieving the state-of-the-art in many tasks. A new paradigm emerged
with BERT (Devlin et al., 2019b) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) ‚Äì both are large Transformer lan-
guage models trained on a large amount of text ‚Äì where Ô¨Åne-tuning on task-speciÔ¨Åc data after pre-
training on general domain data provides a signiÔ¨Åcant performance gain compared to training on
task-speciÔ¨Åc data directly. Training larger Transformers generally results in better performance and
remains an active research direction. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the largest single Transformer
language model trained to-date with 175B parameters."
RELATED WORKS,0.5879120879120879,"Prompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning.
While GPT-3 175B can adapt its behavior with just a
few additional training examples, the result depends heavily on the input prompt (Brown et al.,

model‚Äôs performance on a desired task, which is known as prompt engineering or prompt hacking."

RELATED WORKS,0.6043956043956044,"Parameter-EfÔ¨Åcient Adaptation.
Many have proposed inserting adapter layers between existing
layers in a neural network (Houlsby et al., 2019; RebufÔ¨Ået al., 2017; Lin et al., 2020). Our method
uses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The
key functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during
inference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3).
A comtenporary extension of adapter is COMPACTER (Mahabadi et al., 2021), which essentially
parametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing
scheme. Similarly, combining LoRA with other tensor product-based methods could potentially
improve its parameter efÔ¨Åciency, which we leave to future work. More recently, many proposed
optimizing the input word embeddings in lieu of Ô¨Åne-tuning, akin to a continuous and differentiable
generalization of prompt engineering (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al.,
2020; Liu et al., 2021). We include comparisons with Li & Liang (2021) in our experiment section.
However, this line of works can only scale up by using more special tokens in the prompt, which
take up available sequence length for task tokens when positional embeddings are learned."
RELATED WORKS,0.6098901098901099,"Low-Rank Structures in Deep Learning.
Low-rank structure is very common in machine learn-
ing. A lot of machine learning problems have certain intrinsic low-rank structure (Li et al., 2016;
Cai et al., 2010; Li et al., 2018b; Grasedyck et al., 2013). Moreover, it is known that for many
deep learning tasks, a heavily over-parametrized neural network will exhibit low-rank properties af-
ter training (Oymak et al., 2019). Some prior works even explicitly impose the low-rank constraint
when training the original neural network (Sainath et al., 2013; Povey et al., 2018; Zhang et al.,
2014; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2016; Khodak et al., 2021; Denil et al., 2014); however,
to the best of our knowledge, none of these works considers low-rank update to a frozen model
for adaptation to downstream tasks. In theory literature, it is known that neural networks outper-
form other classical learning methods, including the corresponding (Ô¨Ånite-width) neural tangent
kernels (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2018) when the underlying concept class has certain
low-rank structure (Ghorbani et al., 2020; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2019; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2020a). Another
theory result in Allen-Zhu & Li (2020b) suggests that low-rank adaptations can be useful for adver-
sarial training. In sum, we believe that our proposed low-rank adaptation update is well-motivated
by the literature."

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.6208791208791209,"Fine-tuning enormous language models is prohibitively expensive in terms of the hardware required
and the storage/switching cost for hosting independent instances for different tasks. We propose
LoRA, an efÔ¨Åcient adaptation strategy that neither introduces inference latency nor reduces input
sequence length while retaining high model quality. Importantly, it allows for quick task-switching
when deployed as a service by sharing the vast majority of the model parameters. While we focused
on Transformer language models, the proposed principles are generally applicable to any neural
networks with dense layers."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.6263736263736264,"There are many directions for future works. 1) LoRA can be combined with other efÔ¨Åcient adapta-
tion methods, potentially providing orthogonal improvement. 2) The mechanism behind Ô¨Åne-tuning
or LoRA is far from clear ‚Äì how are features learned during pre-training transformed to do well
on downstream tasks? We believe that LoRA makes it more tractable to answer this than full Ô¨Åne-
tuning. 3) We mostly depend on heuristics to select the weight matrices to apply LoRA to. Are
there more principled ways to do it? 4) Finally, the rank-deÔ¨Åciency of ‚àÜW suggests that W could
be rank-deÔ¨Åcient as well, which can inspire future works."
