ABSTRACT,0.0017452006980802793,"Recently developed quasi-Bayesian (QB) methods [29] proposed a stimulating
change of paradigm in Bayesian computation by directly constructing the Bayesian
predictive distribution through recursion, removing the need for expensive compu-
tations involved in sampling the Bayesian posterior distribution. This has proved
to be data-efficient for univariate predictions, however, existing constructions for
higher dimensional densities are only possible by relying on restrictive assumptions
on the model’s multivariate structure. Here, we propose a wholly different ap-
proach to extend Quasi-Bayesian prediction to high dimensions through the use of
Sklar’s theorem, by decomposing the predictive distribution into one-dimensional
predictive marginals and a high-dimensional copula. We use the efficient recursive
QB construction for the one-dimensional marginals and model the dependence
using highly expressive vine copulas. Further, we tune hyperparameters using
robust divergences (eg. energy score) and show that our proposed Quasi-Bayesian
Vine (QB-Vine) is a fully non-parametric density estimator with an analytical form
and convergence rate independent of the dimension of the data in some situations.
Our experiments illustrate that the QB-Vine is appropriate for high dimensional
distributions (∼64), needs very few samples to train (∼200) and outperforms state-
of-the-art methods with analytical forms for density estimation and supervised
tasks by a considerable margin."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.005235602094240838,"The estimation of joint densities is a cornerstone of machine learning as a looking glass into the
underlying data-generating process of multivariate data. Methods that support explicit density
evaluation are crucial in probabilistic modelling, with applications in variational methods [58, 85],
Importance Sampling [2, 67], Sequential Monte Carlo [41], Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
[92, 49] and simulation-based inference [81, 62]. A prominent example are Normalising Flows (NF)
[80, 24, 82], leveraging deep networks with invertible transformations for analytical expressions and
sampling. Despite impressive performances, they require meticulous manual hyperparameter tuning
and large amounts of data to train. Bayesian methods are another attractive approach for analytical
density modelling where the central object of interest is the predictive density, with the Dirichlet
Process Mixture Model (DPMM) [46] as the canonical nonparametric choice. Similar to kernel
density estimation, the DPMM can be interpreted as an infinite mixture of densities. It is composed
of a density called a kernel, with a fixed parametric form, and of a mixing density responsible for
assigning those parameters. The specification of this kernel and mixing density is thus important"
INTRODUCTION,0.006980802792321117,"as they regulate the expressivity of a DPMM. However, the computation of the DPMM’s predictive
density is laborious as it relies on expensive MCMC methods scaling poorly to high-dimensions1."
INTRODUCTION,0.008726003490401396,"Recently, [29] proposed an appealing shift in Bayesian methods through the efficient constructions of
Quasi-Bayesian (QB) sequences of predictive densities using only recursion, thereby circumventing
the need for MCMC in Bayesian inference, and inspiring an offspring of works utilising this method-
ology [28, 59, 35, 26, 99, 69, 101]. The seminal univariate Recursive Bayesian Predictive (R-BP)
[43], its multivariate (Rd-BP) extension [29] and the AutoRegressive Bayesian Predictive (AR-BP)
[35] are all QB models targeting the predictive mean of the DPMM, with an analytical recursive form
driven by bivariate copula updates. Notably, the AR-BP demonstrated superior density estimation
capabilities compared to a suite of competitors on varied supervised and unsupervised datasets, is
orders of magnitude faster than standard Bayesian methods and is data-efficient, i.e. does not require
large amounts of training data to be effective."
INTRODUCTION,0.010471204188481676,"In multivariate QB predictives, to derive analytical expressions, it is necessary to enforce assumptions
on the DPMM kernel structure. The kernel of the Rd-BP is set to be independent across dimensions,
where this strong assumption is too constraining for more complex data. This is relaxed in the
AR-BP through an autoregressive form of the kernel, where each kernel mean is a similarity function
of previous dimensions modelled through a covariance function or a deep autoregressive network,
depending on the complexity of the data. The former relies on a fixed form that is often too simplistic
while the latter loses the appeal of a data-efficient predictive like in the Rd-BP. Here, we posit that
these assumptions, required for obtaining existing recursions, lack the flexibility to model multivariate
data accurately."
INTRODUCTION,0.012216404886561954,"In this paper, we introduce the Quasi-Bayesian Vine (QB-Vine) as a more general approach to forming
multivariate QB recursions, utilising a copula decomposition to circumvent restrictive assumptions on
the DPMM kernel. The QB-Vine is obtained by applying Sklar’s theorem [91] to the joint predictive,
thereby dissecting it into univariate marginal predictive densities and a multivariate copula. Marginal
predictives are modelled with the data-efficient univariate R-BP while the multivariate copula is
modelled with a simplified vine copula - a highly flexible copula model suited for high dimensions.
Compared to the sequential constructions of previous work, the QB-Vine is inherently parallelizable
over dimensions instead of sequential. The main contributions of our work are as follows:"
INTRODUCTION,0.013961605584642234,"• The copula decomposition frees us from the need to assume specific kernel structures of the
DPMM, but preserves the data efficiency of QB methods while making it more effective on
high-dimensional data."
INTRODUCTION,0.015706806282722512,"• Under certain assumptions on the true dependence structure within the data, we show that
the QB-Vine attains a convergence rate that is independent of the dimension."
INTRODUCTION,0.017452006980802792,"• The above decomposition of the joint density and use of the energy score to tune hyperparam-
eters makes the QB-Vine amenable to efficient parallelisation with significant computational
gains."
INTRODUCTION,0.019197207678883072,"Our paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we introduce Quasi-Bayesian prediction, recapitulating
the R-BP construction. In Section 3 we formulate the Quasi-Bayesian Vine model. We provide a
succinct survey of related work in Section 4 and compare related methods to the QB-Vine in Section 5
on a range of datasets for density estimation, regression, and classification, achieving state-of-the-art
performance with our model. We conclude with a discussion in Section 6."

derive the correct Bayesian update under a DPMM for step 1 and use it for all future steps m > 1

the need to evaluate a normalising constant (as is the case in Newton’s algorithm, a similar recursion
for a DPMM’s predictive [75, 74]). Consequently, the R-BP is free from the reliance on MCMC to
approximate a posterior density, making it much faster than regular DPMMs. While this formulation
does not correspond to a Bayesian model, as argued by [7, 10, 29, 50], if the recursive updates
are conditionally identically distributed (as is the case for the recursion of (3)), they still exhibit
desirable Bayesian characteristics such as coherence, regularization, and asymptotic exchangeability,

an introduction. In practice, we use a simplified vine copula model [70, 71] which removes the
conditional dependence of each of the copula cij on Sij. This is an approximation which reduces the
complexity of the model for dependency structure but provides significant computational gains by
reducing the size of the model space. An example simplified vine model in d = 3 is shown below:"

We begin by choosing a Cauchy distribution as the initial predictive

(0) ∀i = 1, . . . , d, with details provided in Appendix
E. The hyperparameter ρ for the R-BP recursion is assumed different for each marginal predictive (i.e.
ρd). Unlike previous R-BP works [43, 29, 35], the QB-Vine minimize the energy score to select ρd
rather than the log-score, both of which are strictly proper scoring rules (see Appendix C and [78]) and
define statistical divergences. This choice was motivated by the robustness properties of the energy
score [77]. The energy score is computed between observations and J = 100 predictive samples from
our marginal models conditional on previously observed data. As the R-BP is sensitive to the ordering
of the data, we follow [29, 35] by averaging the resulting R-BP marginal over M = 10 permutations
of the data (see [97, 22] for a discussion regarding the need of averaging over permutations)."

that transforms y to a continuous scale by setting negative examples to −10, and positive examples to
10 and adds standard Gaussian noise to all examples, breaking ties on a distribution scale (a common
approach taken in similar contexts [55, 61, 44]). The rationale behind this approximation is that by
setting the two classes far apart on a marginal scale, we ensure no overlaps occur, thereby maintaining
a clear cut-off between the classes on the distribution scale. Indeed, the separating boundary between
the classes on a distribution scale will be the percentile q =
T0
T1+T0 where T0 and T1 are the
numbers of negative and positive samples, respectively, in the training set. Consequently, we create
different clusters in the copula [0, 1]d hypercube according to the separation on the distributional

Related Work"
RELATED WORK,0.17801047120418848,"Our method shares similarities with existing work on QB predictive density estimation with analytical
forms. The pivotal works of [75, 74] and the ensuing Predictive Recursion (PR) [37, 65, 66, 97, 63,
36, 64] propose a recursive solution to the same problem but are restrained to low dimensional settings
due to the numerical integration of a normalising constant over a space scaling with d. A sequential
importance sampling strategy for PR is proposed in [23] termed as PRticle Filter. The R-BP of [43]
and the multivariate extensions in [29, 35] also have a recursive form driven by bivariate copula
updates. In the multivariate case, imposing assumptions on the kernel structure leads to a conditional
factorisation of the joint predictive which recovers bivariate copula updates. In [35], an autoregressive
Bayesian predictive (AR-BP) is used, where the dependence is captured by dimension-wise similarity
functions modelled with kernels or deep autoregressive networks. The former relies on assumptions
that might be too simplistic to capture complex data while the latter loses the appeal of a data-efficient
predictive like in the R-BP. The Quasi-Bayesian Vine retains the advantages of the bivariate copula-
based recursion for marginal predictives and circumvents the need for assumptions on the DPMM
kernel. We achieve this via approximating the high-dimensional dependency through a simplified
vine copula which is highly flexible and does not use a deep network to preserve data-efficiency, all
the while maintaining an analytical expression. A relevant benchmark are the NFs of [80, 24] with
analytical densities with a state-of-the-art performance across data types and tasks."

is due to the high number of samples relative to the dimension, preventing our approach from fully
exploiting the vine copula decomposition. Once again, the performance of the QB-Vine more clearly
exceeds that of competitors as dimensions increase. The QB-Vine has higher standard errors than
other methods (except MLP), which we posit is the consequence of our conditional estimator in

DISCUSSION,0.21291448516579406,"We introduced the Quasi-Bayesian Vine, a joint Bayesian predictive density estimator with an
analytical form and easy to sample from. This extends the existing works on Quasi-Bayesian
predictive densities, by using Sklar’s theorem to decompose the predictive density into predictive
marginals and a copula to model the high-dimensional dependency. This decomposition enables
a two-part estimation procedure, employing Quasi-Bayesian recursive density estimation for the
marginals and fitting a simplified vine copula for the dependence, resulting in a convergence rate
independent of dimension for certain joint densities. We empirically demonstrate the advantage of
QB-Vine on a range of datasets compared to other benchmark methods, showing excellent modeling
capabilities in large dimensions with only a few training data."
DISCUSSION,0.21465968586387435,"However, there is potential for further improvements. The main bottleneck of the QB-Vine is
the simplified vine, both computationally and methodologically. The non-uniqueness of the vine
decomposition resulting in a search over an exponentially large model space during estimation and the
hyperparameter selection of the KDE pair copulas could both lead to misspecified models. Further,
our main assumption is the use of a simplified vine copula which is only an approximation to the true
distribution. While these concerns stem from limited effective copula models for high dimensions
being available, from a practical point of view, a simplified vine offers tractable and fast likelihood
evaluations, and ultimately outperforms competitors as shown in experiments."
DISCUSSION,0.2164048865619546,"Future directions of this work include the incorporation of more effective copula models, or copulas
accommodating different dependence structures [98, 73, 51]. Another exciting direction are develop-
ments of new recursive Quasi-Bayes methods that can be merged into a Quasi-Bayesian Vine model
[33]."

lacks the desired flexibility to capture more complex dependencies involving multiple dimensions.
Among nonparametric copulas, Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) copulas [34] are commonly used.
They apply an inverse Gaussian distribution to the observed {ui}d
i=1 to map them to a latent space
and perform regular KDE on the latent density. However, this KDE copula method suffers from the
poor scaling of KDE estimators in higher dimensions. Finally, deep learning copula models remain a
nascent line of research and typically are more computationally expensive and sample-dependent due
to their reliance on large models, with only a handful of candidate solutions such as [60, 56, 53, 3].
As such, current copula models are mostly limited to low to medium-dimensional modelling[54]."

evaluate the energy score for 50 values between 2 and 4, as these ranges were appraised to give the
best fits on preliminary runs on train data. We note the hyperparameter selection of ρ also supports
gradient-based optimisation (see Appendix C), which we utilise in the Gaussian Mixture Model
experiments in Appendix E.1. In general, gradient-based optimisation of ρ converges within less than
five iterations. For energy score evaluations, with marginal predictives, we sample 100 observations
and compare them to the training data, while for the copula we simulate 100 samples from the joint
to compare with the energy score against training data.

Other datasets require about half an hour for five runs in parallel, while the Gaussian Mixture study
had a total time of 4 hours. The PRticle Filter takes about two hours on all density estimation tasks
combined. The RQ-NSF experiments on Gaussian Mixture Models took about 4 hours combined.

In practice, the initial choice of P(0) is made to reflect the support

natural choice is the standard Gaussian N(0, 1). However, given distribution transformations are
used throughout the recursion, if observations fall in the tails of the predictive density, numerical
overflow might make them redundant, lowering the accuracy of our approach. Therefore, it is
desirable to have heavier tails than those of the true distribution to capture outliers accurately. This
coincides with the theory on such recursion requiring heavier tails for the initial predictive compared
to those of the data, see the assumptions on P(0) in [97, 64] and [43, 29]. As such, our default choice
is a standard Cauchy distribution."

times with different seeds, leading to different GMM models. Figure 2 shows the LPS over the 5
runs for each method and dimension. Further, as the generating distribution is known, we sample
from the fitted models and evaluate their samples under the true GMM density (known as the reverse
KL divergence, lower is better), reported in Figure 3. Finally, we compute the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) as a commonly used measure that compares samples to observations, reported
in Table 7. The MMD assess how close the model is to the true data-generating process by comparing
model samples to observed data, with a lower MMD score implying a better fit for the data. The

Table 7: Comparison of the MMD (lower is better) computed on samples from the QBVine and
RQNSF models across different dimensions and GMMs. Each cell shows the QBVine value on top
and the RQNSF value on the bottom, separated by a dotted line. The QB-Vine outperforms the
RQNSF in all cases considered, demonstrating better sample quality via this metric."

CLAIMS,0.9685863874345549,1. Claims
CLAIMS,0.9703315881326352,"Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: ‘We claimed to provide a new density estimation scheme with analytical form
which used smaller data to train and can handle a large dimensional space. We showed that
our proposed QB-Vine has outperformed other benchmark methods for many benchmark
dataset in the experimental section, providing strength to our claim. Further we proved
theoretically that our proposed method has a dimension-independent convergence rate when
the dependency of the true model satisfies the assumptions of a simplified vine copula.
2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.9720767888307156,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main limitation of the method is the use of simplified vine copula which is
an approximation to the true distribution. We discuss this in the discussion but also point that
this apparent limitation gives us advantages in the sense of fast computation and achieving
best results compared to the benchmark methods.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs"
CLAIMS,0.9738219895287958,"Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the statements of our main theorems in Section 3 and the proofs
of the theorems in the Appendix. To our belief, we have explained all the assumptions (eg.
assumption of simplified vine copula) in the statements and we believe the proofs provided
are correct and rigorous.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility"
CLAIMS,0.9755671902268761,"Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The experiments are done on publicly available benchmark datasets using
other benchmark methods. We provide all the code necessary to reproduce the results as
supplementary material.
5. Open access to data and code"
CLAIMS,0.9773123909249564,"Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided the data and code as the supplementary material with this
paper. Further we host all of this in a personal Github repository, as soon as the reviewing is
done we would make that repository public for better public access to our code and data.
