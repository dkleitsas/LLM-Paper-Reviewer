ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.006944444444444444,"The non-robustness of neural network policies to adversarial examples poses a
challenge for deep reinforcement learning. One natural approach to mitigate the
impact of adversarial examples is to develop methods to detect when a given input
is adversarial. In this work we introduce a novel approach for detecting adversarial
examples that is computationally efﬁcient, is agnostic to the method used to gen-
erate adversarial examples, and theoretically well-motivated. Our method is based
on a measure of the local curvature of the neural network policy, which we show
differs between adversarial and clean examples. We empirically demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the Atari environment against a large set of state-of-
the-art algorithms for generating adversarial examples. Furthermore, we exhibit
the effectiveness of our detection algorithm with the presence of multiple strong
detection-aware adversaries."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.020833333333333332,"Since Mnih et al. (2015) showed that deep neural networks can be used to parameterize reinforce-
ment learning policies, there has been substantial growth in new algorithms and applications for
deep reinforcement learning. While this progress has resulted in a variety of new capabilities for
reinforcement learning agents, it has at the same time introduced new challenges due to the non-
robustness of DNNs to imperceptible adversarial perturbations originally discovered by Szegedy
et al. (2014). In particular, Huang et al. (2017); Kos & Song (2017) showed that the non-robustness
of DNNs to adversarial perturbations extends to the deep reinforcement learning domain, where ap-
plications such as self-driving cars or automatic ﬁnancial trading cannot tolerate such a vulnerability."
INTRODUCTION,0.027777777777777776,"In the setting of image classiﬁcation there has been signiﬁcant effort to make DNNs robust to ad-
versarial perturbations Goodfellow et al. (2015); Madry et al. (2018). At the same time, there is a
line of work focused on showing the inevitability of adversarial examples and the intrinsic difﬁculty
of learning robust classiﬁers Dohmatob (2019); Mahloujifar et al. (2019); Gourdeau et al. (2019).
Given that it may not be possible to make DNNs completely robust to adversarial examples, a natu-
ral objective is to instead attempt to detect the presence of adversarial examples Pang et al. (2018);
Yang et al. (2020); Cintas et al. (2020). Additional work has shown that many adversarial defense
and detection methods fail in the white-box setting where the adversary is aware of both the trained
model and the method used to detect examples Athalye et al. (2018); Carlini & Wagner (2017b)."
INTRODUCTION,0.034722222222222224,"In this paper we propose a novel detection method for adversarial examples in deep reinforcement
learning. This is the ﬁrst method for detecting adversarial examples in this setting, where compu-
tational efﬁciency is paramount since the method must be applied in real-time to every state en-
countered by the agent. Our approach relies on differences in the curvature of the neural policy in
the neighborhood of an adversarial example when compared to a natural example. At a high level
our method is based on the intuition that while natural examples have neighborhoods determined
by an optimization procedure intended to learn a policy that works well across all states, each ad-
versarial example is the output of some local optimization in the neighborhood of one particular
state. Our proposed method is computationally efﬁcient, requiring only one gradient computation
and two policy evaluations, requires no training that depends on the adversarial attack method, and"

the authors show that the state-of-the-art adversarial training techniques introduce a new set of non-

RELATED WORK AND BACKGROUND,0.1388888888888889,"Detection of Adversarial Examples: There has been a long line of work on detection of adver-
sarial examples for image classiﬁcation. Metzen et al. (2017) proposed augmenting standard neural
network image classiﬁers with a sub-network trained speciﬁcally to detect adversarial examples.
However, this method has a cost of separately training a binary classiﬁer to be able to detect the
adversarial examples. Pang et al. (2018) proposed a modiﬁed neural network training strategy that is
combined with a test-time thresholding method to distinguish adversarial from clean examples with
additional training cost. Yang et al. (2020) studied detection of adversarial examples via feature
attribution, utilizing the Leave-One-Out (LOO) attribution method proposed by Li et al. (2016). The
LOO method is based on erasing each pixel of the image and observing how the output of the neural
network changes, and so requires a number of neural network classiﬁer evaluations equal to the res-
olution of the input image. Finally, Roth et al. (2019) suggest a statistical test based on measuring
the average change in the odds ratio between classes under random perturbations. Evaluation of the
neural classiﬁer at hundreds of randomly perturbed samples are required in order for this method
to get sufﬁciently accurate estimates of the average change in order to detect adversarial examples.
In contrast to prior methods, our detection method does not require modifying the training of the
neural network, does not require any training speciﬁc to the attack method used, and uses only two
neural network function evaluations and one gradient computation."

FIRST-ORDER DETECTION OF ADVERSARIES WITH TAYLOR APPROXIMATION,0.20833333333333334,"As a naive baseline we ﬁrst describe a detection method based on estimating how much the cost
function J(s, τ) varies under small perturbations. Prior work on detection of adversarial examples
Roth et al. (2019); Hu et al. (2019) has shown that the behavior of DNN classiﬁers under small,
random perturbations is different at clean versus adversarial examples. Therefore, a natural baseline
detection method is: given an input state s0 sample a small random perturbation η ∼N(0, ϵI) and
compute,
K(s0, η) = J(s0 + η, π∗(·|s0)) −J(s0, π∗(·|s0)).

The ﬁrst-order detection method proceeds by ﬁrst estimating the mean and the variance of K over
a clean run of the agent in the environment. Next a threshold t is chosen so that a desired false
positive rate (FPR) is achieved (i.e. some desired fraction of the states in the clean run lie more"

classiﬁed as adversarial if it is at least t standard deviations away from the mean. Otherwise the
state is classiﬁed as clean. As a ﬁrst attempt, the ﬁrst-order method can be naturally interpreted
as a ﬁnite-difference approximation to the magnitude of the gradient at s0. If we assume that the
ﬁrst-order Taylor approximation of J is accurate in a ball of radius r > ϵ centered at s0, then"

Thus, for η ∼N(0, ϵI) the test statistic K(s0, η) is approximately distributed as a Gaussian with
mean 0 and variance ϵ2∥∇sJ(s0, π∗(·|s0))∥2. Under this interpretation one would expect the test
statistics for clean and adversarial states to have the same mean with potentially different standard
deviations, possibly making it hard to distinguish clean from adversarial. However, this is not what
we observe empirically, and in fact the ﬁrst-order method does a decent job of detecting adversarial
examples. The method works because, in fact, the mean of K(¯s, η) for clean examples ¯s is rea-
sonably well separated from the mean of K(sadv, η) for adversarial examples sadv. The empirical
performance of the ﬁrst-order method thus indicates that the assumption of accuracy for the ﬁrst-
order Taylor approximation of J does not hold in practice. This leads naturally to the consideration
of information on the second derivatives of J in order to detect adversarial examples."

SECOND-ORDER DETECTION OF ADVERSARIES WITH TAYLOR APPROXIMATION,0.25,"The second-order detection method is based on measuring the local curvature of the cost function
J(s, τ). The method exploits the fact that J(s, τ) will have larger negative curvature at a clean
example as compared to an adversarial example. In particular, the high level theoretical motiva-
tion for this approach is that adversarial examples are the output of a local optimization procedure
which attempts to ﬁnd a nearby perturbed state sadv with a low value for the cost J(sadv, τ) for some
τ ̸= π∗(·|¯s). A direction of large negative curvature for J(sadv, τ) indicates that a very small pertur-
bation along this direction could dramatically decrease the cost function. Therefore, such points are
likely to be unstable for local optimization procedures attempting to minimize the cost function in a
small neighborhood. On the other hand, the curvature of J(s, τ) at a clean state ¯s is determined by
the overall algorithm used to train the deep reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm optimizes
the parameters of the neural network policy while considering all states visited during training, and
thus is not likely to be heavily overﬁt to the state ¯s. In particular, we expect larger negative curva-
ture at ¯s than at an adversarial example sadv. We make the connection between negative curvature
and instability for local optimization formal in Section 3.3. Based on the above discussion, a natural
choice of metric for distinguishing adversarial versus clean examples is the most negative eigenvalue

requires computing the eigenvalues of a matrix whose number of entries are quadratic in the input
dimension. Since the input is very high-dimensional, and we would like to perform this computa-
tion in real-time for every state visited by the agent, computing the value λmin is computationally
prohibitive. Instead we approximate this value by measuring the curvature along a direction which
is correlated with the negative eigenvectors of the Hessian. Given this direction, the value that we
measure is the accuracy of the ﬁrst order Taylor approximation of the cost of the given state J(s, τ).

∇sJ(s, τ) points in a direction that decreases the distance function Ds0(s∗). Thus sufﬁciently
negative curvature in the direction of ∇sJ(s, τ) implies not only that s is not a local minimum of
f, but also that the distance function Ds0(s) can be decreased by moving along this direction of
negative curvature. To summarize, we have shown that second order optimality conditions arising

particular the FGSM-based methods and DeepFool do not explicitly optimize an objective function
of the form f(s) = J(s, τ) + Ds0(s) as in Assumption 3.1. However, by enforcing a constraint on
the distance of the adversarial example from the original clean example, these methods implicitly
solve an optimization problem of the form given in (14), and thus exhibit the qualitative behavior

TPR values by all the detection methods, the perturbations computed by Carlini&Wagner and the

DETECTION AWARE ADVERSARY,0.6388888888888888,"Recently, Tramer et al. (2020) introduced a comprehensive methodology for tailoring the optimiza-
tion procedure used to produce adversarial examples in order to overcome detection and defense
methods. In particular, the high level idea is to keep the attack as simple as possible while still
accurately targeting the detection method. More speciﬁcally, the methodology is based on designing
an attack based on gradient descent on some loss function. Further, minimizing the loss function
should correspond closely to subverting the full detection method while still being possible to op-
timize. Critically, the authors highlight that while the choice of loss function to optimize can be a
difﬁcult task, the use of “feature matching” Gowal et al. (2019) can circumvent most of the current
detection methods. We now describe how we applied the methodology from Tramer et al. (2020) to
design detection aware adversaries for SO-DATA. As a ﬁrst attempt, we tested the “feature match-
ing” approach that was used to break the Roth et al. (2019) detection method in Tramer et al. (2020).
This approach attempts to match the logits of the adversarial example to those of a clean example
from a different class in order to evade detection. To optimize the loss for this method we used up
to 1000 PGD iterations, and we searched step size varying from 0.01 to 10−6. We ﬁnd that this
method succeeds in reducing the TPR of the Roth et al. (2019) method to nearly zero. It is also
able to slightly reduce the TPR of our SO-DATA method (see results in Table 2). However, as we
will see next, a larger reduction in the TPR of SO-DATA can be achieved by optimizing a modiﬁed
version of the loss from Carlini & Wagner (2017b). Our next attempt is based on a modiﬁcation of"

DETECTION AWARE ADVERSARY,0.6805555555555556,"Recall that L(s) is consistently larger at adversarial examples than at clean examples. Thus the
above optimization problem attempts to ﬁnd adversarial examples with as small values of L(s) as
possible. Since the function L(s) involves taking the sign of the gradient, we use Backwards Pass
Differentiable Approximation (BPDA) as introduced in Carlini & Wagner (2017b) to compute the
gradients. However, we also tried designing an adversary with a fully differentiable cost function
by using a perturbation in the gradient direction (without the sign). We found that this fully dif-
ferentiable adversary performed signiﬁcantly worse than the one based on BPDA. We conducted
exhaustive grid search over all the parameters in this optimization method: learning rate, iteration
number, conﬁdence parameter κ, and objective function parameter λ. In C&W we used up to 30000
iterations to ﬁnd adversarial examples to bypass detection methods. We searched the conﬁdence
parameter from 0 to 50, the learning rate from 0.001 to 0.1, and λ from 0.001 to 10. In our grid
search over these hyperparameters we found that there is a trade-off between the attack success rate
and the detection of the perturbations. In other words, if we optimize the perturbation to be unde-
tectable the success rate of the perturbation (i.e. the rate at which the perturbation actually makes
the agent choose a non-optimal action) decreases. Therefore, when ﬁnalizing the hyperparameters
for the SO-DATA detection-aware adversary we restricted our search to a setting where the decrease
in the success rate of the attack was at most 10%. Since FO-DATA is based on sampling a random"

50 samples from the same noise source. As for the case of SO-DATA we grid search over hyper-
parameters to achieve as low a TPR as possible while losing at most 10% in the success rate of the
attack. Table 3 shows the TPR in the adversary-aware setting with the best hyperparameters found
for each method. The fact that SO-DATA still performs quite well in the adversary-aware setting is
an indication that there is a fundamental trade-off between computing an adversarial example and
minimizing L(s). This trade-off makes sense in light of Proposition 3.1, which shows that searching
for an adversarial example in a small neighborhood will tend to increase L(s)."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.7222222222222222,"In this paper we introduced DATA, the ﬁrst method for detection of adversarial attacks in deep re-
inforcement learning. Our method was theoretically motivated by the fact that local optimization
objectives corresponding to the construction of adversarial examples lead naturally to lower bounds
on the curvature of the cost function J(s, τ). We have further shown empirically that the curvature
of J(s, τ) is signiﬁcantly larger at adversarial examples than at clean examples, leading to a highly
effective method SO-DATA for detecting adversarial examples in deep reinforcement learning. We
additionally demonstrate that SO-DATA remains effective in the adversary-aware setting, and con-
nect this fact to our original theoretical motivation. We believe that due to the strong empirical
performance and solid theoretical motivation SO-DATA can be an important step towards producing
robust deep reinforcement learning agents."
