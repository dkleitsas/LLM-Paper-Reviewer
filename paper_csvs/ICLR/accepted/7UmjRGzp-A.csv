ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0013458950201884253,"Most graph neural networks (GNNs) use the message passing paradigm, in which
node features are propagated on the input graph. Recent works pointed to the
distortion of information ﬂowing from distant nodes as a factor limiting the efﬁ-
ciency of message passing for tasks relying on long-distance interactions. This
phenomenon, referred to as ‘over-squashing’, has been heuristically attributed to
graph bottlenecks where the number of k-hop neighbors grows rapidly with k. We
provide a precise description of the over-squashing phenomenon in GNNs and
analyze how it arises from bottlenecks in the graph. For this purpose, we introduce
a new edge-based combinatorial curvature and prove that negatively curved edges
are responsible for the over-squashing issue. We also propose and experimentally
test a curvature-based graph rewiring method to alleviate the over-squashing."

INTRODUCTION,0.006729475100942127,"The vast majority of GNNs follow the

INTRODUCTION,0.008075370121130552,"Some of the drawbacks of the message passing paradigm have now been identiﬁed and formalized,

messages being propagated from distant nodes. Alon & Yahav (2021) proposed rewiring the graph

over-squashing. This approach is in line with multiple other results e.g. using connectivity diffusion

based on graph rewiring or not) to address the bottleneck and hence alleviate the over-squashing."
INTRODUCTION,0.013458950201884253,"In this paper, we address these questions using tools from differential geometry, which traditionally
is concerned with the study of manifolds. It offers an appealing framework to study the properties
of graphs, in particular arguing that graphs, like manifolds, exhibit curvature that makes them more
suitable to be realized in spaces with hyperbolic geometry (Liu et al., 2019; Chami et al., 2019;
Boguna et al., 2021). One notion of curvature that has received attention for graph learning is Ricci
curvature (Hamilton, 1988), also known in geometry for its use in Ricci ﬂow and the subsequent
proof of the Poincaré conjecture (Perelman, 2003). Certain graph analogues of the Ricci curvature
(Forman, 2003; Ollivier, 2009; Sreejith et al., 2016) were used in Ni et al. (2018) for a discrete version
of Ricci ﬂow to construct a metric between graphs. Graph Ricci ﬂow was also used in Ni et al. (2019)
for community detection. Both of these methods use the edge weights as a substitute for the metric of
a manifold, and do not change the topological structure of the graph."
INTRODUCTION,0.014804845222072678,"Contributions and Outline.
This paper, to our knowledge, is the ﬁrst theoretical study of the
bottleneck and over-squashing phenomena in message passing neural networks from a geometric
perspective. In Section 2, we propose the Jacobian of node representations as a formal way of
measuring the over-squashing and we show that the graph topology may compromise message
propagation in graph neural networks by creating a bottleneck. In Section 3, we investigate how such
a bottleneck is induced which leads to the over-squashing of information. To this aim, we introduce a
new combinatorial edge-based curvature called Balanced Forman curvature that constitutes a sharp
lower bound to the standard Ollivier curvature on graphs, and prove that negatively curved edges are
responsible for the formation of bottlenecks (and hence for over-squashing). In Section 4, we present
a new curvature-based method for graph rewiring called Stochastic Discrete Ricci Flow. According
to the theoretical results in Section 3, this rewiring method is suited to address the graph bottleneck
and hence alleviate the over-squashing by surgically targeting the edges responsible for the issue.
By contrast, we rigorously show that a recently introduced diffusion-based rewiring scheme might
generally fail to reduce the bottleneck. Finally, in Section 5, we compare different rewiring strategies
experimentally on several standard graph learning datasets."

THE OVER-SQUASHING PROBLEM,0.03768506056527591,"Multiple recent papers observed that MPNNs tend to perform poorly in situations when the learned
task requires long-range dependencies and at the same time the structure of the graph results in
exponentially many long-range neighboring nodes. We say that a graph learning problem has
long-range dependencies when the output of a MPNN depends on representations of distant nodes
interacting with each other. If long-range dependencies are present, messages coming from non-
adjacent nodes need to be propagated across the network without being too distorted. In many cases
however (e.g. in ‘small-world’ graphs such as social networks), the size of the receptive ﬁeld Br(i)
grows exponentially with r. If this occurs, representations of exponentially many neighboring nodes
need to be compressed into ﬁxed-size vectors to propagate messages to node i, causing a phenomenon
referred to as over-squashing of information (Alon & Yahav, 2021). In line with Alon & Yahav
(2021), we refer to those structural properties of the graph that lead to over-squashing as a bottleneck1."

geodesic dispersion, i.e. whether geodesics starting at nearby points with ‘same’ velocity remain
parallel (Euclidean space), converge (spherical space), or diverge (hyperbolic space). To motivate
the introduction of a Ricci curvature for graphs, we focus on these three cases. Consider two nodes
i ∼j and two edges starting at i and j respectively. In a discrete spherical geometry (Figure 2a),
the edges would meet at k to form a triangle (complete graph). In a discrete Euclidean geometry
(Figure 2b), the edges would stay parallel and form a 4-cycle based at i ∼j (orthogonal grid). Finally,
in a discrete hyperbolic geometry (Figure 2c), the mutual distance of the edge endpoints would have
grown compared to that of i and j (tree). Therefore, a Ricci curvature for graphs should provide us
with more sophisticated tools than the degree to analyze the neighborhood of an edge."

A good way of understanding the effec-
tiveness of SDRF in reducing the graph bottleneck is through comparison with random-walk based
rewiring strategies. Recall that, as argued in Section 3, the Cheeger constant hG of a graph constitutes
a rough measure of its bottleneckedness as induced by the inter-community edges (a small hG is
indicative of a bottleneck). Suppose we are given a graph G with a small hG and wish to rewire it into
a graph G′ with a signiﬁcantly improved Cheeger constant in order to reduce the inter-community
bottleneck. A random-walk based rewiring method such as DIGL (Klicpera et al., 2019) acts by

more likely to preserve the structure of the input graph better than a random-walk based approach.
Consider, for example, that we are given ρ > 0 and wish to rewire the graph such that the new edge
set E′ is within graph-edit distance ρ from the original E. Theorem 4 tells us how to do the rewiring
under such constraints in order to best address the over-squashing: the topological modiﬁcations

thus overall statistical properties of the rewired graph such as degree distribution are likely to be
better preserved. Moreover, graph convolutional networks tend to be more stable to perturbations of

datasets with low homophily, nodes at short diffusion distance are more likely to belong to different
label classes, meaning that a diffusion-based rewiring might inject noise and hence compromise
performance as also noted in Klicpera et al. (2019). Conversely, on a low-homophily dataset, a
curvature-based approach as SDRF modiﬁes the edge set mainly around the most negatively curved
edges, meaning that it decreases the bottleneck without signiﬁcantly increasing the connectivity

from Klicpera et al. (2019) (GDC with the PPR kernel) and the +FA method from Alon & Yahav
(2021), where the last layer of the GNN is made fully connected. We evaluate the methods on
nine datasets: Cornell, Texas and Wisconsin from the WebKB dataset4; Chameleon and Squirrel
(Rozemberczki et al., 2021) along with Actor (Tang et al., 2009); and Cora (McCallum et al., 2000),
Citeseer (Sen et al., 2008) and Pubmed (Namata et al., 2012). Statistics for these datasets can be found
in Appendix F.1. Our base model is a GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017). Following Shchur et al. (2018)
and Klicpera et al. (2019) we optimized hyperparameters for all dataset-preprocessing combinations
separately by random search over 100 data splits. Results are reported as average accuracies on a
test set used once with 95% conﬁdence intervals calculated by bootstrapping. We compared the
performance on graphs with no preprocessing, making the graph undirected, +FA, DIGL, SDRF, and
the given combinations. For DIGL + Undirected we symmetrized the diffusion matrix as in Klicpera
et al. (2019), and for SDRF + Undirected we made the graph undirected before applying SDRF. For
more details on the experiments and datasets see Appendix F, and for the hyperparameters used for
each model and preprocessing see Appendix F.4."

that SDRF improves upon the baseline in all cases, and that the largest improvements are seen on the

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.18707940780619112,"In this paper, we studied the graph bottleneck and the over-squashing phenomena limiting the
performance of message passing graph neural networks from a geometric perspective. We started
with a Jacobian approach to determine how the over-squashing phenomenon is dictated by the graph
topology as in equation 2. We then investigated further how the topology induces the bottleneck
and hence causes over-squashing. We introduced a new notion of edge-based Ricci curvature called
Balanced Forman curvature, relating it to the classical Ollivier curvature (Theorem 2). We then
proved in Theorem 4 that negatively-curved edges are responsible for over-squashing, calling for a
possibility of curvature-based rewiring of the graph in order to improve its bottleneckedness. We
show one such possibility (Algorithm 1), inspired by the classical Ricci ﬂow and comment on the
advantages of surgical method such as this. We show both theoretically and experimentally that the
proposed method can be advantageous compared to a diffusion-based rewiring approach, opening the
door for curvature-based rewiring methods for improving GNN performance going forward."
CONCLUSION,0.18842530282637954,"Limitations and future directions.
Our paper establishes a geometric perspective on the graph
bottleneck and over-squashing, providing new tools to study and cope with these phenomena. One
limitation of our work is that the theoretical results presented here do not currently extend to multi-
graphs. In addition, the current methodology is agnostic to information beyond the graph topology,
such as node features. In future works, we will develop a notion of the curvature and the corresponding
rewiring method that can take into account such information."

C,0.765814266487214,"Betweenness centrality to measure bottleneck.
In equation 2 we have derived how the topology
of the graph affects the dependence of the hidden node representation h(r+1)
i
on the input feature xs,
for nodes i, s at distance r + 1. We note that in this case ˆAr+1
is
is exactly measuring the number of
minimal paths from i to s. If the receptive ﬁeld Br+1(i) is a binary tree, then we have seen that the
entry of the power matrix decays exponentially. The reason for such decay stems from the existence
of exponentially many nodes in the receptive ﬁeld combined with the lack of multiple minimal paths
(shortcuts). When such conditions hold, most of the minimal paths go through the same nodes,
which is exactly what happens for the tree where each node is in the minimal paths between different
branches. Since the frequency in which a node appears in the minimal path of distinct pairs of nodes
is measured by the betweenness centrality Freeman (1977), we propose a topological characterization
of the ‘bottleneckedness’ of a graph as follows:
Deﬁnition 9 (bottleneck). The bottleneck-value of G is bG := 1"
C,0.7671601615074024,"n
Pn
i=1 b(i), where b(i) denotes the

C,0.7685060565275909,"From a standard combinatorial argument it follows that if G is connected, then"

C,0.7711978465679677,"i,j
(dG(i, j) −1) .
(17)"
C,0.7725437415881561,"We note that bG = 0 iff G is the complete graph Kn. Therefore, bG determines how far the given
topology is from Kn, with the latter representing the limit case of a fully connected layer Alon &
Yahav (2021) where no bottleneck may occur as any pair of nodes would be neighbours. This further
supports our intuition that the betweenness centrality is a good topological candidate for providing a
global measurement of bottleneckedness in the graph."
C,0.7738896366083445,"It also follows from equation 17 that any update to the graph topology consisting of edge additions
would decrease bG and thus reduce the bottleneck. The quantity bG is global in nature though and
hence lacks robustness. As a pedagogical example, consider a barbell G(m, 2r + 1), with m the size
of the two cliques joined by a path of length 2r + 1 and focus on the edge i ∼j in the middle of
such path. Nodes i and j are central to the graph, in the sense that most minimal paths go through
them and indeed their betweenness centrality is b(i) = b(j) = (m + r)2 + (m + r). If now we add a"
C,0.775235531628533,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
C,0.7765814266487214,"single edge joining the two cliques Km, the values b(i) and b(j) decrease dramatically by Ω(m2 + r).
Since the operation is non-local, we see that the representation h(ℓ)
i
of any MPNN is unaffected by
the edge addition for any ℓ∈(0, r), and similarly for j. Eventually, if we keep adding edges, the
receptive ﬁelds Bs(i) will be affected for small values of s as well: the drawback of such approach
is that the resulting adjacency may be signiﬁcantly different. Conversely, the curvature provides a
more precise, local and hence robust way of controlling the bottleneck and hence the over-squashing
problem. Nonetheless, we relate the betweenness centrality to the Jacobian of the hidden features.

EXPERIMENTS"
C,0.892328398384926,"Our experiments in this paper are semi-supervised node classiﬁcation (semi-supervised in that the
graph structure provides some unlabelled information) on nine common graph learning datasets.
Cornell, Texas and Wisconsin are small heterophilic datasets based on webpage networks from
the WebKB dataset. Chameleon and Squirrel (Rozemberczki et al., 2021) are medium heterophilic
datasets based on Wikipedia networks, along with Actor, the actor-only induced subgraph of the ﬁlm-
director-actor-writer network (Tang et al., 2009). Cora (McCallum et al., 2000), Citeseer (Sen et al.,
2008) and Pubmed (Namata et al., 2012) are medium homophilic datasets based on citation networks.
As in Klicpera et al. (2019), for all experiments we consider the largest connected component of the
graph."
C,0.8936742934051144,"When splitting the data into train/validation/test sets, we ﬁrst separate the data into a development set
and the test set. This is done once to ensure the test set is not used for any training or hyperparameter
ﬁtting before the ﬁnal evaluation. For each of the 100 random splits the development set is divided
randomly into a train set and a validation set, where we train models on the train set and evaluate
on the validation set. We ﬁt hyperparameters by random search, maximising the mean accuracy
across the validation sets. The accuracy then reported in Table 2 is the mean accuracy on the test set
from models trained on the train sets with the chosen hyperparameters, along with a 95% conﬁdence
interval calculated by bootstrapping the test set accuracies with 1000 samples. For Cora, Citeseer
and Pubmed the development set contains 1500 nodes with the rest kept for the test set, and for each
random split the train set is chosen to contain 20 nodes of each class while the rest form the validation
set. As this is the same method as Klicpera et al. (2019) and we use the same random seeds, we
are using the same test set and expect to have comparable results. For the remaining datasets we
perform a 60/20/20 split, with 20% of nodes set aside as the test set and then for each random split
the remaining 80% is split into 60% training, 20% validation."
