ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0013315579227696406,"Machine learning training methods depend plentifully and intricately on hyperpa-
rameters, motivating automated strategies for their optimisation. Many existing
algorithms restart training for each new hyperparameter choice, at considerable
computational cost. Some hypergradient-based one-pass methods exist, but these
either cannot be applied to arbitrary optimiser hyperparameters (such as learning
rates and momenta) or take several times longer to train than their base models.
We extend these existing methods to develop an approximate hypergradient-based
hyperparameter optimiser which is applicable to any continuous hyperparameter
appearing in a differentiable model weight update, yet requires only one training
episode, with no restarts. We also provide a motivating argument for convergence
to the true hypergradient, and perform tractable gradient-based optimisation of
independent learning rates for each model parameter. Our method performs compet-
itively from varied random hyperparameter initialisations on several UCI datasets
and Fashion-MNIST (using a one-layer MLP), Penn Treebank (using an LSTM)
and CIFAR-10 (using a ResNet-18), in time only 2–3x greater than vanilla training."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.0039946737683089215,"Many machine learning methods are governed by hyperparameters: quantities other than model
parameters or weights which nonetheless inﬂuence training (e.g. optimiser settings, dropout probabili-
ties and dataset conﬁgurations). As suitable hyperparameter selection is crucial to system performance
(e.g. Kohavi & John (1995)), it is a pillar of efforts to automate machine learning (Hutter et al., 2018,
Chapter 1), spawning several hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) algorithms (e.g. Bergstra & Bengio
(2012); Snoek et al. (2012; 2015); Falkner et al. (2018)). However, HPO is computationally intensive
and random search is an unexpectedly strong (but beatable; Turner et al. (2021)) baseline; beyond
random or grid searches, HPO is relatively underused in research (Bouthillier & Varoquaux, 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.005326231691078562,"Recently, Lorraine et al. (2020) used gradient-based updates to adjust hyperparameters during training,
displaying impressive optimisation performance and scalability to high-dimensional hyperparameters.
Despite their computational efﬁciency (since updates occur before ﬁnal training performance is
known), Lorraine et al.’s algorithm only applies to hyperparameters on which the loss function
depends explicitly (such as ℓ2 regularisation), notably excluding optimiser hyperparameters."
INTRODUCTION,0.006657789613848202,"Our work extends Lorraine et al.’s algorithm to support arbitrary continuous inputs to a differentiable
weight update formula, including learning rates and momentum factors. We demonstrate our algo-
rithm handles a range of hyperparameter initialisations and datasets, improving test loss after a single
training episode (‘one pass’). Relaxing differentiation-through-optimisation (Domke, 2012) and
hypergradient descent’s (Baydin et al., 2018) exactness allows us to improve computational and mem-
ory efﬁciency. Our scalable one-pass method improves performance from arbitrary hyperparameter
initialisations, and could be augmented with a further search over those initialisations if desired."

Conventionally, our visualisation of gradient descent has the learning rate control the size of steps
over some undulating landscape. Instead, we propose ﬁxing a unit step size, with the ‘learning
rate’ scaling the landscape underneath. Similarly, we suppose a ‘momentum’ could, at every point,
locally squash the loss surface in the negative-gradient direction and stretch it in the positive-gradient
direction. In aggregate, these transformations straighten out optimisation trajectories and bring local
optima closer to the current point. While more complex hyperparameters lack a clear visualisation in
this framework, it nevertheless allows a broader class of hyperparameters to ‘directly alter the loss
function’ instead of remaining completely independent, circumventing the problem with optimiser
hyperparameters noted by Lorraine et al. (2020). Figure 2 and Appendix A.3 support this argument."

earlier work on gradient computation (Franceschi et al., 2017), but do not immediately accommodate
other hyperparameters. While non-smooth procedures exist (Lopez-Ramos & Beferull-Lozano,
2021), most methods focus on smooth hyperparameters which augment the loss function (e.g. weight
regularisation) and work with the augmented loss directly. Consequently, they cannot handle optimiser
hyperparameters not represented in the loss function (e.g. learning rates and momentum factors;

β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999. While these meta-hyperparameters are not tuned, previous work indicates
performance is progressively less sensitive to higher-order hyperparameters (Franceschi et al., 2017;
2018; Majumder et al., 2019). As some settings habitually chose unstable high learning rates, we clip
these to [10−10, 1] throughout."

UCI AND KIN8NM DATASETS: ESTABLISHING ROBUSTNESS"
EXPERIMENTS,0.17709720372836218,"Next, we consider the same 50-hidden-unit MLP applied to seven standard UCI datasets (Boston
Housing, Concrete, Energy, Naval, Power, Wine, Yacht) and Kin8nm, in a fashion analogous to
Gal & Ghahramani (2016) (we do not consider dropout or Bayesian formulations). We train 200
hyperparameter initialisations for 4 000 full-batch epochs. Table 1 shows results for three datasets,
with complete loss evolution and distribution plots in Appendix B.4. Some extreme hyperparameters
caused numerical instability and NaN ﬁnal losses, which our averages ignore. NaN results are not
problematic: they indicate extremely poor initialisations, which should be easier for the user to rectify
than merely mediocre hyperparameters. Error bars are based on 1 000 sets of bootstrap samples."
EXPERIMENTS,0.17842876165113183,"Given the sparse distribution of strong hyperparameter initialitions, random sampling unsurprisingly
achieves generally poor averages. Random (× LR) applies a learning rate multiplier, uniformly
chosen in [0.95, 1.01]; these limits allow extreme initial learning rates to revert to more typical values
after 400 multiplications. This setting’s poor performance shows naïve learning rate schedules cannot
match our algorithms’ average improvements. A stronger baseline is Random (3-batched), which
harshly simulates the greater computational cost of our methods by retaining only the best of every
three Random trials (according to validation loss). This setting comes close to, but cannot robustly
beat, our methods — a claim reinforced by ﬁnal test loss distributions (Figure 9, Appendix B.4)."
EXPERIMENTS,0.17976031957390146,"Lorraine et al. (2020)’s algorithm is surprisingly indistinguishable from Random in our trials, though
it must account for three random hyperparameters while varying only one (the weight decay). We
surmise that learning rates and momenta are more important hyperparameters to select, and poor
choices cannot be overcome by intelligent use of weight decay. Baydin et al. (2018)’s algorithm,
however, comes closer to the performance of Random (3-batched), indicating more successful
intervention in its sole optimisable hyperparameter (learning rate). Variance is also much lower than
the preceding algorithms, suggesting greater stability. That said, despite concentrating on a more
important hyperparameter, Baydin still suffers from being unable to control every hyperparameter."
EXPERIMENTS,0.1810918774966711,"Our scalar algorithms (OursWD+LR and OursWD+LR+M) appear generally more robust to these initiali-
sations, with average losses beating Random, Lorraine and Baydin. Figures 8 and 9 (Appendix B.4)
clearly distinguish these algorithms from the preceding: we achieve performant results over a wider
space of initial hyperparameters. Given it considers more hyperparameters, OursWD+LR+M predictably
outperforms OursWD+LR, although the difference is less prominent in certain datasets. Unlike pure
HPO, the non-Random algorithms in Table 1 vary hyperparameters during training, combining aspects
of HPO and schedule learning. They are thus more ﬂexible than conventional, static-hyperparameter
techniques, even in high dimensions (Lorraine et al., 2020)."
EXPERIMENTS,0.18242343541944075,"Diff-through-Opt exactly differentiates the current loss with respect to the hyperparameters, over the
same i = 5 look-back window and T = 10 update interval. As an exact version of OursWD+LR+M
(though subject to the same short-horizon bias), it unsurprisingly matches the other algorithms
(Figures 8 and 9, Appendix B.4). However, our scalar methods’ proximity to this exact baseline is
reassuring given our much-reduced memory requirements and generally comparable error bars. In
these experiments, lengthening Diff-through-Opt’s look-back horizon to all 4 000 training steps, and
repeating those steps for 30 hyperparameter updates, did not improve its performance (Appendix B.7)."

EXPERIMENTS,0.18508655126498003,"OursWD+HDLR+M theoretically mitigates short-horizon bias (Wu et al., 2018) by adapting appropriately
to high- and low-curvature directions. While this substantially improves performance on some
datasets, it is outperformed by scalar methods on others (Figures 8 and 9, Appendix B.4). We also
see slightly reduced stability, with more trials diverging to NaN ﬁnal losses. Intuitively, the risk of
overﬁtting to the validation set is expected to increase as we introduce more hyperparameters, which
could explain this behaviour — committing to large learning rates in a few selected directions, as this
method often does, may prove harmful if the loss surface dynamics change suddenly. However, we
leave detailed investigation of the high-dimensional dynamics to future work."

LARGE-SCALE DATASETS: PRACTICAL SCALABILITY"
EXPERIMENTS,0.1877496671105193,"Fashion-MNIST: HPO in Multi-Layer Perceptrons
We train the same single 50-unit hidden
layer MLP on 10 epochs of Fashion-MNIST (Xiao et al., 2017), using 50-sample batches. Table 2
and Figure 12a (Appendix B.6) show average test set cross-entropies over 100 initialisations. Clearly-
outlying ﬁnal losses (above 103) are set to NaN to stop them dominating our error bars."
EXPERIMENTS,0.18908122503328895,"Echoing Section 4.1, for arbitrary hyperparameter initialisations, our methods generally converge
more robustly to lower losses, even when (as in Figure 12a, Appendix B.6) NaN solutions are included
in our statistics. Importantly, we see mini-batches provide sufﬁcient gradient information for our HPO
task. Diff-through-Opt’s failure to beat our methods is surprising; we suppose noisy approximate
gradients may regularise our algorithms, preventing them from seeking the short-horizon optimum so
directly, thus mitigating short-horizon bias (see our sensitivity study in Section 4.3). Diff-through-Opt
with long look-back horizons does not improve performance for equal computation (Appendix B.7).
Finally, median and best loss evolution plots are shown in Figures 5b and 5c, the latter including
results for a Bayesian Optimisation baseline. For more details, see Appendices B.5 and B.6."
EXPERIMENTS,0.1904127829560586,"Penn Treebank: HPO in Recurrent Networks
Now, we draw inspiration from Lorraine et al.
(2020)’s large-scale trials: a 2-layer, 650-unit LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) with
learnable embedding, trained on the standard Penn Treebank-3-subset benchmark dataset (Marcus
et al., 1999) for 72 epochs. To focus our study, we omit the dropout, activation regularisation and
predeﬁned learning rate schedules used by Lorraine et al., though we retain training gradient clipping
to a Euclidean norm of 0.25. Training considers length-70 subsequences of 40 parallel sequences,
using 50 random hyperparameter initialisations."
EXPERIMENTS,0.19174434087882822,"Table 2 and Figure 12b (Appendix B.6) show ﬁnal test perplexities. They reﬂect our intuition that
adjusting progressively more hyperparameters reduces average test losses, continuing the trend
we have seen thus far. Highly bimodal ﬁnal loss distributions for some algorithms cause wide
bootstrap-sampled error bars. Learning rate adjustments show particular gains: Our algorithms and
Diff-through-Opt perform particularly well in less-optimal conﬁgurations."
EXPERIMENTS,0.19307589880159787,"CIFAR-10: HPO in Convolutional Networks
Finally, to demonstrate scalability, we train a
ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016) on CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) for 72 epochs. We use the unaugmented
dataset (since unbiased data augmentation over both training and validation datasets exhausts our
GPU memory) and optimise hyperparameters as before, using 100-image batches."
EXPERIMENTS,0.19440745672436752,"Table 2 and Figure 12c (Appendix B.6) show our results. Our gains are now more marginal, with this

MISCELLANEOUS STUDIES,0.22636484687083888,"Experiment Runtimes
For our larger-scale experiments, we illustrate comparative runtimes in
Figure 14 (Appendix B.6.1, where they are discussed in detail). Note from our Fashion-MNIST
sample (Figure 5a) that all HPO algorithms have a lower computational cost than naïvely training
two typical ﬁxed hyperparameter initialisations, despite achieving substantial HPO effect. This
compares extremely favourably to HPO methods relying on repeated retraining. Additional experi-
ments in Appendix B.8.2 combine OursWD+LR+M with Asynchronous Hyperband (Li et al., 2020b)
or Population-Based Training (Jaderberg et al., 2017), showing improved and unchanged perfor-
mance/time trade-offs, respectively."
MISCELLANEOUS STUDIES,0.22769640479360853,"UCI Energy: Sensitivity Study
Finally, we consider a range of update intervals T and look-back
distances i on UCI Energy, performing 400 hyperparameter updates from 100 random initialisations
on each, using OursWD+LR+M. We plot the median ﬁnal test losses for each choice of T and i to the
right of Figure 4, and also the median performance with no HPO (Random), which we outperform
in every case. Performance generally improves with larger T — likely because the total number
of weight updates increases with T, since the number of hyperparameter updates is ﬁxed at 400.
While increasing i gives more terms in our approximating series (6), these extra terms become more
and more biased: they are evaluated at the current weight values instead of at the progressively
more different past weight values. We theorise this trade-off explains the more complex relationship
between i and ﬁnal performance. More details are given in Appendix B.2."

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.2303595206391478,"We have presented an algorithm for optimising continuous hyperparameters, speciﬁcally those
appearing in a differentiable weight update, including optimiser hyperparameters. Our method
requires only a single training pass, has a motivating true-hypergradient convergence argument, and
demonstrates practical beneﬁts at a range of experimental scales without greatly sacriﬁcing training
time. We also tackle traditionally-intractable per-parameter learning rate optimisation on non-trivial
datasets. However, this setting surprisingly underperformed its scalar counterpart; further work is
necessary to understand this result."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.23169107856191745,"As future work, our myopic approach could be extended to longer horizons by incorporating the
principles of recent work by Micaelli & Storkey (2020), which presents a promising research
direction. We also depend inconveniently on meta-hyperparameters, which are not substantially
tuned. Ultimately, we desire systems which are completely independent of human conﬁguration, thus
motivating investigations into the removal of these settings."

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.23435419440745672,SOCIETAL IMPACT / ETHICS STATEMENT
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.23568575233022637,"Our work ﬁts into the broad subﬁeld of automatic machine learning (AutoML), which aims to use
automation to strip away the tedious work that is necessary to implement practical ML systems.
Our method focuses on automating the oft-labelled ‘black art’ of optimising hyperparameters. This
contributes towards the democratisation of ML techniques, which we hope will improve accessibility
to non-experts."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.237017310252996,"However, our method also has some associated risks. For one, developers of unethical machine
learning applications (e.g. for mass surveillance, identity theft or automated weaponry) may use
our techniques to improve their systems’ performance. The heavily metric-dominated nature of our
ﬁeld creates additional concerns — for instance, end-users of our method may not appreciate that
optimising naïvely for training and validation loss alone may result in dangerously poorly-trained or
unethical models if the chosen metric, developer’s intentions and moral good do not align."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.23834886817576564,"More broadly, users may rely excessively on HPO techniques to optimise their models’ performance,
which can lead to poor results and inaccurate comparisons if the HPO strategy is imperfect. Further,
reducing the need to consider hyperparmeter tuning abstracts away an important component of how
machine learning methods work in practice. Knowledge of this component may then become less
accessible, inhibiting understanding and future research insights from the wider community."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.2396804260985353,"Our datasets are drawn from standard benchmarks, and thus should not introduce new societal
risks. Similarly, our work aims to decrease the computational burden of HPO, which should miti-
gate the environmental impact of ML training — an ever more important goal in our increasingly
environmentally-conscious society."

with respect to these hyperparameters thus cannot provide any useful information for computing
their gradient-based updates. Similarly, the Implicit Function Theorem cannot be applied to motivate
their approximation in this case, since LT is not an implicit function of these hyperparameters.
Consequently, Lorraine et al. declare their method is methodologically restricted to operate on

traverse only by taking steps of precisely the magnitude of the local gradient. Now, when we optimise
η, we are rescaling the surface beneath our update step, and consequently also rescaling the update
step size. In this way, we have coupled η and LT into one objective L, which varies with η and so
adheres to the methodological restrictions noted by Lorraine et al.. The key idea is thus that we have
reinterpreted the problem to allow optimiser hyperparameters to dynamically transform the objective
surface, which legitimises our derivation."

is not an immediately obvoius closed form for L. Suppose we are descending a steep-sided valley
of the original loss surface LT . The momentum acts to ‘pull’ the update step in the direction it has
accumulated in its buffer (down the axis of the valley), so it acts to augment gradients in the valley’s
downhill direction, and diminishes the effect of gradients in other directions."
REFERENCES,0.38748335552596536,"If we are working with the pseudo-loss L, we need to achieve the same effect, but we do not have
direct control over the update step size, which is determined by the local gradient of L. So if the
update step is aligned with the accumulated momentum, we must ‘squash’ the loss surface about
our current point in this direction, such that our ﬁxed update step lands at a point further down the
valley in the original, unscaled space of LT . Accordingly, if the update step is misaligned with the
accumulated momentum, this squashing in the direction of the momentum buffer must be combined
with a ‘stretching’ in the update step direction, so that we make less progress in that direction of the
original space. In aggregate, this is a complex and intricate transformation of the space, such that we
bring the ‘correct’ new point (as speciﬁed by the optimiser) to lie underneath the update step given by
−∂L ∂w."

UCI ENERGY: PROOF OF CONCEPT"
REFERENCES,0.40878828229027964,"Our proof of concept graphic (Figure 3) is constructed using the same experimental conﬁguration
as Section 4.1. Training 500 random initialisations of the model, weight decay and learning rate
for 4 000 network weight update steps on Random (without any HPO) yields source data for the
heatmap forming the background of Figure 3. The heatmap itself is the predictive mean of a Gaussian
process (Williams & Rasmussen, 1996) using the sum of an RBF and white noise kernel. We ﬁt the
Gaussian process in log (input and output) space using the defaults of the Scikit-learn implementation
(Pedregosa et al., 2011), which automatically select hyperparameters for the kernels. Any NaN data
points are replaced with a large ﬁnal test loss (150) for the purpose of computing this regression. We
then train a small number of additional initialisations using OursWD+LR and plot these trajectories. As
always, the training set provides network weight updates, the validation set provides hyperparameter
updates and our results plot ﬁnal performance on the test set. While we do not expect the optimal
trajectory during training to coincide with gradients of our background heatmap, the latter provides
useful context."
REFERENCES,0.41011984021304926,"Generally, given our limited training budget, larger learning rates improve ﬁnal performance up to
a point, then cause instability if taken to extremes, and the movement of our trajectories reﬂects
this. Many trajectories select large weight decay coefﬁcients before doubling back on themselves to
smaller weight decays — suggestive of our algorithm using the weight decay to avoid converging to
speciﬁc minima. Trajectories generally converge to the valley of good test performance at a learning
rate of around 10−1 and weight decay below 10−2, further demonstrating appropriate behaviour. In
short, we are able to make sensible and interpretable updates to the hyperparameters of this problem,
which lends support to the applicability of our method."

REFERENCES,0.440745672436751,"Figure 6 shows our ﬁnal performance results in this setting: our algorithm’s strongest conﬁgurations
(Figure 6b) compare favourably with results obtained using the exact hypergradients of Diff-through-
Opt (Figure 6c). Noting that the conditions necessary to guarantee our algorithm’s convergence to
the best-response derivative (speciﬁcally that the current network weights are optimal for the current
hyperparameters) are almost certainly not met in practice, it is unsurprising that Diff-through-Opt
achieves greater performance. This difference is much smaller, however, than that between both HPO
algorithms and the Random base case; given our substantial efﬁciency beneﬁts over Diff-through-Opt,
we make an acceptable compromise between accuracy and scalability. Further, these results justify
our choice of T = 10 and i = 5 to match the setting of Lorraine et al. (2020). That said, recall these
ﬁgures enforce consistency of number of hyperparameter updates, not of total computational expense;
there remains a case for using large numbers of less precise hyperparameter updates (small T and i),
which may promote faster convergence in practice."
REFERENCES,0.4420772303595206,"Our results illustrate the trade-off in selecting a look-back distance i. In principle, increasing i
includes more terms in our Neumann series approximation to the best-response derivative (6), which
should result in closer convergence to the true derivative. But our derivation of this expression replaces
the sequence w0, w1, · · · , wi−1 from (5) with wi at all time steps. Because the jth summation step
of (5) involves a product of terms in wi−1 back to wi−1−j, the approximation of each summation
step in (6) becomes less and less accurate as j increases, since we expect earlier model weights to
become more different from wi. A larger i causes us to continue the summation up to larger j, so
introduces progressively less accurate terms into our approximations. Thus, increasing i is only of
value while this inaccuracy is counteracted by the improved convergence of our summation, giving
the behaviour we see here."

numerical computational error than the generally larger learning rates, in which case hypergradients

REFERENCES,0.4833555259653795,"Throughout, we seek robustness to a range of different initialisations, which is indicated by average
ﬁnal performance across a variety of initial hyperparameter choices. We include metrics of best
performance to show each algorithm is capable of reaching the same vicinity as the best possible case,
but this is not the focus of our work. Intuitively, a more naïve algorithm (e.g. Random) could stumble
across the best possible ﬁnal model weights, in which case no other algorithm would be able to beat
it; this would not necessarily mean we would prefer the Random algorithm in a general setting."

UCI AND KIN8NM DATASETS"
REFERENCES,0.48601864181091875,"Results from all UCI datasets we considered and Kin8nm are presented in Figures 8 and 9. These
show many of the features already discussed in Section 4.1. We account for experimental runs ending
in NaN losses by appropriately scaling the maximum value of the CDFs in Figure 9 to be less than
1.0. For each dataset, one random conﬁguration is selected, and the resulting learning rate evolutions
plotted in Figure 10. Note that UCI Naval generated a large number of NaN runs, which explains the
prominent failure of certain algorithms to reach the top of our CDF plots."

of 30-sample Bayesian Optimisation (BO) on selected UCI datasets, Kin8nm and Fashion-MNIST,
using the same procedure as Random to train each sampled conﬁguration (but now with an separate
validation set used to compare conﬁgurations), and record these in Tables 6 and 7. We use the Python
BO implementation of Nogueira (2014), retaining the default conﬁguration that the ﬁrst ﬁve of our
30 initialisations be drawn randomly from the space. All runtimes are measured based on 8-way
parallel execution per GPU. Although BO involves a much greater computational burden than the
other methods we consider, it should more robustly estimate the optimal hyperparameters."

the Random and Lorraine baselines, and similarly as close as Diff-through-Opt. On Fashion-MNIST
especially, our methods are very competitive, achieving performance in the vicinity of BO with 30
times less computation. Considering our best runs, we seem to suffer only a minor performance
penalty (compared to the best hyperparameters we found) by adopting Algorithm 1."
REFERENCES,0.6178428761651131,"As an additional comparison, we show in Figure 11 the evolution of incumbent best test loss over wall
time during our previous training of 200 (UCI and Kin8nm)/100 (Fashion-MNIST) initialisations.
Clearly we would expect BO’s greater computation to result in smaller ﬁnal losses, which we observe,
but our methods are capable of reaching performant results much faster than BO. This underscores the
principal beneﬁt of our algorithm: with only a single training episode and a relatively small runtime
penalty, we achieve a meaningful HPO effect, which reaches the vicinity of the ideal performance
found by much slower and more computationally onerous methods."

second derivatives with respect to each model weight, which appears more prominently in our
Penn Treebank and CIFAR-10 experiments. However, our extension of Lorraine et al. (2020)’s
method to additional hyperparameters doesn’t dramatically increase runtimes: second derivative
computations themselves are responsible for most added complexity. In all three cases, our scalar
algorithms have runtimes within that of naïvely training two ﬁxed hyperparameter initialisations
(such as those considered by Random), comparing extremely favourably to HPO methods requiring
repeated retraining. Naturally, the massive increase in the number of hyperparameters optimised
by OursWD+HDLR+M causes a prominent jump in runtimes, but even this algorithm remains within a
practical factor of the Random baseline."

this, performing 30 (UCI and Kin8nm) / 50 (Fashion-MNIST) hyperparameter updates using the
maximum look-back horizon and restarting training with the new hyperparameters after each update.
In this sense, we use 30 or 50 times as much computation as in our other algorithms (here: Random,
OursWD+LR+M and Diff-through-Opt). The latter update their hyperparameters at the same intervals as
before, giving 20 (UCI and Kin8nm) / 100 (Fashion-MNIST) updates overall. We take 60 random
hyperparameter initialisations and run each of these four methods on them."

datasets — on UCI and Kin8nm trials, Long Diff-through-Opt manages, as expected, to achieve
substantially improved ﬁnal performance over its short-horizon competition, but on Fashion-MNIST,
performance is much more similar between HPO algorithms. Wu et al. (2018) intuit short-horizon
bias by describing the simple setting of a quadratic with different curvature magnitudes in each
dimension, and we expect the simpler UCI/Kin8nm datasets to match this clean depiction of the
optimisation space more closely than Fashion-MNIST. Thus, we speculate the space of non-trivial
datasets, such as Fashion-MNIST, is sufﬁciently complicated that merely eliminating short-horizon
bias is insufﬁcient to prevent the optimiser from getting stuck in similarly-performant local optima."

setting here, Full Diff-through-Opt, extends the Diff-through-Opt conﬁguration from Section 4 by
using a full look-back horizon of 4 000 steps, restarting training after each hyperparameter update and
performing 30 such updates. This permits a full-horizon study on the same problem as before, using
a similar computational footprint to our Bayesian Optimisation trials of Appendix B.5 (that is, 30
times the cost of our original experiments). We consider 36 random initialisations for this algorithm,

with its short-horizon counterparts, achieving much higher average ﬁnal losses (the larger variance
being, of course, expected due to the smaller number of repetitions). The principal difference between
Full Diff-through-Opt and Diff-through-Opt, apart from the different look-back distances, is the
number of hyperparameter updates performed, since these are far more expensive in the former case.
While more hyperparameter updates would likely cause Full Diff-through-Opt’s performance to
improve, the computational impact would be massive, with such a setting unlikely to be desired in
practical applications. Again, we conclude that it is simplistic to claim short-horizon bias renders
an algorithm ill-suited to HPO — in reality, it is one of many factors worthy of consideration in
the selection of an approach. In this case, the larger number of updates we are able to perform
by sacriﬁcing horizon length leads to favourable performance improvements, even though this
optimisation is technically ‘biased’ as a result."

ASYNCHRONOUS HYPERBAND AND POPULATION-BASED TRAINING"
REFERENCES,0.8721704394141145,"Finally, we consider two further non-gradient-based HPO strategies: Asynchronous Hyperband
(ASHA; Li et al. (2020b)) and Population-Based Training (PBT; Jaderberg et al. (2017)). Both
approaches exploit parallel computation to consider a population of hyperparameter selections, and
the performance of each individual selection during training is used to focus computational effort on
the most promising trials. Broadly speaking, ASHA does this by terminating poorly-performing trials
early, while PBT locally perturbs trials or replaces them entirely with better-performing checkpoints.
In this sense, ASHA and PBT are orthogonal to the type of algorithm we propose in this paper, which
seeks to improve the performance obtained by single initialisations trained in isolation. However, our
algorithm can readily be combined with ASHA or PBT: by training each proposed hyperparameter
choice using our algorithm instead of ﬁxing the hyperparameters as is conventional, we exploit our
method’s beneﬁts for each individual run, thus providing ASHA/PBT with a stronger population of"

this section."
REFERENCES,0.8761651131824234,"Throughout, we make use of the Ray Tune (Liaw et al., 2018) library’s implementation of these
strategies, utilising the default settings unless noted, and consider the UCI Energy dataset using the
same setup as in Section 4.1. For the Random setting, we do not combine the training and validation
datasets, instead training with the former and reserving the latter for the evaluation of different
initialisations by ASHA/PBT. For OurWD+LR+M setting, the validation set is used both for gradient-
based hyperparameter updates during training and for conﬁguration evaluation by ASHA/PBT.
Otherwise, both settings are the same as in Section 4, and again we quote ﬁnal losses on a held-out
test set, with 1 000 full-dataset bootstrap samples used to compute standard errors. We also leave the
hyperparameter search space unchanged from before (see Section B.3)."
REFERENCES,0.877496671105193,"Asynchronous Hyperband
For ASHA, we seek to match the 4 000 × 200 weight update steps
performed in Section 4.1, with 4 000 steps still required for full training. Under the default settings

of (1, 4, 16, 64, 256, 1 024, 4 000) iterations, with the number of initialisations surviving to each
budget step correspondingly decreasing by a factor of 4 each time. Non-parallelised Hyperband (Li

eight workers in parallel to mimic the experimental setting of our earlier studies."
REFERENCES,0.8801597869507324,"From the results in Table 15, we see our hypothesis largely conﬁrmed. By virtue of curating
the population of initialisations, rather than considering each one in isolation, ASHA trivially
gives improved average performance over all earlier methods. However, combining ASHA with
OursWD+LR+M yields a signiﬁcantly more performant population of trials on average, which leads
to low-valued, low-variance mean and median ﬁnal test performance. In both ASHA settings, the
best ﬁnal losses in the resulting populations are towards the lower end of those found in our previous
results, but do not beat the especially small loss found by Random (3-batched). From this, we suppose
that the methods we consider are nearing the performance limits of the UCI Energy dataset on this
model when trained in this way. But regardless, we clearly see that deploying our algorithm in a
particular context tends to improve average-case performance, indicating a positive inﬂuence on
training."
REFERENCES,0.881491344873502,"Population-Based Training
For PBT, we again attempt to match the earlier computational burden
by training 200 initialisations for 4 000 iterations using 8-way parallelism, acknowledging that PBT’s
checkpoint restoration will cause most runs to perform more than 4 000 weight update steps. We set
the perturbation interval to 100 steps, so each initialisation has 40 opportunities to be mutated or reset
by PBT. In PBT + OursWD+LR+M, it is unclear how to accommodate PBT’s hyperparameter mutations,
as our algorithm will have updated the hyperparameters PBT associates with each trial. Where we
detect PBT has mutated the hyperparameters, we compute the ratio between the new and old values
as seen by PBT, then apply that same ratio to mutate the true current value of the hyperparameters."
REFERENCES,0.8828229027962716,"Our PBT results (Table 15) largely continue the pattern we have discussed. Combining our algorithm
with PBT achieves substantial improvements in mean and median performance, giving the lowest
values seen in any of our experiments on UCI Energy. PBT uses additional internal machinery
to manage the population of hyperparameter initialisations, and we found this caused the total
training time to considerably increase over the non-population-based methods of Section 4.1, so
the performance improvements we see here are perhaps unsurprising (see also Figure 19 and our
discussion of runtimes below). However, in situations where we have already committed to the
additional cost of PBT, replacing the ﬁxed-hyperparameter internal training routine with our algorithm
clearly results in a superior population of models, improving the quality of the models available
for downstream applications. Note that the quality of the search over hyperparameter initialisations
affects our overall best loss found, so some variation in the Best column of Table 15 is to be expected."

this is likely because the overhead of saving checkpoints and restarting from them dominated the
overall cost of running PBT. In both cases, PBT is substantially slower than ASHA to reach the most
performant losses. Note by comparison with Figure 11a that our methods alone are competitive with
ASHA when we compare the evolution of incumbent best performance over time. Note also that
ASHA and PBT do not have access to the intermediate test losses plotted in Figure 19, so the smallest
test losses found are not necessarily achievable as an output of these methods."

cannot optimise optimiser hyperparameters such as learning rates and momentum factors, since these
come into play only after the training loss has been computed and differentiated. While a careful
choice of transformed loss function may allow certain optimiser hyperparameters to be handled by
the framework of Lorraine et al. (2020) (e.g. setting L = ηLT to incorporate a learning rate), this
manual rederivation is far from trivial in more complex cases (e.g. to incorporate momentum)."

hyperparameters of most gradient-based optimisers, including SGD. Thus, we lift Lorraine et al.’s
