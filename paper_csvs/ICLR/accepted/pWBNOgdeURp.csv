ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.005747126436781609,"The discovery of sparse subnetworks that are able to perform as well as full mod-
els has found broad applied and theoretical interest. While many pruning methods
have been developed to this end, the na¨ıve approach of removing parameters based
on their magnitude has been found to be as robust as more complex, state-of-the-
art algorithms. The lack of theory behind magnitude pruning’s success, especially
pre-convergence, and its relation to other pruning methods, such as gradient based
pruning, are outstanding open questions in the ﬁeld that are in need of being ad-
dressed. We make use of recent advances in dynamical systems theory, namely
Koopman operator theory, to deﬁne a new class of theoretically motivated prun-
ing algorithms. We show that these algorithms can be equivalent to magnitude
and gradient based pruning, unifying these seemingly disparate methods, and ﬁnd
that they can be used to shed light on magnitude pruning’s performance during the
early part of training."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.017241379310344827,"A surprising, but well-replicated, result in the study of deep neural network (DNN) optimization is
that it is often possible to signiﬁcantly “prune” the number of parameters after training with little
effect on performance (Janowsky, 1989; Mozer & Smolensky, 1989a;b; LeCun et al., 1989; Karnin,
1990; Han et al., 2015; Blalock et al., 2020). Because DNNs have become increasingly large and
require considerable storage, memory bandwidth, and computational resources (Han et al., 2015),
ﬁnding a reduced form is desirable and has become an area of major research. In addition to the
practical considerations, DNN pruning has become of theoretical interest, as the search for subnet-
works that can be pruned with minimal effect on performance led to new insight on the success of
large DNNs, via the development of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) (Frankle & Carbin, 2019;
Frankle et al., 2020). A considerable body of literature has been devoted to expanding, interrogating,
and critiquing the LTH, furthering the understanding of sparse DNNs."
INTRODUCTION,0.022988505747126436,"While many different methods exist for choosing which parameters to prune, including ones that
take into account the gradient and the Hessian of the loss function (LeCun et al., 1989; Hassibi
& Stork, 1993; Yu et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; 2020), the simple approach of pruning based on
a global threshold of parameters’ magnitudes has been found to be robust and competitive with
more complicated, state-of-the-art methods (Blalock et al., 2020). In addition, early work on the
LTH found that magnitude pruning could be successfully performed early during training (although,
iteratively pruning based on magnitude was found to yield considerably better results) (Frankle &
Carbin, 2019). Subsequent research has related the point in training time when iterative magnitude
pruning can be successfully applied to a phenomenon known as “linear mode connectivity” (Frankle
et al., 2020). However, why magnitude pruning does not work before the emergence of linear mode"

INTRODUCTION,0.034482758620689655,"connectivity, is not well understood. Therefore, there is a need to develop new, theoretically driven
tools for studying magnitude pruning, especially pre-convergence (Frankle et al., 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.040229885057471264,"DNN training can be viewed as a discrete dynamical system, evolving the associated parameters
along a trajectory. Despite the fact that this perspective is familiar (indeed, it is often taught in intro-
ductions to gradient descent), the complex dependence of the trajectory on the choice of optimization
algorithm, architecture, activation functions, and data has kept dynamical systems theory from pro-
viding much insight into the behavior of DNNs. However, the recent development of Koopman
operator theory (Koopman, 1931; Koopman & Neumann, 1932; Mezi´c, 2005; Budiˇsi´c et al., 2012),
a rigorous, data-driven framework for studying nonlinear dynamical systems, has been successfully
applied to DNNs and machine learning, more generally (Dietrich et al., 2020; Dogra & Redman,
2020; Tano et al., 2020; Manojlovi´c et al., 2020; Mohr et al., 2021; Naiman & Azencot, 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.04597701149425287,"This recent success motivated us to ask whether we could leverage Koopman operator theory to pro-
vide insight into the pruning of DNNs. We ﬁrst made use of Koopman methods to deﬁne a new class
of pruning algorithms. One method in this class, which we refer to as Koopman magnitude pruning,
is shown to be equivalent to magnitude pruning at convergence. Early during training, we again ﬁnd
that the two methods can be equivalent. The dynamical systems perspective afforded by Koopman
pruning allows us to gain insight into the parameter dynamics present when the equivalence holds
and when it does not. We ﬁnd that the breaking of the equivalence occurs at a similar time that
non-trivial structure emerges within the DNN. Finally, we extend our work beyond magnitude based
pruning, showing that gradient pruning is equivalent to another form of Koopman pruning. Thus,
the Koopman framework uniﬁes magnitude and gradient pruning algorithms. Our contributions are
the following:"

KOOPMAN OPERATOR THEORY BASED PRUNING"
KOOPMAN OPERATOR THEORY BASED PRUNING,0.07471264367816093,"Koopman operator theory is a dynamical systems theory that lifts the nonlinear dynamics present
in a ﬁnite dimensional state space, to an inﬁnite dimensional function space, where the dynamics
are linear (Koopman, 1931; Koopman & Neumann, 1932; Mezi´c, 2005). While gaining an inﬁnite
number of dimensions would appear to make the problem intractable, numerical methods have been
developed over the past two decades to ﬁnd good ﬁnite dimensional approximations of the relevant
spectral objects (Mezi´c & Banaszuk, 2004; Mezi´c, 2005; Rowley et al., 2009; Schmid, 2010; Tu
et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2015; Mezi´c, 2020). Given the powerful and interpretable tools that
exist for studying linear systems, Koopman operator theory has found success in a number of applied
settings. Below we discuss the basics of Koopman mode decomposition, a key element of Koopman
operator theory, and use it to motivate a new class of pruning algorithms. We broadly refer to these
methods as Koopman based pruning. For more details on Koopman operator theory, we refer the
interested reader to Budiˇsi´c et al. (2012)."

data (see Sec. 2.3). The DNN parameter values that are set at initialization, θ(0), are the associated
initial condition [i.e. p = θ(0)]. The observable, g, could be chosen to be the identity function or
some other function that might be relevant to a given DNN, such as its loss or gradient. However,
note that Eq. 1 must hold for all g ∈F. For the remainder of the paper, it will be assumed that
the state space being considered is of ﬁnite dimension, and that F is the space of square-integrable

behavior of g amounts to considering only the φi(p)vi whose λi ≈1."
KOOPMAN MODE DECOMPOSITION,0.16091954022988506,"Given that the Koopman operator is linear, and it is known that even simple DNNs can have pa-
rameters that exhibit nonlinear dynamics (Saxe et al., 2014), it may seem that applying Koopman
methods to the training of DNNs is an over simpliﬁcation. However, the Hartman-Grobman The-
orem, a foundational result in dynamical systems theory, guarantees local neighborhoods around
hyperbolic ﬁxed points where the linearization captures the dynamical properties of the full, nonlin-
ear system (i.e. the two are conjugate) (Wiggins, 2003). Additional work by Lan & Mezi´c (2013)
extended the neighborhood where this conjugacy holds to the entirety of the basin. Therefore, as
long as the DNN is in a basin of attraction of some ﬁxed point, we can assume that the Koopman
mode decomposition will provide an accurate representation to the true, nonlinear dynamics."
KOOPMAN MODE DECOMPOSITION,0.16666666666666666,"There exist a number of different methods for computing the Koopman mode decomposition. While
they differ in their assumptions on the dynamics of the system, they are all data-driven and re-
quire multiple snapshots of some g. In the case of DNN training, we can take g to be the identity
function, and collect τ + 1 column vectors of the values the DNN parameters, θ, each taken at
a different training step. That is, to compute the Koopman mode decomposition, the data matrix
D = [θ(0), θ(1), ..., θ(τ)] ∈RN×(τ+1) must be constructed. For more details on the method used
in this paper to compute the Koopman modes, and its computational demands, see Appendix A."

has an associated Koopman operator, U, which governs the ﬂow of DNN parameters during training.
This Koopman operator, in turn, has various directions along which the ﬂow exponentially grows
and shrinks (i.e. the φi[θ(0)]vi)."
KOOPMAN BASED PRUNING,0.1839080459770115,"Previous work has shown that, over a non-trivial window of training, approximations of the Koop-
man operator can well capture weight and bias dynamics (Dogra & Redman, 2020; Tano et al.,
2020), suggesting that the φi[θ(0)]vi may be useful for pruning. If we order the modes by the real
part of their eigenvalues, i.e. re(λ1) > re(λ2) > ... > re(λR), and assume that λ1 = 1 (a reasonable
assumption in the case of stable dynamical systems, which we ﬁnd corroborated in our experiments
below), then φ1[θ(0)]v1 corresponds to the predicted ﬁxed point of training. That is, the ﬁrst mode
identiﬁes the parameter values that the DNN would take after training reached convergence. All ad-
ditional modes would identify parameters that experienced increasingly larger exponential decays."

KOOPMAN BASED PRUNING,0.2413793103448276,"These algorithms, KMP and KGP, are two of many possible realizations of pruning based on the
Koopman mode decomposition. For example, KMP can be easily extended to layer magnitude
pruning, by splitting φ1[θ(0)]v1 into subvectors and pruning each layer based on thresholds com-
puted from each subvector. Algorithm 1 provides a general form for Koopman based pruning. Note
that we follow standard practice in the pruning literature and denote a DNN by f(x; θ), where x
is its input and θ is its N parameters. The goal of pruning is to ﬁnd a mask, m ∈{0, 1}N, such
that the accuracy of f(x; θ ⊙m) is comparable to the original DNN. Here ⊙denotes element-wise
multiplication. To determine which parameters to prune (i.e. which mi = 0), a scoring function, s,

KOOPMAN OPERATOR’S DEPENDENCE ON ORDER OF TRAINING DATA"
KOOPMAN BASED PRUNING,0.25862068965517243,"As noted above, the dynamical map involved in training a DNN, T, is dependent on the choice of
optimizer, architecture, activation function, and order in which the training data is presented. Given
that the action of the Koopman operator is related to T via Eq. 1, the Koopman mode decomposition
must also be dependent on these quantities. In the experiments that are performed in the remainder
of this paper, optimizer, activation function, and architecture will be ﬁxed ahead of time. However,
because we made use of SGD, the ordering of the training data, referred to in some literature as
“SGD noise” (Frankle et al., 2020), will vary epoch to epoch."
KOOPMAN BASED PRUNING,0.26436781609195403,"A consequence of this is that, at each epoch, the dynamical system being considered will change, as
the mapping from θ(t) to θ(t + 1) will depend on which subset of training data is shown at training
iteration t. Note that it will also depend on the batch size (i.e. what fraction of the training data is
shown before updating θ), however this will also be ﬁxed in the experiments we perform. While
Koopman operator theory has been extended to random and non-autonomous dynamical systems
(Ma´ceˇsi´c et al., 2018; ˇCrnjari´c-ˇZic et al., 2020), we can view the training over the course of an
epoch as a deterministic process, by ﬁxing ahead of time the ordering of the training data. For the
remainder of this paper, we will be computing the Koopman mode decomposition for each epoch by
using only the parameter evolution data from that epoch."
KOOPMAN BASED PRUNING,0.27011494252873564,"The impact that SGD noise has on a DNN has been found to depend on the amount of training (Fran-
kle et al., 2020). Near initialization, two copies of the same DNN trained on different orderings of
the data lead to convergence on different local minima, whose linear path sees a “hill” (i.e. increase)
of testing error. This suggests that they are in different parts of the loss landscape. However, with
increased training, SGD noise brings the two copies of the DNN to the same “valley”, where their
linear path has no signiﬁcant rise in testing error. This phenomenon is called linear mode con-
nectivity (Frankle et al., 2020), and it is known to be related to the success of being able to ﬁnd"

with similar accuracy. To test these two hypotheses, we compare the overlap between the parameters
not pruned by GMP and KMP at different compressions and different epochs (see Appendix B for
more details on this metric). The right column of Fig. 3 shows that the two methods largely prune the
same parameters. From epochs 1-10, the mean overlap is roughly > 95%, even for a compression

Fig. 5), suggesting that SGD slowly re-orders the identity of the largest parameters epoch-to-epoch,
making these initial largest parameters inaccurate."
KOOPMAN MAGNITUDE PRUNING PRE-CONVERGENCE,0.40229885057471265,"By epoch 20, KMP and GMP stop being equivalent and, on average, start pruning a larger number
of different parameters. This implies that, even if the training data was ordered the exact same
way for all the remaining epochs, the identity of (some of) the largest parameters are expected to
evolve. To contrast this with the “static” dynamics found during epochs 1–10, we call this regime
“active”. We speculated that this change from “static” to “active” might be caused by emerging
structure in the parameter evolution. To test this, we pruned ResNet-20 at epochs 1 and 20 using
layer shufﬂe pruning (LSP). This method preserves the amount of compression in each layer, but
randomly chooses which parameters to remove. Previous work has found that many state-of-the-art
methods designed to prune at initialization do not do better than LSP (Frankle et al., 2021). We
ﬁnd that after only a single epoch of training, both GMP and KMP do no better, and in fact, do
worse, than LSP for nearly all compressions tested. However, by epoch 20, both GMP and KMP
were better than LSP for compression values of less than 16. These results support the idea that non-
trivial structure is emerging in the DNN at a similar time that KMP and GMP stop being equivalent.
When this structure is not present (e.g. at epoch 1), the two methods prune the same parameters."
KOOPMAN MAGNITUDE PRUNING PRE-CONVERGENCE,0.40804597701149425,"We also examined the ability of KMP and GMP to prune MnistNet, trained on MNIST, after epochs
1 and 20. While we found similar results to ResNet-20 (Figs. 2 and 3, left column), there are subtle
differences in the behavior of the overlap between pruning masks. For MnistNet, the overlap is
smallest at epochs 1 and 5, suggesting that the two methods are not equivalent at the earliest part
of training (Fig. 3, left). That this is different to what we found for ResNet-20 may be due to the
fact that the two models are at different phases of training at equivalent epochs. Previous work
has shown that, shortly after initialization, linear mode connectivity emerges in LeNet, trained on
MNIST (Frankle et al., 2020). This does not happen for ResNet-20, trained on CIFAR-10, until
at least epoch 5. Additionally, we ﬁnd that, for MnistNet, KMP and GMP outperform LSP for
compression above 8 as early as epoch 1. These MnistNet results further support the fact that, as
structure beyond what LSP can ﬁnd emerges, the dynamics associated with the identity of the largest
parameters goes from being “static” to “active”."

ters is given by the sum of ˜θi times their decaying eigenvalues. While there are R −1 modes in this
sum, those with large norms (i.e. |˜θi| ≫0) are expected to make the most substantial contribution.
For simplicity, we consider only the largest modes that also have real, positive eigenvalues. These
modes have easily interpretable dynamics (i.e. exponential decay) and are directly related to ∇θL.

is very similar to pruning using the scoring function s(θ) = |∇θL|, a method we refer to as just
gradient pruning (JGP) (Fig. 4, right). We note that we only expect the two methods to be “nearly”
equivalent (and not truly equivalent, as in the case of KMP and GMP in the long training time limit)
because, KGP ﬁnds exponential decaying modes from dynamic data, whereas JGP is the average
gradient computed over a batch of input data (Blalock et al., 2020)."

DISCUSSION,0.4942528735632184,"Inspired by the widespread success Koopman operator theory has found in a number of applied
ﬁelds, and its recent application to problems in machine learning, we extended Koopman tools to
study deep neural network pruning (Janowsky, 1989; Mozer & Smolensky, 1989a;b; LeCun et al.,
1989; Karnin, 1990; Han et al., 2015; Blalock et al., 2020). By making use of the Koopman mode
decomposition, we deﬁned a new class of pruning algorithms (Algorithm 1) that are theoretically
motivated and data-driven in implementation. We found that both global magnitude and gradient
pruning (Blalock et al., 2020) have equivalent (or nearly equivalent) methods at certain regimes of"

DISCUSSION,0.5057471264367817,"training in the Koopman framework (Figs. 1, 4). In this way, Koopman pruning provides a uniﬁed
perspective on these “disparate” methods."
DISCUSSION,0.5114942528735632,"Applying KMP to DNNs in the early part of training revealed that it could be equivalent to GMP (Fig.
3). From a dynamical systems perspective, this equivalence implies that the largest parameters, at
the end of each epoch, are the same ones that are expected to remain the largest, if training continued
using the same ordering of the data. We refer to this behavior as “static”. Given that we found the
identity of the largest parameters evolved with training (Appendix B, Fig. 5), pruning too early may
conﬁne the sparsiﬁed DNN to a subspace where it stays in the static regime and therefore is unable
ﬁnd a good local minimum. This is additionally supported by the fact that layer shufﬂe pruning
(LSP) outperforms GMP during this part of training, suggesting that the structure present in the
GMP mask is more “harmful” than a randomly structured mask (Fig. 2)."
DISCUSSION,0.5172413793103449,"However, at a certain subsequent point in training, the masks produced by GMP and KMP stop
overlapping as completely (Fig. 3). This suggests that there is some transition in the dynamics, with
the largest parameters becoming “active”. As this transition seems to occur at a similar time that
GMP starts to outperform LSP, and at a similar time that linear mode connectivity has been reported
to emerge (Frankle et al., 2020), we speculate that it is related to the sparsiﬁed DNN still being able
to evolve and ﬁnd a good local minima in the subspace it is restricted to."
DISCUSSION,0.5229885057471264,"By making use of ShrinkBench, our results can be easily replicated and avoid some of the bad
practices that have been recently identiﬁed as being pervasive in the DNN pruning literature (Blalock
et al., 2020). Our custom implementations are integrated into the ShrinkBench framework, allowing
for additional investigation into Koopman pruning."
DISCUSSION,0.5287356321839081,"While dynamical systems theory is a natural language with which to frame DNN optimization,
the complex dependencies on optimizer, architecture, activation function, and training data have
historically kept efforts in this direction to a minimum. This has led to a reliance on heuristic
methods, such as iterative magnitude pruning, whose basis of success is still not clear (Elesedy
et al., 2021). Other groups have attempted to more principally examine DNN behavior by studying
spectral objects, such as the spectrum of the Hessian matrix (Gur-Ari et al., 2018) and the spectrum
of the weight matrices (Martin et al., 2021). This work has been inﬂuential and led to new insight,
however the connection between these metrics and the (future) dynamics of DNN training is not
direct. An exception to this is the recent work on using inertial manifold theory to study the Lottery
Ticket Hypothesis, which is similar in spirit to our Koopman based pruning methods (Zhang et al.,
2021)."

and provides insight on how training dynamics impact the success of magnitude pruning. To the
best of our knowledge, these could not have been done using any other linearization method (e.g.
principal component analysis). We believe that continued exchange between the Koopman and
machine learning communities will lead to further advances."

PERFORMING KOOPMAN MODE DECOMPOSITION"
REFERENCES,0.8908045977011494,"As discussed in the main text, many different methods have been developed to perform Koopman
mode decomposition. One very popular class of approaches is dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)
(Schmid, 2010), and its many related variants. Seminal work by Rowley et al. (2009) showed that
DMD, as originally proposed, could be equivalent to Koopman mode decomposition. Because of
its popularity and noted connection to Koopman operator theory, we made use of one such DMD
method, called Exact DMD (Tu et al., 2014), in this work."

DNN’s parameters, θ ∈RN, during all but the last iteration of training during an epoch (i.e. there
are τ + 1 iterations during an epoch). Here T is the nonlinear dynamical map that evolves the DNN
parameters, which is dependent on the choice of optimization algorithm, architecture, activation
function, and ordering of training data. Let Y = [θ(1), θ(2), ..., θ(τ)]. Exact DMD does not require
X and Y to be built from sequential time-series data, but we assumed it here."

Koopman mode, ˜θ∗, took 44 seconds and 1.1 GB of memory usage for the ResNet-20 experiments,
and 210 seconds and 1.1 GB of memory usage for MnistNet experiments. Memory usage was
computed using the Python module memory-proﬁler 0.58.04. A single epoch’s worth of data (i.e.
391 iterations for ResNet-20 and 469 iterations for MnistNet) were used to construct the Koopman
operator. Despite MnistNet having ≈1.6× as many parameters as ResNet-20, the similar amount of
memory usage required for both comes from the fact that we employed reduced SVD, which keeps
only as many singular values as there are snapshots, which is comparable across the two DNNs (391
and 469)."

SCALING UP KOOPMAN PRUNING"
REFERENCES,0.9482758620689655,"Given that Koopman based pruning requires performing decompositions on matrices whose total
number of elements scale as the square of the number of parameters present in the DNN, scaling
up Koopman pruning to larger DNNs may seem intractable. However, the ﬁeld of ﬂuid dynamics,
where Koopman has been extensively applied (Mezi´c, 2013), often deals with a similar problem,
having the dimensionality of the state space being very large [e.g. ≈105−9 (Luchtenburg & Rowley,
2011)]. Because of this, numerical methods have been developed, such as the method of snapshots
(Sirovich, 1987) to efﬁciently compute the SVD of large matrices. These can, and have, been eas-
ily incorporated into methods used to compute the Koopman mode decomposition. Therefore, we
expect that leveraging similar approaches should make scaling Koopman pruning to larger DNNs
tractable."
