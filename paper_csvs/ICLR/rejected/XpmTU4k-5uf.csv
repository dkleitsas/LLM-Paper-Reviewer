ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.003663003663003663,"Safe deployment of trained ML models requires determining when they are un-
certain of their predictions and refraining from using them for decision-making.
Existing approaches inspect test samples in isolation to estimate their correspond-
ing predictive uncertainty. However, in the real-world, deployed models typically
see test inputs consecutively and predict labels continuously over time during infer-
ence. We propose TIME-LAPSE, an uncertainty scoring framework that examines
a sequence of latent-space embeddings over time prior to the current sample to
determine its predictive uncertainty. Speciﬁcally, (a) our spatial uncertainty score
estimates uncertainty using distance metrics (Mahalanobis distance) and similarity
metrics (cosine similarity) in the latent-space and (b) our temporal uncertainty
score determines deviations in correlations over time using representations of past
inputs in a non-parametric, sliding-window based algorithm. We evaluate TIME-
LAPSE through the lens of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and dataset shift
detection on tasks over diverse domains: audio and vision using public datasets and
further benchmark our approach on a challenging, real-world, electroencephalo-
grams (EEG) dataset for seizure detection. We achieve state-of-the-art results for
OOD detection in the audio and EEG domain and observe considerable gains in
semantically corrected vision benchmarks. We show that TIME-LAPSE is more
driven by semantic content compared to other methods, i.e., it is more robust to
dataset statistics. We also show that TIME-LAPSE outperforms spatial methods
signiﬁcantly through our sequential evaluation framework that emulates real-life
drift settings through extensive experiments and ablations."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01098901098901099,"Modern machine learning (ML) has seen tremendous success in various tasks across multiple domains
(Bojarski et al., 2016; Hinton, 2018; Kreinovich & Kosheleva, 2020; van den Oord et al., 2016),
surpassing human performance in many benchmarks (Esteva et al., 2017; Yala et al., 2019; Krizhevsky
et al., 2012). However, deep learning models have been known to fail silently and catastrophically
with highly conﬁdent predictions (Nguyen et al., 2015; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2017).
Such models assume a closed world scenario, i.e., they assume that variability encountered when
deployed in the real-world would be similar to the variability present in their training data. In
practice, they encounter an open world where incoming samples can come from shifted distributions
or completely new distributions (Liu et al., 2020). This behaviour can have severe consequences
in mission-critical domains such as healthcare and autonomous driving, where errors can be costly,
resulting in injury or even death (Amodei et al., 2016). Most widely cited models do not come with
an uncertainty scoring mechanism to say “I don’t know” or to abstain from prediction (Kompa et al.,
2021). As deployed ML models are used to inform real-world decisions, it is important that they have
the ability to understand when they ought to be “unsure”. A good uncertainty scoring framework
must assign higher uncertainty estimates when the network is faced with distributional shifts or
new semantic content, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) data but must be certain (low uncertainty) and
generalize well on learnt distributions yet unseen data (in-distribution or InD data)."
INTRODUCTION,0.014652014652014652,"The task of identifying when incoming inputs are drawn far from the training distribution is called
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. At its core, it is a binary classiﬁcation problem, evaluated using
measures such as area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), area under the precision recall
curve (AUPR) and false positive rate at 80% true positive rate (FPR80). Current OOD evaluation"

INTRODUCTION,0.02564102564102564,"schemes hold different datasets to be OOD sources, without considering if the distinctions are
semantic in nature (Ahmed & Courville, 2020) leading to methods that are insensitive to semantic
overlap and biased to dataset statistics. Closely related is the task of dataset shift detection (Moreno-
Torres et al., 2012), crucial for deployed systems. Dataset shift can occur due to sample selection
bias, non-stationary environments, missing values, new concepts evolving over time, etc. Most ML
systems do not evaluate their ability to detect such shifts, presenting a huge gap between models
performing well on test sets and models capable of being deployed in the wild."
INTRODUCTION,0.029304029304029304,"In this paper, we propose TIME-LAPSE, a predictive uncertainty quantiﬁcation framework using
latent space embeddings over time, evaluated through downstream tasks of OOD detection and
dataset shift detection. A key insight in our approach is that most real-world scenarios (such as
electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure analysis, healthcare decision making, autonomous driving, etc.)
involve consecutive inputs to the model that are likely to be correlated over time. For example,
an obstacle detector deployed in a self-driving car will see images correlated over time. A seizure
detector installed in a neurology clinic will process hours of time-correlated EEG signals. Even
low-risk image classiﬁcation models deployed in search engines over the cloud will see correlated
inputs over time when grouped by user ID or location. Thus, sequentially occurring samples share
meaningful semantic correlations."
INTRODUCTION,0.03296703296703297,"In TIME-LAPSE (Fig. 1), we compute spatial uncertainty scores based on the following hypotheses:
an encoder with enough inductive bias likely (a) maps OOD inputs “far"" from other InD samples in the
latent space under the Mahalanobis distance metric (Lee et al., 2018) and (b) produces dissimilarities
between their representations under the cosine similarity metric (Jones & Furnas, 1987). We compute
temporal uncertainty scores by exploiting correlations between lower dimensional representations of
consecutive samples over time when examined as a sequence. A sequence of InD inputs will show
more correlation than a sequence with both InD and OOD inputs or a sequence with just OOD inputs."
INTRODUCTION,0.03663003663003663,"Recent works limit themselves to OOD detection tasks with evaluations purely on highly curated
image benchmarks, but do not extend their tests to more diverse and realistic scenarios required for
practical applications (Ren et al., 2019; Ahmed & Courville, 2020). Such OOD image benchmarks
consider different datasets to be OOD sources, neglecting any semantic overlap between their OOD
test sets and InD train sets, leading to narrow model capabilities (Yang et al., 2021). We show that

uncertainty.
• We show that scores from TIME-LAPSE are driven by semantic content and are more robust
to dataset statistics whereas popular baselines, benchmarked on standard image datasets, are
susceptible to dataset statistics and overlook semantic overlap for OOD detection.
• We benchmark TIME-LAPSE on diverse domains: audio speech classiﬁcation, seizure detection
using clinical EEGs and image classiﬁcation. TIME-LAPSE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in
audio tasks, the EEG domain and semantically corrected image benchmarks.
• We propose a sequential evaluation framework for dataset shift detection to evaluate methods under

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.05860805860805861,"Uncertainty estimation is a rich ﬁeld with a long history. Classical techniques include density
estimation (Breunig et al., 2000), one-class SVMs (Schölkopf et al., 1999), tree-isolation forests (Liu
et al., 2008), etc for one-dimensional data such as time-series However, such techniques scale badly
with input dimensionality (Rabanser et al., 2019). Calibration is a frequentist notion of uncertainty,
measured by proper scoring rules like log-loss or Brier scoring (Guo et al., 2017; DeGroot & Fienberg,
1983; Dawid, 1982). Uncertainty estimation for deep neural networks (NNs) (Lakshminarayanan
et al., 2017) typically use a Bayesian formalism to learn distributions over model weights (Blundell
et al., 2015; Malinin & Gales, 2018; Chen et al., 2019; Graves, 2011; Neal, 1996; Welling & Teh,
2011). However, most Bayesian methods are difﬁcult to train and computationally expensive. Gal &
Ghahramani (2016) use Monte-Carlo dropout at test-time with an approximate Bayesian interpretation
to derive uncertainty estimates.It is also computationally expensive, requiring k forward passes for
each instance during inference. Quality of uncertainty estimates are commonly evaluated using
OOD detection. Moreno-Torres et al. (2012) give a complete overview of closely related topics
of distributional shift detection including covariate shift, label shift and concept drift (Gama et al.,
2014). Several works consider semi-supervised techniques for OOD such as outlier exposure methods
(Hendrycks et al., 2019a; Ruff et al., 2020), while many assume the supervised setting where the
target OOD distribution is known and propose alternative training strategies and auxillary OOD tasks
(DeVries & Taylor, 2018; Hendrycks et al., 2019b; Mohseni et al., 2020; Shalev et al., 2018) in a
multi-task setting. In this paper, we consider the more general setting of unsupervised OOD detection
where no OOD examples are labelled as such and the encoder has access to only InD training labels.
Other methods use representations from NNs to infer OOD inputs. Hendrycks & Gimpel (2017)
use maximum softmax probabilites (MSP) to detect OOD data. Liang et al. (2018) improve this by
introducing a temperature parameter to the softmax equation. Lee et al. (2018) ﬁt class-conditional
Gaussians to intermediate activations and use the Mahalanobis distance to identify OOD samples.
Recently, some works use self-supervision to get better representations to improve OOD detection
(Tack et al., 2020; Winkens et al., 2020; Sehwag et al., 2021). Several methods directly use input
likelihoods as the OOD detection score. However, studies have shown that generative techniques may
be overconﬁdent on complex inputs (Nalisnick et al., 2019). Modiﬁed likelihood scores have been
proposed since then (Serrà et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2019) including energy-based
models (Liu et al., 2020; Du & Mordatch, 2019; Grathwohl et al., 2020) and likelihood ratios (Ren"

and primarily use auto-encoders (Zong et al., 2018; Pidhorskyi et al., 2018) or GANs (Schlegl et al.,
2017; Deecke et al., 2019; Perera et al., 2019). Our temporal uncertainty scores builds upon and
shares similarity to change point detection methods in time-series data (Aminikhanghahi & Cook,
2017; Kifer et al., 2004) along with signal processing techniques such as Particle and Kalman ﬁltering
(van der Merwe et al., 2001; Kalman, 1960)."

OOD detection performance using standard metrics: area under the receiver operating characteristic

as outliers. Standard OOD benchmarks treat different datasets to be OOD resulting in models
with narrow capabilities susceptible to dataset bias (Ahmed & Courville, 2020; Yang et al., 2021).
Moreover, they fail to capture any semantic overlap between different datasets, e.g., if a model is
trained to classify cats from dogs and is shown a breed of dog (high semantic overlap) from a different
dataset during inference, it should be considered InD whereas a mufﬁn would be OOD since it has no

Left, Bird, etc) in GSC have never been encountered by the model and have drastic semantic shifts in
their content when compared to the InD classes 0-9 and are considered OOD. During evaluation, we
show the model unseen samples from each of the classes in GSC along with samples from the Free
Spoken Digits Dataset (FSDD) which contains classes 0-9 (same semantic content as InD data but
different dataset) and measure OOD detection performance (Table 2). As an ablation, we examine the
performance when we ﬂip the FSDD classes to be OOD data in our evaluation. We see that AUROC,
AUPR and FPR80 values for most baselines (notably Test-time Dropout and Predictive Entropy)
increase signiﬁcantly, whereas they drop for TIME-LAPSE and vanilla Mahalanobis (Table 2). This
shows that our strongest baseline methods have narrow capabilities that assume only data belonging
to InD classes and having the same dataset statistics as the training data will be considered as InD. All
other data will be rejected as OOD, leading to very high FPRs in practice. In contrast, TIME-LAPSE
is able to identify true InD samples despite differing dataset statistics, i.e. TIME-LAPSE detects
OOD samples based on semantic content than dataset statistics when compared to the other methods."

leaving out classes Airplane, Bird and Dog. SVHN data consists of images of numbers and has no
semantic overlap with any of the 7 InD classes (Automobile, Cat, Deer, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck).
To study the effect of semantic overlap, we consider the 100 classes from CIFAR100 along with the
3 left out classes from CIFAR10. We compare the performance metrics when naively considering
all of the above as OOD ignoring any semantic overlap. We see that baselines perform better while
TIME-LAPSE drops (Table 1). We analyse class-wise performance and we see that TIME-LAPSE’s
performance strongly correlates to semantic content compared to other methods. For example,
consider Class Pickup-Truck and Streetcar from CIFAR100. While they are disjoint from the InD
classes Automobile and Truck in CIFAR10, they shares a high degree of semantic content and should
be considered InD. When models encounter samples from classes that have high semantic overlap
with InD, they need to consider them InD and not OOD. Instead, if such samples are considered
OOD, only methods that have narrow model capacities will show high detection performance (Table
3) indicating their dependence on data statistics instead of semantic content."

DRIFT DETECTION: SEQUENTIAL EVALUATION RESULTS"
AFFINITY FOR SEMANTIC CONTENT AND ROBUSTNESS TO DATASET STATISTICS,0.31868131868131866,"To evaluate the performance under our sequential framework, we deﬁne the detector to have erred if
it wrongly concludes an incoming test sample xt to be OOD when it is actually InD or vice-versa.
If the framework detects the change point within its ﬁxed window size, we do not consider it as
an error. We generate data streams of length 10,000 samples changing the distribution every k
samples in each trial The distribution changes are simulated by ﬁrst randomly choosing InD or OOD
(Bernoulli random variable with probability p ∈{0.2, 0.5, 0.7}) and then randomly drawing the
k ∈{50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 5000} samples from the chosen distribution. We calculate the TIME-
LAPSE scores using the two-sided Mann-Whitney test (Mann & Whitney, 1947) at a signiﬁcance
level of 0.05 for each sample in the stream and run it through our sequential detector with window
sizes wA = wB = 25 for vision experiments and wA = wB = 50 for audio and EEG experiments.
We show example plots of datastreams for each domain in the Appendix, Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9. We perform a 2-cluster KMeans on the generated Mann-Whitney scores to assign InD and OOD
predictions. We then calculate the cumulative error by adding the errors of all samples to calculate
detection error. We repeat this experiment N times (N = 1000 here) to estimate the detector’s error
distribution (EEG distribution given in the Fig. 2, Appendix). Over 73% of the cumulative errors
in our EEG task (over 85% for our audio task) lie within 10% and over 93% of the errors in our
EEG task (over 97% for our audio task) lie within 20% indicating our detector’s high performance in
comparison to other spatial detectors. For our vision tasks, the error distribution is much tighter and
we are able to get near 99% detection accuracy for over 95% of the time."

AFFINITY FOR SEMANTIC CONTENT AND ROBUSTNESS TO DATASET STATISTICS,0.3333333333333333,"To study the effects of encoder capacity on TIME-LAPSE, we consider our audio task. We compare
two encoders, trained on the same InD data and evaluated with the same OOD data. The lower
capacity encoder, Kymatio, is a two-layer network with a log-scattering layer that extracts scattering
coefﬁcients from the inputs as latent space embeddings, followed by a log-softmax layer for clas-
siﬁcation with 0.75 classiﬁcation accuracy for InD test samples. The higher capacity encoder is a
CNN-based M5 model with 0.85 classiﬁcation accuracy for InD test samples. As shown in Fig. 10
(Appendix F), Kymatio is not able to separate out any of the classes based on TIME-LAPSE scores
whereas M5 is able to correctly separate out semantic InD samples from OOD samples well. Thus,
the success of TIME-LAPSE is highly dependent on the capacity of the model."
AFFINITY FOR SEMANTIC CONTENT AND ROBUSTNESS TO DATASET STATISTICS,0.336996336996337,"To further investigate the effects of the lower capacity model, we train Kymatio for the same task
(i.e., same InD semantic classes 0-9) but with the much smaller FSDD dataset. The model reaches
0.97 classiﬁcation accuracy, showing that it is able to express high-dimensional audio signals well.
However, on comparing its TIME-LAPSE scores with those of Kymatio trained on GSC 0-9 (Fig
11, Appendix F), we see that the former separates out FSDD InD from GSC InD and GSC OOD,
indicating that it is overﬁtting to dataset statistics whereas the latter is not able to separate out any
of them. Thus, TIME-LAPSE scores can help in determining both OOD detection capability of an
encoder as well as generalization capability over OOD samples."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.3443223443223443,"In this work, we develop a unique uncertainty scoring framework that can identify when incoming in-
puts fall out-of-distribution with respect to trained encoders and subsequently enable models to abstain
from prediction on such inputs. Our theoretical formulation encompasses all representation-based
OOD detection methods and provides an opportunity to leverage temporal signals in combination. We
show that longitudinal information across time can be leveraged for the challenging task of identifying
distributional shifts. Through our ablations (Appendix D), we verify that temporal uncertainty scores
and spatial uncertainty scores are complementary and combining them gives additional information
than when used separately. We use latent-space embeddings to determine spatial uncertainty and
proposed a simple sliding-window hypothesis-testing based approach to model temporal uncertainty
But TIME-LAPSE can accept any type of spatial scoring and temporal scoring. We believe that there
is scope for developing sophisticated methods that leverage the temporal aspect and leave it open for
future work."
DISCUSSION,0.34798534798534797,"Furthermore, alongside works by Ahmed & Courville (2020) and Yang et al. (2021), we motivate the
necessity of rethinking standard OOD image benchmarks that disregard semantic overlaps. We note
that the task of identifying OOD inputs is highly dependent on context. For a classiﬁer trained to
identify cats and dogs, a tree is OOD whereas all of them would be InD for an object recognition
system in a self-driving car. We believe that showing generalizability of OOD detection methods
across domains is key to ensure robust performance in the wild. It is not sufﬁcient to show better
performance over just image OOD benchmarks. We show that TIME-LAPSE generalizes across 3
diverse domains- vision, audio and healthcare EEG, through our extensive experiments and analyses.
We also propose a sequential evaluation framework to view OOD detection from the lens of dataset
drift detection. To enable safe deployment and periodic monitoring of trained models, we believe
that such a sequence-based evaluation scheme is essential. We hope this evaluation scheme will be
adopted for routinely characterizing uncertainty estimation and model performance in the wild."
DISCUSSION,0.3516483516483517,"For our experiments, we train encoders with labelled InD data in a supervised setting. But our
framework will support and beneﬁt from more robust representations (Section 5.4, Appendix F)
learnt via self-supervision or semi-supervision. We also note that both the audio and seizure analyses
generate much higher-dimensional inputs compared to image classiﬁcation. We hypothesize that
model performance is strongly dependent on semantic content for such high-dimensional inputs when
compared to dataset statistics and thus, gains from TIME-LAPSE are more obvious."
DISCUSSION,0.3553113553113553,"In conclusion, we provide a framework that utilizes both latent-space and time to determine predictive
uncertainty for deep learning models. Our method is end-to-end trainable and network agnostic: it
(a) does not require exposure to outliers (though can easily be extended to accommodate them if
present), (b) does not require modiﬁcations to existing network architectures, and (c) does not require
computationally heavy dropout techniques or ensemble passes. It can thus can be easily adopted to
high-risk settings such as clinical workﬂows and autonomous driving."

detection and dataset need to be benchmarked and evaluated on diverse datasets and domains aside

ABLATIONS: CORESET SIZE"
REFERENCES,0.8754578754578755,"TIME-LAPSE’s spatial score uses the cosine similarity metric to compare the similarity of a test
sample’s latent-space embeddings to those of the training data pairwise. Potentially, this could be
a computationally intensive process, especially for large dataset sizes. We reduce the computation
costs, memory overhead and latency by using a subset of training data (coreset) instead of the full
training set. The coreset is extracted by randomly sampling a fraction from every class in the training
data. We show that in case of a large dataset, a small coreset will be sufﬁcient to achieve a similar
performance for downstream tasks. We can see from Table 9 that just 2% to 10% of the training
dataset is sufﬁcient to achieve a similar performance as using the full training dataset. In fact, for our
clinical EEG dataset, we use just 2% of the training samples for all spatial score calculations and
reach the state-of-the-art. This encouraging result also paves the way for choosing different sampling
strategies that can ensure more ""representational"" samples (based on domain knowledge) from the
training set are included in the coreset as part of future work. We note that similar trends with coresets

QUALITATIVE ANALYSES"
REFERENCES,0.9084249084249084,"We plot the UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018) embeddings of our raw InD data and their extracted latent
space representations from the trained encoders along with those of OOD data. Fig. 12 shows the
plots for our audio GSC dataset. We see that the raw data are too high-dimensional to be captured
according to their class labels by UMAP. On the other hand, the extracted representations arrange
themselves in well-separable clusters showing the representational capacity of the trained encoder.
Most distance-based OOD detectors assume OOD representations will get mapped far away from
the InD representations in the latent-space. This is a good assumption and holds in many cases.
Indeed, the spatial scorer in TIME-LAPSE uses this hypothesis (along with others) to derive its
predictive uncertainty score. However, OOD inputs can get mapped very close to InD inputs in the
representational space under most distance metrics. Fig. 12 (right) shows the overlay of OOD inputs
in the latent-space. Although it is just a 2D projection and the extracted representations have higher
dimensions, this ﬁgure still shows that OOD inputs can get mapped near to InD inputs. In that case,
purely distance-based spatial scores lose their power. TIME-LAPSE looks at multiple hypotheses
to determine if samples are OOD. We ﬁnd that the combination of our similarity score and distance
score outperform each score individually. Moreover, since TIME-LAPSE has a temporal component
to it, the temporal scorer acts as an additional constraint to ensure OOD inputs are separable. Thus,
within a few samples, TIME-LAPSE can indicate when samples are going out-of-distribution with
much better accuracy."
