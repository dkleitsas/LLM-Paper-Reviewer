ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0031746031746031746,"Distributional reinforcement learning aims to learn distribution of return under
stochastic environments. Since the learned distribution of return contains rich in-
formation about the stochasticity of the environment, previous studies have relied
on descriptive statistics, such as standard deviation, for optimism in the face of
uncertainty. However, using the uncertainty from an empirical distribution can
hinder convergence and performance when exploring with the certain criterion
that has an one-sided tendency on risk in these methods. In this paper, we pro-
pose a novel distributional reinforcement learning that explores by randomizing
risk criterion to reach a risk-neutral optimal policy. First, we provide a perturbed
distributional Bellman optimality operator by distorting the risk measure in ac-
tion selection. Second, we prove the convergence and optimality of the proposed
method by using the weaker contraction property. Our theoretical results support
that the proposed method does not fall into biased exploration and is guaranteed
to converge to an optimal return distribution. Finally, we empirically show that
our method outperforms other existing distribution-based algorithms in various
environments including Atari games."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.009523809523809525,"Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) learns the stochasticity of returns in the reinforcement
learning environments and has shown remarkable performance in several benchmark tasks. Its model
generates the approximated distribution of returns, where the mean value implies the traditional Q-
value (Bellemare et al., 2017; Dabney et al., 2018b; Choi et al., 2019). Learning procedure with
stochasticity through return distribution is represented by parametric (epistemic) uncertainty, which
is due to insufficient or inaccurate data, and intrinsic (aleatoric) uncertainty, which is inherently
possessed randomness in the environment. (Chow et al., 2015; Dabney et al., 2018a) The learned
stochasticity gives rise to the notion of risk-sensitivity, and some distributional reinforcement learn-
ing algorithms distort the learned distribution to create a risk-averse or risk-seeking policy."
INTRODUCTION,0.012698412698412698,"Another way to employ the uncertainty is to design an efficient exploration method which is essential
to find an optimal behavior with a few number of trials. Optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU)
is one of the fundamental exploration principles that employs parametric uncertainty to promote
exploring less understood behaviors and to construct confidence set. Most OFU algorithms select an
action with the highest upper-confidence bound (UCB) of uncertainty which can be considered as the
optimistic decision at the moment (Chen et al., 2017; Ciosek et al., 2019). In deep RL, several OFU
studies often model the uncertainty explicitly through the Bayesian posterior, which is estimated by
using neural networks. However, learning the representation of high-dimensional state-action space
and Bellman update simultaneously leads to unstable propagation(Yang et al., 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.015873015873015872,"On the other hand, DRL can provide more statistical information during control such as mode, me-
dian, or variance by addressing full characteristics of the return distribution. Despite the richness
of information for return distribution, only a few DRL methods have tried to employ the benefits
of distributional perspective for exploration (Tang & Agrawal, 2018; Mavrin et al., 2019; Clements
et al., 2019). To estimate the uncertainty from distributional outputs, descriptive statistics that is
composed of a mixture of intrinsic and parametric uncertainty can be utilized. Unfortunately, sepa-"

INTRODUCTION,0.022222222222222223,"rating these two types of uncertainty during learning is not a trivial task. Mavrin et al. (2019) propose
a distribution-based OFU exploration that schedules a decaying bonus rate to suppress the effect of
intrinsic uncertainty, which unintentionally induces a risk-seeking policy. Although OFU based ap-
proaches try to reduce parametric uncertainty by revisiting the state with high uncertainty, there
exists the side effect that the criteria unfortunately forces the agent to chase the intrinsic uncertainty
(risk) simultaneously during updates. Relying on a specific criteria causes an one-sided tendency on
risk and makes an agent consistently select certain actions during exploration as degrading perfor-
mance. We call this phenomenon as stuckness."
INTRODUCTION,0.025396825396825397,"In this paper, we introduce perturbed quantile regression (PQR) which perturbs the criterion on un-
certainty by randomizing the risk criterion in action selection. First, the distributional perturbation on
return distribution is to re-evaluate the estimate of return by distorting the learned distribution with
perturbation weight. Unlike the typical worst-case approach in risk-sensitive settings or OFU based
approaches, we instead randomly sample a risk measure from an ambiguity set, which represents
that the risk setting is ambiguous when the characteristics of a given environment are unknown. We
empirically demonstrate on the stochastic variant of N-Chain environment (Osband et al., 2016) that
a randomized scheme is more effective than OFU to alleviate the sub-optimality problem of tendency
to obtain risk-seeking policies. Second, any risk-measure with some time-varying perturbation con-
straint allows us to average over all possible risk-sensitive behaviors to achieve the optimal policy.
We provide a sufficient condition for the convergence of return distribution in the weaker contrac-
tion property. Our method covers the full elements of the reinforcement learning with distributional
perspective from the novel exploration method with distributional perturbation to the theoretically
guaranteed convergence of return distribution, which has the same fixed-point with the standard
Bellman optimality operator. The proposed algorithm is based on QR-DQN, which is a baseline of
DRL architecture to learn a return distribution, and we show that PQR outperforms QR-DQN and
other DRL baselines in several benchmark environments, LunarLander-v2 and Atari games."

Based on the quantile regression, Dabney et al. (2018b) have proposed a quantile regression deep Q
network (QR-DQN) that shows better empirical performance than the categorical approach (Belle-
mare et al., 2017) since the quantile regression does not restrict the bounds for return. As deep RL
typically did, QR-DQN adjusts ϵ-greedy schedule, which selects the greedy action with probability
1 −ϵ and otherwise selects random available actions uniformly. The majority of QR-DQN variants
(Dabney et al., 2018a; Yang et al., 2019) rely on the same exploration method. However, such ap-
proaches do not put aside inferior actions from the selection list and thus suffers from a loss (Osband
et al., 2019). Hence, selecting a statistically plausible action is crucial for efficient exploration."

RISK IN DISTRIBUTIONAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,0.1111111111111111,"Instead of an expected value, risk-sensitive RL tries to maximize a risk measure such as Mean-
Variance (Zhang et al., 2020), Value-at-Risk (VaR) (Chow et al., 2017), or Conditional Value-at-Risk
(CVaR) (Rockafellar et al., 2000; Rigter et al., 2021), which result in different classes of optimal
policy. Especially, Dabney et al. (2018a) interprets risk measures as the expected utility function of
the return, i.e., EZ[U(Z(s, a))]. Under this interpretation, risk-sensitive RL can be formulated as
the maximization problem with various types of utility functions. If the utility function U is linear,
the policy obtained under such risk measure is called risk-neutral. If U is concave or convex, the
resulting policy is termed as risk-averse or risk-seeking, respectively. In general, a distortion risk
measure is a generalized expression of risk measure generated from the distortion function.

making. Dabney et al. (2018a) expanded the class of policies on arbitrary distortion risk measures
and investigated the effects of a distinct distortion risk measures by changing the sampling distri-
bution for quantile targets τ. Unlike the usual risk-sensitive RL, DLTV applied the risk measure
only on action selection, while it keeps the standard objective to obtain a risk-neutral optimal policy.
Our analysis shows that risk-based exploration can utilize risk measures in two different ways: (1)
selecting action and (2) evaluating the value function by using distorted (perturbed) expectation."

Despite the simple configuration, the possibility to obtain a higher reward in the suboptimal state
than the optimal state makes the agent difficult which policy is optimal until it experiences enough

MOTIVATION,0.19047619047619047,"In Figure 2(a), DLTV fails to estimate the true optimal return distribution of action a1. Due to the
erroneous estimation, the agent takes longer to recognize its error. Hence, the deterministic selection
based on a fixed criteria could mislead toward exploitation rather than exploration. This indicates that
DLTV may not gather experiences well in a complex environment that requires deep exploration. In
Figure 2(b), we plot the point when the optimal policy was actually performed for each algorithm
to show stuckness. Since the optimal policy consists of only the same index a1, we plot the total
count of performing the optimal action with 10 different seeds. The slope indicates the ratio of
performing the optimal policy on average. Hence, the interval with a slope of 1 implies that the
optimal policy was performed every time. From the slope of each line, it is observed that DLTV
selects the suboptimal action even if the optimal policy was initially performed. Although the mean
return of a1 (move left) is estimated to be superior, the agent only selects a2 (move right) during
training due to its consistent optimism on uncertainty. Even if DLTV has spent enough number of

selection as it starts from a decreased coefficient."

As the mean of each return is designed to be similar, it is useful to examine the learning
behavior of the empirical return distribution for each algorithm. Figure 3 shows the empirical PDF
of return distribution by using Gaussian kernel density estimation. PQR estimates the ground truth
much better than other baselines with much closer mean and standard-deviation. Although the op-
timal policy was performed, QR-DQN overestimates the optimal Q-value of (s2, a1) as ˆµ = 9.33
while the ground truth is computed as µ = 10γ2 = 8.1. PQR estimated the target relatively better
compared to QR-DQN as the agent often chooses an alternative action from a risk-neutral per-
spective. Only by chainging from optimism to a randomized scheme, p-DLTV made a much better

the extra point of +100, the agent cannot reach the threshold."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DETAILS,0.36507936507936506,"Figure 4(a) shows that p-DLTV and PQR have reached the threshold 200 points faster than the

criterion from OFU while DLTV did not learn to obtain the extra point. The result shows that one-
sided tendency on risk leads to learning failure of an agent. We note that the randomized risk criterion
could alleviate the stuckness within an affordable time budget."

CONCLUSIONS"
CONCLUSIONS,0.45714285714285713,"In this paper, we proposed a general framework of risk-based exploration which captures the char-
acteristics of a return distribution. Without resorting to a pre-defined risk criterion, we revealed and
resolved the stuckness where one-sided tendency on risk can lead to biased action selection. To
our best knowledge, this paper is the first attempt in DRL to integrate risk-sensitivity and explo-
ration by using time-varying Bellman objective with theoretical analysis. We prove that PDBOO is
theoretically guaranteed for convergence, and has a unique fixed point in a weaker condition than
contraction. By obtaining the same fixed point as the standard Bellman optimality operator, we can
obtain a risk-neutral optimal policy even if the agent explored with distortion risk measure. Our
method shows better empirical results compared to recent exploration methods for distributional RL
with various environments."
