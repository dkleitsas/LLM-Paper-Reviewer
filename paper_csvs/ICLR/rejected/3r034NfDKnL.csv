ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.003952569169960474,"Humans often systematically generalize in situations where standard deep neural
networks do not. Empirical studies have shown that the learning procedure and
network architecture can inﬂuence systematicity in deep networks, but the under-
lying reasons for this inﬂuence remain unclear. Here we theoretically study the
acquisition of systematic knowledge by simple neural networks. We introduce a
minimal space of datasets with systematic and non-systematic features in both the
input and output. For shallow and deep linear networks, we derive learning trajec-
tories for all datasets in this space. The solutions reveal that both shallow and deep
networks rely on non-systematic inputs to the same extent throughout learning,
such that even with early stopping, no networks learn a fully systematic mapping.
Turning to the impact of architecture, we show that modularity improves extrac-
tion of systematic structure, but only achieves perfect systematicity in the trivial
setting where systematic mappings are fully segregated from non-systematic in-
formation. Finally, we analyze iterated learning, a procedure in which generations
of networks learn from languages generated by earlier learners. Here we ﬁnd
that networks with output modularity successfully converge over generations to
a fully systematic ‘language’ starting from any dataset in our space. Our results
contribute to clarifying the role of learning regime, architecture, and dataset struc-
ture in promoting systematic generalization, and provide theoretical support for
empirical observations that iterated learning can improve systematicity."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.011857707509881422,"Humans frequently display the ability to systematically generalize, that is, to leverage speciﬁc learn-
ing experiences in diverse new settings (Lake et al., 2019). For instance, exploiting the approximate
compositionality of natural language, humans can combine a ﬁnite set of words or phonemes into
a near-inﬁnite set of sentences, words, and meanings. Someone who understands “brown dog” and
“black cat” also likely understands “brown cat,” to take one example from Szab´o (2012). The result
is that a human’s ability to reason about situations or phenomena extends far beyond their ability to
directly experience and learn from all such situations or phenomena."
INTRODUCTION,0.015810276679841896,"Deep learning techniques have made great strides in tasks like machine translation and language pre-
diction, providing proof of principle that they can succeed in quasi-compositional domains. How-
ever, these methods are typically data hungry and the same networks often fail to generalize in even
simple settings when training data are scarce (Lake & Baroni, 2018; Lake et al., 2019). Empirically,
the degree of systematicity in deep networks is inﬂuenced by many factors. One possibility is that
the learning dynamics in a deep network could impart an implicit inductive bias toward systematic
structure (Hupkes et al., 2020); however, a number of studies have identiﬁed situations where depth
alone is insufﬁcient for structured generalization (Lake & Baroni, 2018; Niklasson & Sharkey, 1992;
Pollack, 1990; Phillips & Wiles, 1993). Another signiﬁcant factor is architectural modularity, which
can enable a system to generalize when modules are appropriately conﬁgured (Vani et al., 2021;
Phillips, 1995). However, identifying the right modularity through learning remains challenging
(Bahdanau et al., 2019). A third possibility builds on Iterated Learning (IL), a method in which
generations of agents train brieﬂy on a ‘language’ produced by their parent, and then generate a
new language for their child (Kalish et al., 2007). If systematic components are easier to learn"

ture, a process which has been hypothesized to be the cause of the compositional nature of natural
language (Kirby, 2001; Kirby et al., 2008). In spite of these (and many other) possibilities for im-
proving systematicity (Hupkes et al., 2020), it remains unclear when standard deep neural networks
will exhibit systematic generalization (Dankers et al., 2021), reﬂecting a long-standing theoretical
debate stretching back to the ﬁrst wave of connectionist deep networks (Rumelhart & McClelland,
1986; Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988; Smolensky, 1991; 1990; Hadley, 1994)."

BACKGROUND"
BACKGROUND,0.043478260869565216,"Systematic generalization has been proposed as a key feature of intelligent learning agents which
can generalize to novel stimuli in their environment (Hockett & Hockett, 1960; Fodor & Pylyshyn,
1988; Hadley, 1993; Kirby et al., 2015; Lake et al., 2017). In particular, the closely related concept of
compositional structure has been shown to have beneﬁts for both learning speed (Ren et al., 2019)
and generalizability (Lazaridou et al., 2018). There are, however, counter-examples which ﬁnd
only a weak correlation between compositionality and generalization (Andreas, 2018) or learning
speed (Kharitonov & Baroni, 2020). In most cases neural networks do not manage to generalize
systematically (Ruis et al., 2020), or systematic generalization occurs only with the addition of
modular architectures, explicit regularizers or a degree of supervision of the learned features."
BACKGROUND,0.04743083003952569,"Neural Module Networks (NMNs) (Andreas et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2017; 2018) have become one
successful method of creating network architectures which generalize systematically. By (jointly)
training individual neural modules on particular subsets of data or to perform particular subtasks,
the modules will specialize. These modules can then be combined in new ways when an unseen
datapoint is input to the model. Thus, through the composition of the modules, the model will
systematically generalize, assuming that the correct modules can be structured together. Bahdanau
et al. (2019) show, however, that strong regularizers are required for the correct module structures to
be learned. Thus, without regularizers, compositional mappings do not emerge with NMNs."
BACKGROUND,0.05138339920948617,"Iterated learning (IL) approaches suggest that systematicity can emerge over generations of agents
that learn from each other. In some works, based primarily on the topological structure of language
(Brighton & Kirby, 2006), compositional structure does emerge from IL (Ren et al., 2019). When
paired with NMNs, IL has previously been used to reﬁne the module structures to be compositional
(Vani et al., 2021) by treating the module structure as an output “language”. Then each “word”
in the language represents a particular module composed to form a “sentence” which describes the
model architecture (the relative arrangement of the modules in Polish notation). Thus, by phrasing
the problem as a language learning task, IL is able to reﬁne this language of architectures to become
modular. This work also highlights the fact that IL is applicable outside of traditional language
learning tasks."

various input features, mapping these to output features or “words” in order to refer to the item

tematic (Ω) and non-systematic (Γ) features in the input (left panel) and output (middle panel). Rows
contain examples and columns contain features. In this case cars are named with both a systematic
component (based on features: presence of stripe, colour and number of doors) and non-systematic
component (based on brand). In iterated learning, the names of objects change from the initial labels
over generations until they stabilize at the reﬁned ﬁnal labels (right panel, ˆΩy, ˆΓy)."
BACKGROUND,0.07114624505928854,"IL has also been successfully used with NNs as part of a larger pipeline. In particular Seeded Iterated
Learning (SIL) (Lu et al., 2020a) uses IL to counter language drift. Language drift occurs when a
pretrained language model is then used to complete a language based task. While training on the
task, the model begins to lose structure in the learned language that is not useful for performing the
task. By training a “teacher” model on task completion and then using the teacher to supervise a
pretrained “student”, Lu et al. (2020a) show that the student network is able to learn to complete
the task while maintaining the initially learned language. SIL is extended by Lu et al. (2020b)
to include supervised selfplay in the teacher task-learning step. This is known as Supervised SIL
(SSIL). Thus, parts of the data used to pretrain the teacher are also replayed while the teacher learns
to perform the task. This also aids in avoiding language drift. While these previous works reﬂect the
inﬂuence of certain initial data properties, regularizers or complex architectures on the emergence
of compositional structure, the necessity of structured architectures with modular designs remains
unclear."

(Fig. 1a), extracting various perceptual input features such as whether it has a stripe, is red, or has
a particular hood ornament. This scenario affords several ways in which we could refer to the car.

individual output features. More generally, an agent ﬁrst observes an object and forms an internal
“logical form”. The task is then to map from this logical form to a “phonetic form” by providing a
name for each object (Brighton & Kirby, 2006). As illustrated in this example, real world settings
often allow redundant expressions and mappings, such that the same object could be individuated
with a variety of expressions that vary in systematicity."
A SPACE OF DATASETS WITH COMBINATORIAL SYSTEMATICITY,0.09090909090909091,"To formalize this setting, we deﬁne a parametric space of datasets with input and output matrices
X = [Ωx Γx]T and Y = [Ωy Γy]T respectively, where nx, ny, kx, ky, r ∈R+ are the parameters
that deﬁne a speciﬁc dataset. Figure 1b visualizes one dataset in the space. The systematic input
feature matrix Ωx ∈{−1, 1}nx×2nx consists of all binary patterns with nx bits. Here nx is a key
parameter determining the number of bits in the systematic input structure. Overall, the dataset con-
tains 2nx examples. The systematic output feature matrix Ωy ∈{−1, 1}ny×2nx is a sampling of ny
features (rows) from Ωx, and is the systematic component of the output matrix. Intuitively, the binary
combinatorial structure in Ωx and Ωy is meant to reﬂect systematic mappings from input features
(the color red or blue) to output features (the words “red” or “blue”). Next, the non-systematic input
feature matrix Γx = [rI1 ... rIkx] consists of kx scaled identity matrices, Ii ∈{0, 1}2nx×2nx. Simi-
larly, the non-systematic output matrix Γy = [rI1 ... rIky] has ky scaled identity matrices, with scale
factor r. These identity matrices provide a single feature for each pattern which is only on for that
pattern. Intuitively, these features are meant to reﬂect idiosyncratic features (like hood ornament, a
distinctive scratch, or a proper noun name) or features reﬂecting speciﬁc nonlinear combinations of
systematic features (red-striped-2-door). Together kx, ky and r control the frequency and intensity
(for example the size or perceptual prominence of the brand’s logo) of the non-systematic features,
which are both factors that can promote non-compositional language being used by humans (Rogers
et al., 2004)."
A SPACE OF DATASETS WITH COMBINATORIAL SYSTEMATICITY,0.09486166007905138,"This space of datasets is consistent with numerical notions of compositionality in previous works
(Andreas, 2018), which deﬁne compositionality as a homomorphism between the observation space
and the naming space (since the input-output mappings are linear they are homomorphic). The
amount of systematic structure can be titrated by adjusting nx and ny; and the prevalence of non-
systematic structure by adjusting kx, ky, and r. Importantly, and novel to our analysis, datasets
in this space allow redundant solutions: the systematic output features can be generated based on
systematic input features alone, but they can equally be generated using non-systematic features
alone, or some mixture of the two. Exploiting this fact, we now ask how reliance on systematic or
non-systematic structure is inﬂuenced by implicit biases, architecture, and learning regime."

architecture, initialization, and dataset statistics. In this section we ask how the implicit inductive
bias in gradient descent inﬂuences systematicity. We consider training both shallow and deep linear
networks on datasets in our space. While deep linear networks can only represent linear input-output
mappings, the dynamics of learning change dramatically with the introduction of one or more hidden
layers (Fukumizu, 1998; Saxe et al., 2014; 2019; Arora et al., 2018; Lampinen & Ganguli, 2019),
and the learning problem becomes non-convex (Baldi & Hornik, 1989). They therefore serve as a

norms of the mappings to non-systematic outputs. Lastly, λ3 occurs because of the non-systematic

MODULARITY AND NETWORK ARCHITECTURE,0.2766798418972332,"We now turn to modularity and network architecture, another prominent approach for promoting
systematicity in a network’s mapping (Vani et al., 2021; Bahdanau et al., 2019). Architectures
such as Neural Module Networks (Andreas et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2017; 2018) learn reconﬁgurable
modules that implement speciﬁc aspects of a larger problem. By rearranging existing modules to
process a novel input, they can generalize far beyond their training set. Here we investigate whether
simple forms of additional architectural structure can yield strong enough inductive biases to learn
fully systematic mappings."
MODULARITY AND NETWORK ARCHITECTURE,0.28063241106719367,"In particular, instead of a dense network, we consider architectures in which systematic and non-
systematic features are processed in separate processing streams, as depicted in Figure 3. The learn-
ing dynamics for several of these different settings can be obtained by combining the dynamics of
other points in the space of datasets. To illustrate the approach, consider the output-partitioned net-
work. The pathway leading to the systematic outputs effectively learns from a dataset with ky = 0,
and the pathway leading to the non-systematic outputs effectively learns from a dataset with ny = 0.
By combining these dynamics, we can reconstruct the full solution, as shown in Figure 8 of Ap-
pendix E. We note that this approach cannot be taken for the input partitioned network, which has
interactions in the output layer. We summarize our ﬁndings with the graphical representations of
the network mappings in Figure 3. The same three modes drive learning dynamics, but they contain
subtly different mixtures of contributions from systematic and non-systematic inputs and outputs.
Notably, the output-partitioned network exhibits output systematicity but not input systematicity,
a signiﬁcant point that we will return to in the iterated learning section. However, only the fully
partitioned network achieves full systematicity, such that early stopping could completely prune
non-systematic features. Hence we ﬁnd that architectural biases can enforce systematicity, but only
in the heavy-handed and relatively trivial case where the bias perfectly segregates systematic and
non-systematic information."

Dashed line shows the best early-stopping can achieve for the starting dataset (stopping at epoch
30 with the output-split network). Even though the networks are run for 40 epochs per generation,
IL is still able to out-perform early stopping with the output-split network. It is important to note
that the dense and split networks maintain the original systematic mapping by epoch 40, and these
results show the closest each network can get to removing the non-systematic component under
this restriction. The shallow network is unable to fully maintain the systematic mapping with any
form of IL, thus the decrease in its norm is at the expense of the systematic mapping. Parameters:
nx = 3, ny = 2, kx = 1, ky = 1 and r = 2."

ITERATED LEARNING"
ITERATED LEARNING,0.30039525691699603,"Finally, we consider the impact of iterated learning on extracting systematic structure, alongside
architectural partitioning. In iterated learning, the focus is on reﬁning the output ‘language’ toward
systematicity over generations of learners (Kirby, 2001; Kalish et al., 2007), as illustrated in Figure
1b middle and right panel. Each generation learns from the language acquired by the previous
generation (Figure 4a). To instantiate this setting, we start from a particular dataset in our space,
but halt training before full convergence after a pre-deﬁned number of training steps. We then use
the network’s output (logits) as the target outputs for the next generation. Throughout learning, the
network’s input-output mapping takes the same form as the dataset’s singular value decomposition,
but with different singular values. Therefore, the generated language always has the same singular
vectors, but with different singular values corresponding to the amount of learning progress made by
a given agent. This fact permits straightforward analysis of iterated learning dynamics throughout
our space of datasets."
ITERATED LEARNING,0.30434782608695654,"Figure 4b depicts the reﬁnement of the output language over generations in networks with differ-
ent architectures. In particular, iterated learning is effective in reducing or eliminating the non-
systematic output features, and can do so more effectively than carefully chosen early-stopping on
the original dataset. We make several observations. First, while deep and shallow networks do not
learn perfectly systematic mappings in the ﬁrst generation, the deep network does learn a relatively
more systematic mapping, such that IL yields more rapid beneﬁts. Second, iterated learning in dense
networks can reduce non-systematic structure relative to early stopping, but does not eliminate it.
Third, and most notably, iterated learning can exploit weak architectural priors: with optimal early
stopping, the output partitioned network does not fully remove non-systematic output features, but
over generations of iterated learning it completely eliminates non-systematic output structure."
ITERATED LEARNING,0.308300395256917,"This effect arises because the systematic and non-systematic mappings depend on entirely different
modes. Since π1 is used by the systematic mapping and is learned the fastest for the space of datasets,
in fact IL in the output-partitioned network completely removes the non-systematic mapping for any
dataset in the space of datasets. Whereas early-stopping has varying performance over the space of
datasets, IL with the output-split network will always be able to converge to a systematic language"

COMPOSITIONAL MNIST (CMNIST)"
ITERATED LEARNING,0.33201581027667987,"To evaluate how well our results generalize to non-linear networks and more complex datasets, in
this section we train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn a compositional variant
of MNIST (CMNIST). In this dataset three digits from MNIST are stacked horizontally, resulting in
a value between 0 and 999. The systematic output encodes each digit in a 10-way one-hot vector,
resulting in a 30-dimensional vector. The non-systematic output encodes the number as a whole
with a 1000-dimensional one-hot vector. This task is similar to the SVHN dataset (Netzer et al.,
2011) with systematic and non-systematic output labels."
ITERATED LEARNING,0.3359683794466403,"We compare results of using a single dense CNN and a split CNN, in which two parallel sets of
convolutional layers with half the convolutional ﬁlters of the dense network each that connect sep-
arately to systematic and non-systematic labels. Full details of the two network architectures and
hyper-parameters used for the CMNIST experiments are given in Appendix G. The effect predicted
by our theoretical work is that the redundancy in the labels will interfere with the network’s learned
hidden representations and decrease the systematic generalizability of the network. This predic-
tion is shown to be true in Figure 5, which shows the mean-squared error for the systematic and
non-systematic network predictions over the course of training, normalized so that the initial error
is at 1.0. Firstly, in dense networks the error of the systematic mapping is tied to the error of the
non-systematic mapping. This is seen in Figure 5(a) where the blue curve cannot converge until
the orange curve has become sufﬁciently low. This effect is not observed with the split network.
Secondly, comparing Figure 5(a) and 5(b) we demonstrate the lack of generalization which occurs
when using non-systematic features. This is seen as the orange and red curves achieving a lower
training error while the test error increases. Lastly, again by comparing Figure 5(a) and 5(b), we
see that the systematic mapping of the split architecture is the only mapping which generalizes well
(near 0 training and test error). Thus, even in this more complex setting, we see the negative effect a
shared hidden layer has on the generalization of the network (comparing the blue and green curves)."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.3438735177865613,"In this work we have theoretically and empirically studied the ability of simple NNs to acquire sys-
tematic knowledge. We found that this ability is challenging even in our simple setting. Neither
implicit biases in learning dynamics, nor all but the most stringent modularity, caused networks to
ignore non-systematic inputs. However, iterated learning–when combined with weaker architectural
priors–can converge to strongly systematic output features. Our results complement recent empir-
ical studies, helping to highlight the complex factors inﬂuencing systematic generalization. We
hope greater understanding of these phenomena will ultimately aid the design of improved learning
systems that can leverage speciﬁc learning in diverse new ways."

work has at least 2nx hidden neurons (the number of singular values in the input-output covariance
matrix) so that it can learn the desired mapping perfectly. If this is not the case then the model will
learn the top nh singular values of the input-output mapping where nh is the number of hidden neu-
rons (Saxe et al., 2014). Given the SVDs of the two correlation matrices the learning dynamics can

CMNIST ARCHITECTURE AND HYPER-PARAMETERS"
NX,0.9525691699604744,"In this section we provide the network architectures for the CMNIST experiments as well as
other details of the experimental setup.
We scale the non-systematic output labels to help the
network learn these labels. For the results of this section a scale of 10 was applied, however, the
results are consistent for a wide range of scale values. Increasing or decreasing the scale merely
changes the time taken for the same effects to occur. Both the dense and split networks are trained
using stochastic gradient descent from random initial weights sampled from an isotropic normal
distribution. No regularization, learning rate decay or momentum is used. We aim to keep the
setup as simple as possible while reducing the effects of other implicit or explicit regularizers on
the results, since we are comparing the systematic generalization of the networks. The simplicity
also aids the comparison between the dense and split network architectures which is the goal of
the experiment. Table 1 shows the hyper-parameters used to train both networks, which have the
same hyper-parameters, and the two architectures are shown in Figures 9 (dense architecture) and
10 (split architecture)."

NX,0.9723320158102767,"We describe some further observations. Consistent with results in linear networks, when training
a dense network there is a portion of the systematic mapping which is learned at the same time as
the non-systematic mapping (particularly from around epoch 150). In contrast, when using a split
architecture the systematic mapping is learned independently of the non-systematic mapping and
faster, while the non-systematic mapping struggles to learn. The non-systematic mapping fails to
reach a near-zero error and plateaus around 0.4 regardless of how long training lasts. Thus, without a
systematic mapping sharing the same hidden layer and helping learning, the non-systematic mapping
is ineffective even at ﬁtting the training data in a reasonable amount of time."
NX,0.9762845849802372,"Turning to Figure 5b, we see that for both the dense and split networks the non-systematic mapping
does not generalize to test data. This is to be expected as it is unlikely that the same numbers in
the training data would ever appear in the test data. Notably, comparing the systematic mappings
we see that the converged dense network generalizes far worse than the converged split network.
It is interesting to note that initially both networks generalize equally well, indicating the potential
for IL to be partially effective for a dense network. However, in agreement with our theoretical
ﬁndings, IL on the dense network would not come without a cost since the network is not able to
fully learn the systematic mapping while still maintaining a low generalization error. Since the ﬁnal
portion of the systematic mapping is learned at the same time as the non-systematic mapping, the
earliest epoch during training when IL can fully preserve the systematic labels will already have
learned some of the non-systematic mapping. However, by learning the non-systematic mapping"

architecture is that it avoids the conﬂict in its hidden layers from learning to accommodate both the
systematic and non-systematic mappings."
