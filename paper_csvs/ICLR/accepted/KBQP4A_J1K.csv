ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0013123359580052493,"Despite progress across a broad range of applications, Transformers have limited
success in systematic generalization. The situation is especially frustrating in the
case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to ﬁnd intuitive solutions that route
relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid repre-
sented by Transformer columns. To facilitate the learning of useful control ﬂow, we
propose two modiﬁcations to the Transformer architecture, copy gate and geometric
attention. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generaliza-
tion accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect
accuracy on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for
generalization across computational depths. NDR’s attention and gating patterns
tend to be interpretable as an intuitive form of neural routing. Our code is public.1"

INTRODUCTION,0.003937007874015748,"Neural networks (NNs) may easily learn certain training sets, but typically they do not generalize on
systematically different test sets. Examples of systematic generalization (Fodor et al., 1988)"
INTRODUCTION,0.005249343832020997,"include generalization to sequences longer than those seen during training—productivity, and algo-
rithmic combinations of previously learned rules—systematicity. Despite recent efforts (Bahdanau
et al., 2019; Korrel et al., 2019; Lake, 2019; Li et al., 2019; Russin et al., 2019; Csord´as et al.,
2021), systematic generalization generally remains unsolved (Fodor & McLaughlin, 1990; Lake &
Baroni, 2018; Liska et al., 2018; Greff et al., 2020; Hupkes et al., 2020). On some datasets, the best
performing models are neuro-symbolic hybrids (Chen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) using task-speciﬁc
symbolic functions. However, their applicability to other datasets remains limited (Furrer et al., 2020;
Shaw et al., 2020). A big question is: which type of architectural inductive bias encourages the
training process to select “good” solutions which generalize systematically?"
INTRODUCTION,0.006561679790026247,"The popular Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) also often fail to generalize on algorithmic tasks
(e.g. Liska et al. (2018); Dubois et al. (2020); Chaabouni et al. (2021); Csord´as et al. (2021);
Onta˜n´on et al. (2021)), even on tasks with intuitive solutions that can be simply expressed in terms of
Transformer attention patterns. Given an input sequence of length N and a Transformer encoder of
depth T, solving an algorithmic task is often all about routing the relevant information to the right
node/operation at the right time in the T-by-N grid represented by Transformer columns (illustrated
in Figure 1/Left). Effectively the task is to learn to draw an adaptive control ﬂow on the canvas
of Transformer columns. In fact, recent work by Weiss et al. (2021) introduced a programming
language called RASP, which is speciﬁcally designed to express solutions to sequence processing
problems, and which has a direct equivalent to the operations in Transformer encoders. However, it is
shown that Transformers learn solutions expressed in RASP only through intermediate supervision of
attention patterns, and sometimes, even such supervision fails. Generally speaking, Transformers fail
to ﬁnd easily interpretable and/or symbolic solutions to algorithmic tasks. We conversely hypothesize
that attention-based NNs that are able to ﬁnd intuitive solutions (achieving interpretable attention
patterns) could improve systematic generalization."

INTRODUCTION,0.010498687664041995,"Here we point out that regular Transformers lack some basic ingredients for learning such “intuitive”
solutions to algorithmic problems. As a remedy, we propose simple architectural modiﬁcations to
help them learn data routing. As a ﬁrst step towards validating our model, we focus on the popular
length generalization task of compositional table lookup (CTL; Liska et al. (2018); Hupkes et al.
(2019); Dubois et al. (2020)), as well as two more complex tasks: a simple arithmetic task and a
variant of ListOps (Nangia & Bowman, 2018) designed to test the compositional generalization
ability of NNs. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% generalization accuracy (never
reported before; Dubois et al. (2020)) on the CTL task, and obtains nearly perfect accuracy on both
the proposed simple arithmetic and ListOps tasks. We show that the attention and gating patterns of
NDR tend to be interpretable as plausible control ﬂows."

IMPROVING TRANSFORMERS FOR LEARNING ADAPTIVE CONTROL FLOW"
IMPROVING TRANSFORMERS FOR LEARNING ADAPTIVE CONTROL FLOW,0.013123359580052493,"We argue that the following components are needed to build Transformers capable of learning adaptive
control ﬂow. First, composing known operations in an arbitrary order requires that all operations
are available at every computational step. This can be easily achieved by sharing the weights of the
layers, as is done in Universal Transformers (Dehghani et al., 2019). Second, the network should be
sufﬁciently deep, at least as deep as the deepest data dependency in the computational graph built
from elementary operations (e.g., in the case of a parse tree, this is the depth of the tree). Otherwise,
multiple operations must be fused into a single layer and hinder natural and elegant compositions.
Third, inputs in some columns should be kept unchanged until it is their turn to be processed. The
regular Transformer lacks a mechanism for skipping the whole transformation step by simply copying
the input to the next step/layer. We propose a special gating function, copy gate, to implement such a
mechanism (Sec. 2.1). Finally, many algorithmic tasks require combining several local computations
in the right order. This typically implies that attention should not focus on all possible matches at a
given time but only on the closest match. We propose and investigate a new type of attention with a
corresponding inductive bias called geometric attention (Sec. 2.2). Using both the geometric attention
and copy gate, our model implements a “neural data routing mechanism”, which can adaptively
serialize the input problem. We refer to the resulting new Transformer as Neural Data Router (NDR).
In the experimental section (Sec. 3), we evaluate this model on three algorithmic tasks requiring
length generalization and demonstrate its effectiveness."

COPY GATE: LEARNING TO SKIP OPERATIONS (VERTICAL FLOW)"
IMPROVING TRANSFORMERS FOR LEARNING ADAPTIVE CONTROL FLOW,0.015748031496062992,"Each layer of the regular Transformer consists of one self-attention and one feedforward block.
The input to each of these blocks is directly connected to the corresponding output via a residual
connection (Srivastava et al., 2015; He et al., 2016). However, such a connection does not allow for
skipping the transformation of the entire layer and simply passing the unchanged input to the next
layer. Here we propose to add an explicit gate, which we call copy gate, to facilitate such a behavior."

each column depends on the states of all columns. This is a crucial difference compared to previously
proposed gatings in Transformers, which are solely motivated by training stability (Parisotto et al.,

COMPOSITIONAL TABLE LOOKUP,0.06824146981627296,"Task.
The compositional table lookup task (Liska et al., 2018; Hupkes et al., 2019; Dubois et al.,
2020) is constructed based on a set of symbols and unary functions deﬁned over these symbols. Each
example in the task is deﬁned by one input symbol and a list of functions to be applied sequentially,
i.e., the ﬁrst function is applied to the input symbol and the resulting output becomes the input to
the second function, and so forth. There are eight possible symbols. Each symbol is traditionally
represented by a 3-bit bitstring (Liska et al., 2018). However, in practice, they are simply processed
as one token (Dubois et al., 2020). The functions are bijective and randomly generated. Each function
is represented by a letter. An example input is ‘101 d a b’, which corresponds to the expression
b(a(d(101))); the model has to predict the correct output symbol. We note that there exists a sequence-
to-sequence variant of this task (Dubois et al., 2020) where the model has to predict all intermediate
steps (thus trained with intermediate supervision). We directly predict the ﬁnal output. An ideal
model should be able to solve this task independently of the presentation order, that is, it should
not matter whether the task is encoded as ‘101 d a b’ or ‘b a d 101’. We thus study both
forward (former) and backward (latter) variants of the task. To evaluate systematic generalization, the
train/valid/test sets reﬂect different numbers of compositions: samples with 1-5/6-8/9-10 operations,
respectively. To best of our knowledge, no previous work has reported perfect accuracy on this task
through an NN. We refer the readers to Sec. 6 for further details on the previous work."

2019), Universal Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dehghani et al., 2019), and its relative position
variants (Csord´as et al., 2021). For Transformers, the prediction is based on the last column in the
ﬁnal layer (we conduct an ablation study on this choice in Appendix A). The hyper-parameters used
for each model can be found in Table 7 in the appendix. We also provide an ablation study on the
number of layers needed for generalization in Appendix A, which supports our claim on the necessity"

and DNC perform well in the forward variant, achieving perfect generalization for longer sequences,
but fail on the backward variant. This is not surprising since in the forward case, input symbols are
presented in the “right” processing order to the LSTM. As expected, the bidirectional LSTM performs
well in both presentation orders, since one of its processing directions is always aligned with the order
of computation. However, for an arbitrary task, the order of processing is not given. For example,
for ListOps (Sec. 3.3), the processing should start from the deepest point in the parse tree, which is
probably somewhere in the middle of the sequence. The experiments on other tasks (Sec. 3.2 and
3.3) requiring arbitrary processing orders show that bidirectional LSTMs do not generalize well in
such tasks. This is not satisfactory since our goal is to create a generic architecture which can solve
arbitrary problems with an arbitrary underlying input processing order. While the Transformer seems
to be a good candidate for learning problem dependent processing orders, the baseline Transformer
variants fail to generalize in this task in both directions."
COMPOSITIONAL TABLE LOOKUP,0.07349081364829396,"By introducing the copy gate (Sec. 2.1), the relative Transformer can solve the forward task, but
not the backward one. Our analysis showed that the network learns to attend to the last operation
based on the relative position information. Since the result is read from the last column, this position
changes with the sequence length. The model thus fails to generalize to such arbitrary offsets. To
address this issue, we introduce a simple mechanism to let the model choose between absolute and
relative positional encodings at each position (see Appendix B). The resulting model effectively
manages to use the absolute position for the prediction and perform well in both directions. However,
such a combination of absolute/relative positional encoding might be an overly speciﬁc bias. A more
generic solution, geometric attention (Sec. 2.2), also achieved perfect generalization and was found
easier to train. We present the corresponding visualization of our model in Sec. 4."

a popular task commonly used to evaluate parsing abilities of NNs (Havrylov et al., 2019; Shen

as Chowdhury & Caragea (2021) can almost perfectly generalize to longer sequences on this task.
However, as far as we know, no Transformer variant has been reported to be fully successful."
LISTOPS,0.09711286089238845,"Task.
The task consists of executing nested list operations written in preﬁx notation. All operations
have a list of arguments that can be either a digit (from 0 to 9) or recursively another operation with
its own list of arguments. The operations are min, max, median and sum. The sum is modulo 10, and
the median is followed by the ﬂoor function such that the output of any operation lies between 0 and
9. For example: [MED 4 8 5 [MAX 8 4 9 ] ] should return 6. There are two well-known
variants: the original one by Nangia & Bowman (2018) and the “Long Range Arena” variant by Tay
et al. (2021) which have different maximum numbers of arguments in each function and maximum
sequence lengths. In both variants, there is no strict control of the depth of data samples: there is
simply a certain pre-deﬁned probability that each argument in the list is expanded into another list
(which may increase the tree depth). This is not suitable for evaluating systematic generalization in
terms of compositionality (over the problem depth). We propose instead to generate clean train, valid,
and test splits with disjoint depths: up to depth 5 for training, depth 6 for validation and depths 7
and 8 for test. Importantly, we make sure that a depth-K sample effectively requires computation
until depth-K (otherwise min, max, and med operations could potentially ﬁnd the output without
executing all of its arguments). By dissociating the splits by the depth, we can clearly identify models
which fail to generalize compositionally. Apart from the depth speciﬁcations, all train/valid/test sets
share the same settings as follows: the maximum sequence length is 50 (tokens), the probability of
recursively sampling another function inside a list is 30% at each position, and the maximum number
of arguments for a function is 5. The train set consists of 1M, the valid and test sets of 1K sequences."

We can also identify how the NDR processes the data in ListOps. Different attention
heads play different roles. We highlight the core observations in Figure 3. The input for this ex-
ample is: [SM [MED [MIN 1 7 4 [MAX 2 4 0 8 9 ] ] 7 ] 5 [MED 8 5 8 ] 0
7 ]. First of all, we ﬁnd that there is a head (head 13 in Figure 3, ﬁrst row) which seems to be
responsible for connecting operators and their arguments: the operands/arguments of an operation at-
tend to the operator. In step 0 (t = 0 in the ﬁgure), we can recognize that the operations at the deepest
level, namely MAX and the second MED have all the arguments ready (as is shown by vertical lines on
the columns corresponding to MAX and MED). The model indeed identiﬁes that these two operations
are ready to be executed and that they can be processed in parallel (these arguments-to-operation
attention patterns remain for a few steps). We note that at this stage, the last argument of MIN is not
ready yet ([MIN 1 7 4 [MAX 2 4 0 8 9 ] ]). We can see that only arguments which are
already ready (1 7 4) attend to the operator (see the column of MIN). In step 1 (t = 1, 2nd row), we
can see that head 5 copies the expected result of MAX, 9 to the column of the operator (we note that
this only requires one step as 9 is always the result of MAX when it is one of the arguments of MAX).
Similarly in step 2, head 7 (2nd row) seems to copy the result of the second MED, 8 to the operator
column. In step 3 (t = 3, 1st row), we recognize that the result of MAX is marked as an argument for
MIN in head 13 which is responsible for communication between operators and their arguments. This
is shown by the new attention which appears at t = 3 in head 13 from the source position MAX to the
target position MIN (a pattern which is not visible at t = 2). In head 3, t = 6 (2nd row), the expected
result of MIN, which is 1, is copied to the operator, similarly to the patterns we observed above for
MAX and MED. In head 13, t = 6 (1st row), all arguments for the ﬁrst MED are now also recognized
(the result of MIN which is 1, and 7). Finally in t = 7 (2nd row), two heads, head 3 and head 5 seem
to copy/gather two inputs needed to compute the corresponding median, 1 and 7, and store them in"

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.1942257217847769,"Learning adaptive serialization.
The NDR architecture can be understood as performing adaptive
serialization of the problem. A key requirement for reusable computation is decomposing the
problem into reusable building blocks, typically applied in sequential steps. The granularity of the
decomposition determines the degree of reusability: fusing operations in a single step makes the
processing faster (fewer steps), but also more specialized. Learning the most granular solutions
is thus preferable for generalization. At the same time, not all processing should happen serially:
branches of the computational graph that do not have common data dependencies can be processed
independently in parallel, which we empirically observe in our NDR in the ListOps example (Sec. 4).
This enables the architecture to get away with a number of computational steps reﬂecting the depth
of the computational graph rather than the length of the input."
DISCUSSION,0.19553805774278216,"Bottom up approach for improving model architectures.
Transformers have seen tremendous
successes across various application domains (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy
et al., 2021). Impressive results have been reported when they are scaled up with a large amount of
data (Brown et al., 2020). On the other hand, simple tasks like those highlighted in the present work
demonstrate that the Transformer architecture still struggles with basic reasoning. Particularly in
algorithmic tasks, it is often the case that a sub-optimal choice of architecture/optimization method
makes the model fall back to simple memorization. We argue that it is crucial to look at isolated
problems which test speciﬁc generalization capability. This calls for a bottom-up approach: building
on toy tasks that focus on individual aspects of generalization and using them for improving models."

RELATED WORK,0.1994750656167979,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
RELATED WORK,0.20078740157480315,"is different from those as it satisﬁes two important properties. First, our copy gate allows the model
to skip the entire Transformer layer (i.e., both the self-attention and the feedforward blocks) when the
gate is closed. Second, the gate function is conditioned on the attention output such that the decision
of opening or closing depends on information from all columns. While multiple gating variants have
been proposed by Parisotto et al. (2020) to stabilize Transformers for reinforcement learning, none of
them can produce this behavior. Empirically, we also tried out a few other gating variants which do
not satisfy the two properties above; we found them not to improve over regular Transformers in our
preliminary experiments on compositional table lookup. Recent work by Chaabouni et al. (2021) also
makes use of “gating” in Transformers through a gated linear unit (GLU) activation function com-
monly used in convolutional NNs (Dauphin et al., 2017). Transformer models with such an activation
function were reported to outperform RNN baselines on a systematic generalization task (Dess`ı &
Baroni, 2019). Unlike our copy gate or Parisotto et al. (2020)’s gating, such a gating activation does
not have the “residual” term (i.e. a closed gate zeros out the input) which allows the model to skip
a transformation. In a more general context, beneﬁts of the GLU activation in Transformers vary
across tasks (Irie et al., 2019; Shazeer, 2020). In language modeling, no improvement is typically
obtained by using the standard highway gate instead of the residual connection in Transformers (Irie,
2020), while it yields improvements when combined with convolutional layers (Kim & Rush, 2016)."
RELATED WORK,0.2020997375328084,"Parameterized geometric distributions.
Two recent works (Brooks et al., 2021; Banino et al.,
2021) have used a form of parameterized geometric distribution (PGD; in the form of Eq. 7). Brooks
et al. (2021) have used such a distribution to parameterize the movement of a pointer on a sequence of
instructions. Banino et al. (2021) have used it to implement adaptive computation time (Schmidhuber,
2012; Graves, 2016). We use the PGD to obtain a generic attention mechanism as a replacement of
the standard self-attention used in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017)."
RELATED WORK,0.20341207349081364,"Compositional table lookup.
CTL task was proposed for evaluating the compositional ability of
NNs (Liska et al., 2018). Previous works evaluated RNNs, RNNs with attention, and Transformers
on this task with limited success (Hupkes et al., 2019; Dubois et al., 2020). Dubois et al. (2020) have
proposed a special attention mechanism to augment the recurrent architecture. While they obtained
good performance for the forward presentation order, the proposed model failed in the backward one.
In contrast, two of our approaches (Sec. 3.1) achieve 100% generalization accuracy for both orders."
RELATED WORK,0.2047244094488189,"Positional encodings.
Many previous works have focused on improving positional encoding
(Schmidhuber, 1992; Vaswani et al., 2017) for self-attention. Most notably, the relative positional
encoding (Schmidhuber, 1992; Shaw et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019) was found useful for improving
systematic generalization of Transformers (Csord´as et al., 2021). Here we also present two new
approaches related to positional encoding. One is the gated combination of absolute and relative posi-
tional encoding (Sec. 3.1; details in Appendix B). We show that absolute positional encoding can com-
plement relative positional encoding. The former enables the model to always attend to a speciﬁc po-
sition, as is needed for the CTL task in the last step, while the gating allows it to use relative positional
encoding for other positions/steps. Second, we introduce directional encoding to augment geometric
attention. Unlike positional encoding which can overﬁt to a range of positions seen during training, the
direction information is found to be robust and to be a crucial augmentation of the geometric attention."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.2073490813648294,"We proposed a new view on the internal operations of Transformer encoders as a dynamic dataﬂow
architecture between Transformer columns. This overcomes two shortcomings of traditional Trans-
formers: the problem of routing and retaining data in an unaltered fashion, which we solve by an
additional copy gate, and the problem of learning length-independent attention patterns, which we
solve by geometric attention. Our new model, the Neural Data Router (NDR), generalizes to compo-
sitions longer than those seen during training on the popular compositional lookup table task in both
forward and backward directions. NDR also achieves near perfect performance on simple arithmetic
and ListOps tasks in settings that test systematic generalization in terms of computational depth. In
general, the gates and the attention maps collectively make the architecture more interpretable than
the baselines. Future work will extend this encoder-only architecture to a full sequence-to-sequence
model and evaluate it on other standard tasks in systematic generalization requiring generation of
variable-length output sequences."

In Sec. 2, we hypothesized that decomposition of the problem into its elementary
operations is a necessary property of a model which generalizes. This motivated us to conﬁgure our
models to have at least as many layers as the depth of the computation involved, plus a few additional
layers for writing the output and for gathering an overview of the problem at the beginning. We
assumed that in such a model with a sufﬁcient number of layers, each layer learns the underlying
“elementary” operation. The resulting models are thus deeper than those typically used in the
literature for similar tasks (Keysers et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2021). Here we provide an ablation study
to demonstrate that such depths are effectively necessary for generalization. We measure the IID and
generalization performance with various numbers of layers on the compositional table lookup dataset.
Since our test set on the CTL task consists of up to 10 function applications, it should require about
12 layers according to our hypothesis. Table 4 shows the results. We clearly observe that, while the
shallow models can also solve the IID split, only the deep models generalize to the longer problems
(here the 12-layer model generalizes almost perfectly, but the 10-layer one does not)."

position depends on the length of the sequence which might increase the difﬁculty of the problem, in
particular for the models using absolute positional embeddings. Table 5 shows the corresponding
ablation study. We observe that this choice has only marginal impact on the model performance. As a
side note, we also tried the variant where an additional cross-attention layer is used for the readout.
Again, the generalization performance was not better. In fact, these results are not surprising since

In this work, we determined the number of

using Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) to dynamically determine the number of steps. Furthermore,
ACT introduces a form of gating which creates shortcuts in the credit assignment path between the
output and a result of an intermediate layer. This “copying” mechanism resulting from the ACT

the forward direction of the Transformer with relative positional encoding and the one with geometric
attention. However, we were not able to ﬁnd any conﬁguration that generalizes in the backward case.
This demonstrates that the copy gate is effectively a crucial component for generalization which can
not be replaced by ACT. Furthermore, the convergence of models with ACT is signiﬁcantly slower
than those of models with our gating, and they are more unstable and very sensitive to the value of α
on the regularization term, even in the successful forward case. Overall, the only beneﬁt of ACT is
thus the adaptive depth, as is illustrated in Figure 4, which is orthogonal to our study."

CHOOSING THE NUMBER OF LAYERS"
REFERENCES,0.3766404199475066,"In Sec. 2, we hypothesized that one of the conditions for our model to generalize is to be “sufﬁciently”
deep such that elementary operations are learned in separate layers which would then become
composable. In practice, a “sufﬁcient” depth can be determined by the basic units of compositions
implicitly deﬁned by the dataset. The depth of the model must be at least as deep as the deepest
path in the computation graph deﬁned by these basic operations. This hypothesis was empirically
validated in the ablation study presented above (Appendix A). In general, we used the following
heuristics to choose the depth of the Transformers:"

REFERENCES,0.37926509186351703,"Determining the number of steps needed by the elementary operation is not straightforward but it
can be done empirically. For example, for ListOps, as is shown in Sec. 4, it requires two steps per
operation: one step in which the operands attend to the operation, followed by another one where
the result is written back to the operation. For other tasks, we found that a single step per operation
was enough. Choosing more layers than needed is safe, and it can be used to determine the required
number of layers, for example by looking at the gate activity. Finally, “+ a few more layers” are
needed because one additional layer should be used to read out the ﬁnal result, and one or a few more
can be needed for communication between columns (e.g., to determine operator precedence)."

layers and increase the number of computational steps at test time. This allows us to train models

a test set requiring more computational steps. We did this for the ListOps experiment (Sec. 3.3): the
model was trained with 20 layers and tested with 24. Our preliminary experiments conﬁrmed that
this practice has no performance penalty, while it speeds up training."
