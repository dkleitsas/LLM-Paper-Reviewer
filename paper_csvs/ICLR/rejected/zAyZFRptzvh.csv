ABSTRACT,0.004484304932735426,"Auditing trained deep learning (DL) models prior to deployment is vital for prevent-
ing unintended consequences. One of the biggest challenges in auditing is the lack
of human-interpretable specifications for the DL models that are directly useful to
the auditor. We address this challenge through a sequence of semantically-aligned
unit tests, where each unit test verifies whether a predefined specification (e.g.,
accuracy over 95%) is satisfied with respect to controlled and semantically aligned
variations in the input space (e.g., in face recognition, the angle relative to the cam-
era). We enable such unit tests through variations in a semantically-interpretable
latent space of a generative model. Further, we conduct certified training for the
DL model through a shared latent space representation with the generative model.
With evaluations on four different datasets, covering images of chest X-rays, hu-
man faces, ImageNet classes, and towers, we show how AuditAI allows us to
obtain controlled variations for certified training. Thus, our framework, AuditAI,
bridges the gap between semantically-aligned formal verification and scalability.

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.013452914798206279,"Deep learning (DL) models are now ubiquitously deployed in a number of real-world applications,
many of which are safety critical such as autonomous driving and healthcare (Kendall et al., 2019;
Miotto et al., 2018; Senior et al., 2020). As these models are prone to failure, especially under domain
shifts, it is important to know when and how they are likely to fail before their deployment, a process
we refer to as auditing. Inspired by the failure-mode and effects analysis (FMEA) for control systems
and software systems (Teng & Ho, 1996), we propose to audit DL models through a sequence of
semantically-aligned unit tests, where each unit test verifies whether a pre-defined specification (e.g.,
accuracy over 95%) is satisfied with respect to controlled and semantically meaningful variations in
the input space (e.g., the angle relative to the camera for a face image). Being semantically-aligned is
critical for these unit tests to be useful for the auditor of the system to plan the model’s deployment."
INTRODUCTION,0.017937219730941704,"The main challenge for auditing DL models through semantically-aligned unit tests is that the current
large-scale DL models mostly lack an interpretable structure. This makes it difficult to quantify
how the output varies given controlled semantically-aligned input variations. While there are works
that aim to bring interpretable formal verification to DL models (Henriksen & Lomuscio, 2020; Liu
et al., 2019), the scale is still far from the millions if not billions of parameters used in contemporary
models (He et al., 2016; Iandola et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.02242152466367713,"On the other hand, auditing has taken the form of verified adversarial robustness for DL mod-
els (Samangouei et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2018a; Cohen et al., 2019). However, this has mostly
focused on adversarial perturbations in the pixel space, for example, through Interval Bound Propaga-
tion (IBP), where the output is guaranteed to be invariant to input pixel perturbations with respect to
Lp norm (Gowal et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019b). While these approaches are much more scalable
to modern DL architectures, the pixel space variations are not semantically-aligned, meaning they do
not directly relate to semantic changes in the image, unlike in formal verification. Consider a unit test
that verifies against the angle relative to the camera for a face image. A small variation in the angle
(e.g., facing directly at the camera versus 5◦to the left) can induce a large variation in the pixel space.
Current certified training methods are far from being able to provide guarantees with respect to such
large variations in the pixel space with reasonable accuracy."
INTRODUCTION,0.026905829596412557,"Figure 1: Basic outline of AuditAI. The training phase involves the design and training of the algorithms for
a particular use case. The auditor lists a set of specifications that the trained model must satisfy. The auditor
receives the trained model from the designer and with the set of specifications has to determine whether the
model satisfies the specifications. If they are not satisfied, then the model is sent back to the designer for further
updates. After that, the model is deployed, with a model spec-sheet detailing the verified range of operation. At
deployment, latent embeddings of the input inform whether the input is within model-specifications. Based on
the spec-sheet, it can be decided in which settings to use the model."
INTRODUCTION,0.03139013452914798,"Our Approach. In order to overcome the above limitations, we develop a framework for auditing,
AuditAI. We consider a typical machine learning production pipeline (Fig. 1) with three stages, the
design and training of the model, its verification, and finally deployment. The verification is crucial
in determining whether the model satisfies the necessary specifications before deployment."
INTRODUCTION,0.03587443946188341,"We address the gap between scalability and interpretability by proposing to verify specifications for
variations directly in a semantically-aligned latent space of a generative model. For example in Fig. 1,
unit test 1 verifies whether a given face classification model maintains over 95% accuracy when the
face angle is within d◦, while unit test 2 checks under what lighting condition the model has over
86% accuracy. Once the verification is done, the auditor can then use the verified specification to
determine whether to use the trained DL model during deployment."
INTRODUCTION,0.04035874439461883,"For semantically-aligned latent variations, we create a bridge between the generative model and
the DL model such that they share the same latent space. We incorporate a variant of IBP (Zhang
et al., 2019b) for verification with respect to perturbations in the latent space. Further this leads to
a tighter and a much more practical bound in the output space compared to pixel-based certified
training. We also show that AuditAI can verify whether a unit test is satisfied by generating a proof
for verification based on bound propagation. Fig. 1 gives an overview of our auditing framework and
Fig. 2 elaborates on the generative model bridge."
INTRODUCTION,0.04484304932735426,Summary of Contributions:
INTRODUCTION,0.04932735426008968,"1. We develop a framework, AuditAI for auditing deep learning models by creating a bridge with
a generative model such that they share the same semantically-aligned latent space.
2. We propose unit tests as a semantically-aligned way to quantify specifications that can be audited.
3. We show how IBP can be applied to latent space variations, to provide certifications of semantically-
aligned specifications."
INTRODUCTION,0.053811659192825115,"We show that AuditAI is applicable to training, verification, and deployment across diverse datasets:
ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), Chest X-Rays (Irvin et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017), LSUN (Yu et al.,
2015), and Flicker Faces HQ (FFHQ) (Karras et al., 2019). For ImageNet, we show that AuditAI
can train verifiably robust models which can tolerate 25% larger pixel-space variations compared
to pixel-based certified-training counterparts for the same overall verified accuracy of 88%. The
variations are measured as L2 distances in the pixel-space. The respective % increase in pixel-
space variations that can be certified for Chest X-Rays, LSUN, and FFHQ are 22%, 19%, 24%.
We conclude with a human-study of the quality of the generative model for different ranges of
latent-space variations revealing that pixel-space variations up to 62% of the nominal values result in
realistic generated images indistinguishable from real images by humans."

AU D I TAI: A DEEP LEARNING AUDIT FRAMEWORK"
INTRODUCTION,0.06278026905829596,"In this section, we describe the details of our framework, AuditAI outlined in Fig. 1 for verifying
and testing deep models before deployment. We propose to use unit tests to verify variations of
interest that are semantically-aligned. The advantage of AuditAI is that the verified input ranges
are given by several semantically aligned specifications for the end-user to follow during deployment.
In the following sub-sections, we formally define unit tests, outline the verification approach, and
describe the specifics of AuditAI with a GAN-bridge shown in Fig. 2."
UNIT TEST DEFINITION,0.06726457399103139,"2.1
UNIT TEST DEFINITION
Consider a machine learning model f : X →Y that predicts outputs y ∈Y from inputs x ∈X in
dataset D. Each of our unit test can be formulated as providing guarantees such that:"
UNIT TEST DEFINITION,0.07174887892376682,"F(x, y) ≤0
∀x s.t. , ei(x) ∈Si,in, y = f(x)
(1)"
UNIT TEST DEFINITION,0.07623318385650224,"Here, i subscripts an unit test, encoder ei extracts the variation of interest from the input x, and Si,in
denotes the set of range of variation that this unit test verifies. If the condition is satisfied, then our
unit test specifies that the output of the model f(x) would satisfy the constraint given by F(·, ·) ≤0."
UNIT TEST DEFINITION,0.08071748878923767,"For example, x could be an image of a human face, and f could be a classifier for whether the
person is wearing eyeglasses (f ≤0 means wearing eyeglasses and f > 0 means not wearing
eyeglasses). Then ei(·) could be extracting the angle of the face from the image, and Si,in could be
the set {ei(x)| ∀x |ei(x)| < 30◦} constraining the rotation to be smaller than 30◦. And F(x, y) =
−f(x)f(x0◦) ≤0 says that our classifier output would not be changed from the corresponding
output of x0◦, the face image of x without any rotation. In this case, when the end-user is going to
deploy f on a face image, they can first apply ei(·) to see if the face angle lies within Si,in to decide
whether to use the model f."
VERIFICATION OUTLINE,0.08520179372197309,"2.2
VERIFICATION OUTLINE
Given a specification F(x, y) ≤0, we need to next answer the following questions:"
VERIFICATION OUTLINE,0.08968609865470852,"1. How do we obtain the corresponding components (ei, Si,in) in Eq. (1)?
2. What can we do to guarantee that F(x, y) ≤0 is indeed satisfied in this case?"
VERIFICATION OUTLINE,0.09417040358744394,"For the sake of illustration, we first consider a scenario with a less realistic assumption. We will then
discuss how we can relax this assumption. In this scenario, we assume that we are already given
the encoder ei and a corresponding generator gi that inverts ei. Continuing the previous example,
ei can extract the face angle of a given face image. On the other hand, gi(x0◦, d◦) would be able to
synthesize arbitrary face image xd◦that is the same as x0◦except being rotated by d◦."
VERIFICATION OUTLINE,0.09865470852017937,"Figure 2: Instead of variations at the level of input (e.g. pixels),
consider variations in the latent space. Given a specification, we use
a variant of interval-bound propagation (IBP) to verify if the spec-
ification is satisfied for ϵ-ball latent space variations for particular
latent dimensions."
VERIFICATION OUTLINE,0.1031390134529148,"Given the generator gi and the en-
coder ei, we propose to obtain Si,in
building on interval bound propaga-
tion (IBP) (Gowal et al., 2018). We
include a treatment of IBP prelimi-
naries in Appendix A.1. Here, Si,in
is the largest set of variations such
that the specification F(x, y) ≤0
is satisfied.
Given a set of varia-
tions Si,in, IBP-based methods can
be used to obtain a bound on the out-
put of the network Si,out = {y :
ly ≤y ≤uy} and it can be checked
whether the specification F(x, y) ≤
0 is satisfied for all values in Si,out.
We can start with a initial set S0
i,in
and apply gi to this set. Then, we can first find out what would be the corresponding convex bound of
variations of S0
i,in in the image space X. We can subsequently propagate this bound in X through f
to Y to get S0
i,out and check whether F(x, y) ≤0 is satisfied. By iteratively searching for the largest
set Sj
i,in such that F(x, y) ≤0 is still satisfied by Sj
i,out, we can obtain Si,in given F."

CERTIFIED TRAINING THROUGH LATENT REPRESENTATION"
CERTIFIED TRAINING THROUGH LATENT REPRESENTATION,0.11210762331838565,"In the previous section, we are able to find the set Si,in such that Eq. (1) is satisfied given specification
F, encoder ei, generator gi. However, there are several challenges that limit the practical application
of this scenario. First and foremost, while significant progress has been made in generative models,
especially controlled generation (Brock et al., 2018; Karras et al., 2017), the assumption of having gi
apriori is still unrealistic. In addition, since the propagated bound is convex, one can imagine that the
bound in X (high dimensional image-space) would be much larger than needed. This leads to a much
narrower estimate of Si,in. While it could be true that Eq. (1) is satisfied, we still need a non-trivial
size of Si,in for the framework to be useful. For example, if Si,in constrains face angle rotations to
be within 1◦then it may not be practical for the end-user."
CERTIFIED TRAINING THROUGH LATENT REPRESENTATION,0.11659192825112108,"For auditing ML models thoroughly, we require clear separation between the development and testing
phases (i.e. black-box verification). However, it might also be desirable in practice to train the model
in such a way that the unit tests are likely to be satisfied in the first place. In this case, we do have
a tighter connection between the designer and the verifier. We show that by relaxing the black-box
constraint, we can simultaneously address the previously listed challenges in a white-box setting."
CERTIFIED TRAINING THROUGH LATENT REPRESENTATION,0.1210762331838565,"Now that we have access to the internal working and design of the ML model f, we propose to
bypass the image generation step in our verification process through the use of latent disentangled
representations. More specifically, consider a ML model mapping f : X →Z →Y (denote by
fd : Z →Y the downstream task) and a generative model mapping g : X →Z →ˆ
X, such that f
and g share a common latent space Z by virtue of having a common encoder e(·) (Fig. 2)."
CERTIFIED TRAINING THROUGH LATENT REPRESENTATION,0.12556053811659193,"Since Si,in is a subset of the range of e, we have Si,in ⊆Z. This further implies that we do not have
to apply IBP through g and the whole f. Instead we only have to apply it through fd, which does
not involve the expansion to the pixel space X. We show in the experiment (Section 4) that this is
important to have a practically useful Si,in. In addition, AuditAI also alleviates the need of having
a perfect generative model, as long as we can learn a latent space Z through an inference mechanism."
CERTIFIED TRAINING THROUGH LATENT REPRESENTATION,0.13004484304932734,"Learning the latent space. There are three requirements for the latent space. First, it should be
semantically-aligned for us to specify unit tests in this space. A good example is disentangled
representation (Higgins et al., 2018; Tran et al., 2017), where a set of dimensions of the latent code
would correspond to a semantically aligned variation of the original image. As shown in Figure 2, a
latent dimension could correspond to the pose variation, and we can select ei to be the value of this
dimension, and Si,in as the proper range that the model would be verified for. Second, our model
should be verifiable, where the latent space is learned such that the corresponding Si,in is as large
as possible given a specification function F. In this case, AuditAI can be seen as doing certified
training (Zhang et al., 2019b) to improve the verifiability of the model. Finally, the latent space
should be able to perform well on the downstream task through fd. Combining these three criteria,
our full training criteria: L = Ltask + γLspec + δLgen combines three losses Lgen, Lspec, and Ltask that
would encourage interpretability through the latent space of a generative model, verifiability, and task
performance respectively. γ and δ are relative weights (between 0 and 1) for the loss function terms.
We explain each of the losses below:"
CERTIFIED TRAINING THROUGH LATENT REPRESENTATION,0.13452914798206278,"Verifiability (Lspec). Let fd be a feedforward model (can have fully connected / convolutional /
residual layers) with K layers zk+1 = hk(Wkzk + bk),
k = 0, ..., K −1, where, z0 = e(x), zK
denotes the output logits, and hk is the activation function for the kth layer. The set of variations
Si,in could be such that the lp norm for the ith latent dimension is bounded by ϵ, i.e. Si,in = {z :
||zi −z0,i||p ≤ϵ}. We can bound the output of the network Sout = {zK : lK ≤zK ≤uK} through
a variant of interval bound propagation (IBP). Let the specification be F(z, y) = cT zK + d ≤

CERTIFIED TRAINING THROUGH LATENT REPRESENTATION,0.13901345291479822,"For a classification task, this specification implies that the output logits zK should satisfy a linear
relationship for each latent space variation such that the classification outcome arg maxi zK,i remains
equal to the true outcome ytrue corresponding to z0. To verify the specification, IBP based methods

problem, and checking whether the optimal value is ≤0."

Then, we can define Lspec as Lspec = CE(ˆzK, ytrue). In practice, we do not use IBP, but an improved
approach CROWN-IBP (Zhang et al., 2019b) that provides tighter bounds and more stable training,
based on the AutoLiRPA library (Xu et al., 2020). We mention details about this in the Appendix."

semantically aligned concepts. Let the overall loss be Lgen which could also encapsulate other losses
for more semantically-aligned disentanglement. Typically we would train this generative model on a

THEORETICAL RESULTS"
THEORETICAL RESULTS,0.18834080717488788,"We show that although AuditAI considers perturbations in the latent space that allows a large range
of semantic variations in the pixel-space, it retains the theoretical guarantees of provable verification

Theorem 1 (Verification. The auditor can verify whether the trained model from the designer satisfies
the specifications, by generating a proof of the same). Let x ∈X be the input, z0 = e(x) be the latent
code, fd be a feed-forward neural network with bounded derivatives, and Si,in = {z : ||zi −z0,i||p ≤

responding to specific classes. So, latent per-
turbations correspond to variations in different
images within the same class. The specification
for verification is that the classifier outputs the
correct class for all latent perturbations ϵ. This
is an unit test because we can verify with respect
to each class separately. Table 1 shows results
for different ϵ on the test set. The results con-
firm the intuition that increasing ϵ increases the

training approach with our framework, both trained with the same underlying algorithm CROWN-

perturbation for AuditAI (call it ϵ1) and the pixel perturbation for the pixel-based approach (call it
ϵ2). Based on ϵ2 we compute the bound for the intermediate latent node, ϵ21. Since comparing ϵ1 and
ϵ21 directly may not be meaningful due to different nominal values of the latent code, we consider the
fraction ϵ/znom and plot the resulting values in Table 2. We observe that ϵ1/znom1 >> ϵ21/znom21
indicating tolerance to much larger latent variations. Since a wider latent variation corresponds to a
wider set of generated images, AuditAI effectively verifies over a larger range of image variations,
compared to perturbations at the level of pixels. In addition, when we translate the latent perturbations
of AuditAI to the pixel space of the generative model, we obtain on average 20%, and 17% larger

ATTACKING IMAGES AUDITED BY AU D I TAI IN THE PIXEL-SPACE,0.34080717488789236,"In this section, we analyze what fraction of images audited by AuditAI can be attacked in the
pixel-space through adversarial corruptions. We create test examples with varying brightness of the
scene, corresponding to the setting in Table 5. These are real variations directly by modifying pixels
to changing the brightness of the scene . We evaluate AuditAI trained the same way as in Table 5,
but evaluated on this test set after certified training. For ϵ = 0.5, 96 out of 1000 images (only 9.6%)
certified by AuditAI can be attacked in the pixel-space, while for ϵ = 1.5, 85 out of 1000 images
(only 8.5%) certified by AuditAI can be attacked. We use CROWN-IBP (Zhang et al., 2019b)
to determine if an image is attackable in the pixel-space. These results show that the certification
provided by AuditAI is robust, and although verification is done in the latent space of a generative
model, the results hold under real pixel-perturbations as well."

HUMAN STUDY: HOW REALISTIC ARE THE GENERATED IMAGES?"
ATTACKING IMAGES AUDITED BY AU D I TAI IN THE PIXEL-SPACE,0.34977578475336324,"We employ Amazon Mechanical Turk (Buhrmester et al., 2016) to better understand the generative
model trained for the Chest X-ray dataset and determine the limits of latent space variations for which
generations are realistic. This study is to determine the maximum value of ϵ for which generations
are realistic to the human eye, such that we verify and report in the spec-sheet values of ϵ only up to
the range of realistic generations. We note that this study is to understand the generative model and
not the trained classifier. We employ a similar experimental protocol as (Isola et al., 2017; Zhang
et al., 2016) and mention details in the Appendix A.4. We generated 2000 images by sampling latent
codes within each ϵ range of variation. Alongside each ϵ we represent the % with respect to the
nominal value it corresponds to (the nominal value of ϵ is 2.0, so ϵ = 0.5 is 25% of 2.0) in Fig 4. We
see that the humans who participated in our study had close to 50% correct guesses for ϵ up to 1.0,
indicating generations indistinguishable from real images. For ϵ ≥4.0 the correct guess rate is above
70% indicating that the generations in these ranges of latent variations are not realistic, and so the
verified accuracy for these ranges should not be included in the spec-sheet."

RELATED WORK,0.3632286995515695,"Multiple prior works have studied a subset of
the audit problem in terms of adversarial robust-
ness (Raghunathan et al., 2018a; Dvijotham
et al.). Adversarial examples are small pertur-
bations to the input (for images at the level of
pixels; for text at the level of words) which mis-
lead the deep learning model. Generating ad-
versarial examples has been widely studied (Xu
et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a) and recent ap-
proaches have devised defenses against adver-
sarial examples (Xie et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,
2019b). Some of these approaches like (Gowal
et al., 2018) and (Zhang et al., 2019b) pro-
vide provable verification bounds on an out-
put specification based on the magnitude of
perturbations in the input. These approaches
have largely showed robustness and verifica-
tion to norm bounded adversarial perturbations
without trying to verify with respect to more semantically aligned properties of the input. Some
papers (Mohapatra et al., 2020; Ruoss et al., 2020; Balunovi´c et al., 2019; Wong & Kolter, 2020)
consider semantic perturbations like rotation, translation, occlusion, brightness change etc. directly
in the pixel space, so the range of semantic variations that can be considered are more limited. This is
a distinction with AuditAI, where by perturbing latent codes directly (as opposed to pixels), the range
of semantic variations captured are much larger."
RELATED WORK,0.36771300448430494,"A related notion to auditing is expalainable AI (Gunning, 2017). We note that auditing is different
from this problem because explanations can be incorrect while remaining useful. Whereas in auditing,
our aim is not to come up with plausible explanations for why the model behaves in a certain way, but
to quantify how it behaves under semantically-aligned variations of the input."
RELATED WORK,0.3721973094170404,"Some papers (Mandelbaum & Weinshall, 2017; Van Amersfoort et al., 2020) have used model
confidence and ucnertainty estimates for rejecting out-of-distribution samples at test time, which is a
form of auditing. In (Mitchell et al., 2019) and (Gebru et al., 2018), the authors proposed a checklist
of questions that should be answered while releasing DL models and datasets that relate to their
motivation, intended use cases, training details, and ethical considerations. These papers formed a
part of our motivation and provided guidance in formalizing the audit problem for DL models. We
provide a detailed survey of related works in section A.6."

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION"
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION,0.3811659192825112,"In this paper we developed a framework for auditing of deep learning (DL) models. There are
increasingly growing concerns about innate biases in the DL models that are deployed in a wide
range of settings and there have been multiple news articles about the necessity for auditing DL
models prior to deployment12. Our framework formalizes this audit problem which we believe is a
step towards increasing safety and ethical use of DL models during deployment."
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION,0.38565022421524664,"One of the limitations of AuditAI is that its interpretability is limited by that of the built-in
generative model. While exciting progress has been made for generative models, we believe it is
important to incorporate domain expertise to mitigate potential dataset biases and human error in
both training & deployment. Currently, AuditAI doesn’t directly integrate human domain experts
in the auditing pipeline, but indirectly uses domain expertise in the curation of the dataset used for
creating the generative model. Although we have demonstrated AuditAI primarily for auditing
computer vision classification models, we hope that this would pave the way for more sophisticated
domain-dependent AI-auditing tools & frameworks in language modelling and decision-making
applications."

PRELIMINARIES: INTERVAL-BOUND PROPAGATION"
REFERENCES,0.7533632286995515,"In this section, we provide a preliminary treatment of Interval-Bound Propagation based robust
training and verification. Let f be a feedforward classifier model that outputs one of N classes. The
input to the network is an image x0, and it has a certain ground truth class ytrue. The classifier is
trained to minimize a certain misclassification loss. The verification problem is to check whether
there is some set Sin(x0) around perturbations of x0 such that the classification output of the model
remains invariant from that of ytrue."
REFERENCES,0.757847533632287,"Let f have K layers zk+1 = hk(Wkzk + bk),
k = 0, ..., K −1, such that z0 ∈Sin(x0), zK

set of variations to be Sin(x0) = {x|||x −x0||∞≤ϵ}, then we want to verify the specification
that arg maxi zK,i = ytrue

bound on zK, we can propagate bounds for each activate zk through axis-aligned bounding boxes,
zk,i(ϵ) ≤zk,i ≤zk,i(ϵ), where i indexes dimension. Based on this, the specification is upper-
bounded by zK,y(ϵ) −zK,ytrue(ϵ)."

specification is likely to be satisfied in the first place at the end of training. For this, the overall
training loss would consist of two terms: usual classification loss like cross-entropy that maximizes
log likelihood l(zK, ttrue), and a loss term that encourages satisfiying the specification l(ˆzK(ϵ), ttrue).
Here, ˆzK,y(ϵ) = zK,y(ϵ) (if y ̸= ytrue) and ˆzK,y(ϵ) = zK,ytrue(ϵ) (if y = ytrue). So, the overall loss

PROOF OF THE THEOREM"

code, fd be a feed-forward neural network with bounded derivatives, and Si,in = {z : ||zi −z0,i||p ≤
ϵ} be the set of latent perturbations. Then, the verifier is guaranteed to be able to generate a proof for
verifying whether the linear specification on output logits cT zK + d ≤0

that f and g share a common latent space Z by virtue of having a common encoder e(·) (Figure 2).

EXTENDED RELATED WORKS"
REFERENCES,0.9820627802690582,"Adversarial robustness. Multiple prior works have studied a subset of the audit problem in terms of
adversarial robustness (Carlini et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2019; Gowal et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018;
Singh et al., 2019; Weng et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Raghunathan et al.,
2018a;b; Dvijotham et al.). Adversarial examples are small perturbations to the input (for images at
the level of pixels; for text at the level of words) which mislead the deep learning model. Generating
adversarial examples has been widely studied (Zhao et al., 2017; Athalye et al., 2018; Carlini &
Wagner, 2017a;b; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018; Papernot et al., 2016; Xiao et al.,
2019b; 2018b;c; Eykholt et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a) and
recent approaches have devised defenses against adversarial examples (Guo et al., 2018; Song et al.,
2017; Buckman et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2018; Samangouei et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2018a; 2019a; Xie
et al., 2020; Cohen et al., 2019; Gowal et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019b). Some of these approaches
like (Gowal et al., 2018) and (Zhang et al., 2019b) provide provable verification bounds on an output
specification based on the magnitude of perturbations in the input. These approaches have largely
showed robustness and verification to norm bounded adversarial perturbations without trying to
verify with respect to more semantically aligned properties of the input. Some papers (Mohapatra
et al., 2020; Ruoss et al., 2020; Balunovi´c et al., 2019) consider semantic perturbations like rotation,
translation, occlusion, brightness change etc. directly in the pixel space, so the range of semantic"
REFERENCES,0.9865470852017937,"variations that can be considered are more limited. This is a distinction with AuditAI, where by
perturbing latent codes directly (as opposed to pixels), the range of semantic variations captured
are much larger. In (Wong & Kolter, 2020), the authors model perturbation sets for images with
perturbations (like adversarial corruptions) explicitly such that a conditional VAE can be trained.
While, for AuditAI, we identify directions of latent variations that are present in pre-trained GANs,
and as such do not require explicit supervision for training the generative model, and can scale to
datasets like ImageNet and CheXpert, and high dimensional images like that in FFHQ."
REFERENCES,0.9910313901345291,"Neural network interpretability. With the rapid rise of highly reliable generative models, many
recent works have sought to analyze the latent space of such models and how the latent space can be
manipulated to obtain semantic variations in the output image. (Bau et al., 2021) use text embeddings
from CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) to perform directed semantic changes in the generated images, for
example introduction of a particular artifact in the room or change in the color of a bird. (Bau et al.,
2020a; Shen & Zhou, 2020; Shen et al., 2020) identify latent code dimensions corresponding to pose
of the body/face, expression of the face, orientation of beds/cars in the latent space of generative
models like PGGAN (Karras et al., 2017) and StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2019). By manipulating these
latent dimensions, the output images can be controllably varied. In addition, there have been other
papers that sought to understand what the neural network weights are learning in the first place (Bau
et al., 2020b; Yeh et al., 2020) in an attempt to explain the predictions of the networks."

is to audit datasets that are used for training DL models. In (Gebru et al., 2018), the authors
proposed a checklist of questions to be answered while releasing datasets that relate to the motivation,
composition, collection process, processing, and distribution of the dataset. In (Mitchell et al., 2019),
the authors proposed a checklist of questions that should be answered while releasing DL models
that relate to their motivation, intended use cases, training details, and ethical considerations. These
papers formed a part of our motivation and provided guidance in formalizing the audit problem for
DL models."
