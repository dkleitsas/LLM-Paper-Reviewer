ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.004830917874396135,"To obtain a joint representation from multimodal data in variational autoencoders
(VAEs), it is important to infer the representation from arbitrary subsets of modal-
ities after learning. A scalable way to achieve this is to aggregate the inferences
of each modality as experts. A state-of-the-art approach to learning this aggre-
gation of experts is to encourage all modalities to be reconstructed and cross-
generated from arbitrary subsets. However, this learning may be insufﬁcient if
cross-generation is difﬁcult. Furthermore, to evaluate its objective function, expo-
nential generation paths concerning the number of modalities are required. To al-
leviate these problems, we propose to explicitly minimize the divergence between
inferences from arbitrary subsets and the surrogate joint posterior that approxi-
mates the true joint posterior. We also proposed using a gradient origin network, a
deep generative model that learns inferences without using an inference network,
thereby reducing the need for additional parameters by introducing the surrogate
posterior. We demonstrate that our method performs better than existing scalable
multimodal VAEs in inference and generation."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.014492753623188406,"Our world is characterized by many kinds of information. This multimodal information can be
used to form common concepts. For instance, by recognizing information, such as the landscape
of the beach and the salty scent of the ocean, we can form a concept about the sea. In multi-
modal learning (Baltruˇsaitis et al., 2018), it has been studied as the learning of joint representations
from multimodal data, especially using variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2013;
Rezende et al., 2014)."
INTRODUCTION,0.01932367149758454,"The goal of multimodal representation learning with VAEs (Suzuki et al., 2016; Vedantam et al.,
2018; Wu & Goodman, 2018; Shi et al., 2019) is to learn all given multimodal data and to infer a
joint representation from arbitrary subsets of modalities. This representation is useful as an input
to predict the corresponding label information or as an intermediate representation to generate other
modalities, i.e., cross-generations. However, this is difﬁcult because a joint representation must be
inferred even when some of the modalities are missing at test time. The most naive way to deal
with this difﬁculty is to have inference models for all possible combinations of modalities, which is
exponentially necessary given the number of modalities."
INTRODUCTION,0.024154589371980676,"A scalable way to address this is to consider the inferences for each modality as experts and
combine them to approximate the inferences from an arbitrary subset of modalities. There are
two types of methods for aggregating inferences:
products of experts (PoE) (Hinton, 2002)
and mixtures of experts (MoE); VAEs that use these as approximate posteriors are proposed as
MVAE (Wu & Goodman, 2018) and MMVAE (Shi et al., 2019), respectively. Each method has dif-
ferent advantages that exist in a trade-off relationship, i.e., PoE increases the amount of mutual
information with joint representation by increasing the number of modalities, while MoE has the
effect of encouraging cross-generation between modalities."
INTRODUCTION,0.028985507246376812,"Sutter et al. (2021) deﬁned the objective of multimodal VAEs to be that the inference of all possi-
ble subsets approximate the true joint posterior, and derived a generalized evidence lower bound
(ELBO) as a lower bound of that objective. This ELBO can be viewed as using a mixture of prod-
ucts of experts (MoPoE) as an aggregation method for inference, which is to generate all modalities
from PoE-aggregated inference of arbitrary subsets. In other words, this model, called MoPoE-VAE,"

INTRODUCTION,0.03864734299516908,"tries to achieve the above objective of multimodal VAEs by minimizing all reconstruction and cross-
generation errors in all modality combinations. They showed that this is a generalization that has
the advantages of both PoE and MoE. However, these properties of MoPoE-VAE imply that infer-
ence may not be sufﬁciently learned when cross-generation is difﬁcult. Furthermore, the number of
paths for this reconstruction and cross-generation in MoPoE-VAE is required to be exponential with
respect to the number of modalities. Therefore, we pursue a scalable method that realizes the above
objective of multimodal VAEs."
INTRODUCTION,0.043478260869565216,"In this paper, we propose a different approach to achieve this objective. We ﬁrst prepare a surrogate
joint posterior, which approximates the true joint posterior given all modalities, and then minimize
the divergence between the PoE-aggregated inferences and this surrogate posterior. The approx-
imation of surrogate posterior is perform by the usual VAE optimization, and we simultaneously
perform this optimization and the divergence minimization above."
INTRODUCTION,0.04830917874396135,"The advantages of this new approach are twofold. First, if the surrogate model is sufﬁciently close
to the true posterior, then optimizing this objective function explicitly achieves the objective of
multimodal VAEs deﬁned in MoPoE, i.e, approximating inferences from arbitrary subsets to the true
posterior. Second, unlike MoPoE, this method is not exponentially more expensive. This is because
this method is based on divergence minimization of all inference models, rather than reconstruction
or cross-generation of all modalities in combination. Although this method requires an additional
surrogate model, the size is not exponential as in previous similar methods (Suzuki et al., 2016;
Vedantam et al., 2018), but only doubles the number of parameters in encoders. Therefore, we call
this method a scalable multimodal VAE (SMVAE)."
INTRODUCTION,0.05314009661835749,"Furthermore, to reduce the number of parameters in the surrogate posterior, we propose to use
variational gradient origin networks (VGONs) (Bond-Taylor & Willcocks, 2020) for training the
surrogate posterior. VGONs are deep generative models that can rapidly acquire amortized inference
to representations without a trainable network. We call our method that uses VGONs for surrogate
posterior SMVGON."
INTRODUCTION,0.057971014492753624,"Experiments show that the proposed method performs better than conventional methods in infer-
ring joint representations and generating modalities on commonly used multimodal benchmarks.
In particular, we show that the proposed method improves the performance in situations where the
conventional methods have difﬁculty in cross-generation. We also conﬁrm that the performance of
SMVGONs with VGONs is comparable to that of SMVAEs when the input modalities are relatively
simple, without the need for additional inference networks for surrogate posteriors."

property that increasing the size of the subset, i.e., the number of input modalities, leads to an in-
crease in the information content of the inferred latent variables. However, the objective function of

RELATED WORKS,0.4492753623188406,"For learning unsupervised joint representations from multimodal data, autoencoder-based methods
have been used (Ngiam et al., 2011; Silberer & Lapata, 2014); however, they have difﬁculties in the
challenge of missing modalities. Joint representation learning using deep belief networks (Hinton,
2009) or deep Boltzmann machines (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009) can adequately handle missing
modalities (Srivastava & Salakhutdinov, 2012; Srivastava et al., 2012; Sohn et al., 2014), but has
difﬁculty scaling to large dataset."
RELATED WORKS,0.45410628019323673,"Early multimodal learning using VAEs dealt with cross-generation of two modalities, such as
conditional VAEs (Sohn et al., 2015; Kingma et al., 2014) and conditional multi-modal autoen-
coders (Pandey & Dukkipati, 2017). However, because these methods directly learn conditional
generative models, they cannot perform bidirectional generation between modalities, nor can they
obtain joint latent representations of different modalities."
RELATED WORKS,0.45893719806763283,"Some studies of multimodal VAEs require additional inference models (Suzuki et al., 2016;
Vedantam et al., 2018; Korthals et al., 2019; Wu & Goodman, 2019). Suzuki et al. (2016) pointed
out that VAEs trained on all modalities have the problem of missing modalities in inference, and
propose to approximate the unimodal inference models to explicitly approach the joint inference
model of VAEs. The objective function of JMVAE is the ELBO of VAE given multimodal inputs
minus the KL divergence corresponding to the above approximation.3 Vedantam et al. (2018) intro-
duced TELBO, where the objective function is composed of the sum of ELBOs that take each set
of modalities as input, using the same models as JMVAE. Korthals et al. (2019) introduced M2VAE
that can be regarded as a combination of JMVAE and TELBO, and Wu & Goodman (2019) pro-
posed VAEVAE that excludes a KL divergence term between joint inference and prior from it. They
are learned end-to-end with a single objective function, except for TELBO."
RELATED WORKS,0.463768115942029,"The challenge with these models is that they require inference models for all modality combina-
tions, i.e., the number of inference models grows exponentially with the number of modalities. Our
proposed method is similar to these methods; however, unlike these methods, required memory cost
is linear in the number of modalities. Kutuzova et al. (2021) proposed to introduce additional uni-
modal inference models instead of a joint inference model, and to reduce the number of required
inference models to the square of the number of modalities. However, this also does not scale with
the number of modalities compared to our linear cost model."

imates joint inference with any combination of unimodals, which allows to learn inferences from
arbitrary modalities. The second is the design of a joint inference. MMJSD considers a dynamic
prior that combines all unimodal inferences and considers it a joint inference. However, there is
no guarantee that this dynamic prior approximates the true posterior as in the surrogate posterior
of SMVAE. In addition, since MMJSD uses the same networks for a joint inference and unimodal
inferences, it might be difﬁcult for this joint inference to achieve all of the approximations to the
true posterior and to inferences from arbitrary modalities."
RELATED WORKS,0.48792270531400966,"The other topic in multimodal VAEs is the acquisition of modality-speciﬁc latent variables, apart
from the global latent variables that embed all modalities (Tsai et al., 2018; Hsu & Glass, 2018;

possibility of inferring a single joint representation from arbitrary subset of modalities. In the exper-

where the conventional method achieves by adding modality-speciﬁc latent variables."

SVHN (Shi et al., 2019) with the addition of the text modality, which represents the English name
of each number as text and randomly changes the starting index to give a diversity. Bimodal CelebA
is a dataset of face images from the CelebA (Liu et al., 2015) with additional text describing the
corresponding attribute labels. The PolyMNIST dataset consists of a set of ﬁve different MNIST
images with different backgrounds and handwriting styles, each of which is considered a different
modality. Different modalities of the same example have the same digits."
EXPERIMENTS,0.5072463768115942,"We conﬁrm that the proposed model realizes the objective of Equation 5, i.e., it can properly infer
representations and generate modalities from arbitrary subsets. To evaluate this quantitatively, we
estimate the performance of the representation by training a linear classiﬁer under inference from
all modalities and predicting by it from the representation inferred from subsets. If this evaluation
results in high performance on different subsets, it means that the inference from the subsets is suc-
cessful. We also perform cross-generation from arbitrary modalities and evaluate the performance
of the generated modalities by pre-trained classiﬁers from Sutter et al. (2020). 4 The interpretation
of this evaluation is the same as in the case of representation."

dimension value by all likelihoods so that the coefﬁcient of the likelihood term with the largest
dimension was 1. We use Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) for optimization, with a learning rate of

CONCLUSION,0.6666666666666666,"In this study, we proposed SMVAE, which approximates inference from subsets by explicitly mini-
mizing the divergence from the surrogate posterior distribution. The model is scalable with respect
to the number of modalities and shows high performance in inference and generation, especially
in the case where cross-generation is difﬁcult. Furthermore, to reduce the parameters of the infer-
ence model, we introduced SMVGON using VGON, which can learn inference without inference
networks. The remaining task of this study is to ﬁnd a way to introduce a surrogate posterior dis-
tribution that will result in good inference with low memory and computational costs. VGON per-
formed well on MNIST-SVHN-Text, but did not perform well on challenging problem settings such
as Bimodal CelebA and PolyMNIST. In the future, we would like to address this issue and pursue
effective methods for a wide range of multimodal datasets."

REFERENCES,0.8888888888888888,"Compared to Equation 11, the difference is that the direction of KL divergence is reversed and
aggregation by PoE is not used. Table 4 shows the results of comparing SMVAE and JMVAE on
the Bimodal CelebA dataset. The performance of the representations is almost the same, but the
generation results are better for SMVAE. This may indicate that the KL divergence direction of
SMVAE is better for cross-generation."

EFFECTIVENESS OF END-TO-END LEARNING IN SMVAE"

the results of two steps, i.e., ﬁrst optimizing surrogate inference and then minimizing KL divergence
with inference from arbitrary modalities. The dataset is PolyMNIST; in two stages, 200 epochs were
trained in the ﬁrst stage and 100 epochs in the second stage. The results show that the end-to-end
method gives better results. This may be due to the fact that the two distributions are more easily
approximated by training them simultaneously."
