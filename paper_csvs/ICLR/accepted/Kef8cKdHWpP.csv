ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0047169811320754715,"We consider the problem of sequential robotic manipulation of deformable objects
using tools. Previous works have shown that differentiable physics simulators pro-
vide gradients to the environment state and help trajectory optimization to converge
orders of magnitude faster than model-free reinforcement learning algorithms for
deformable object manipulation. However, such gradient-based trajectory opti-
mization typically requires access to the full simulator states and can only solve
short-horizon, single-skill tasks due to local optima. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, named DiffSkill, that uses a differentiable physics simulator
for skill abstraction to solve long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks
from sensory observations. In particular, we ﬁrst obtain short-horizon skills using
individual tools from a gradient-based optimizer, using the full state information in
a differentiable simulator; we then learn a neural skill abstractor from the demon-
stration trajectories which takes RGBD images as input. Finally, we plan over
the skills by ﬁnding the intermediate goals and then solve long-horizon tasks. We
show the advantages of our method in a new set of sequential deformable object
manipulation tasks compared to previous reinforcement learning algorithms and
compared to the trajectory optimizer. Videos are available at our project page1."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.014150943396226415,"Robot manipulation of deformable objects is a fundamental research problem in the ﬁeld of robotics
and AI and has many real-world applications such as laundry making (Maitin-Shepard et al., 2010),
cooking (Bollini et al., 2013), and caregiving tasks like assistive dressing, feeding or bed bathing (Er-
ickson et al., 2020). The recent development of differentiable physics simulators for deformable
objects has shown promising results for solving soft-body control problems (Hu et al., 2019b; Murthy
et al., 2020; Heiden et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021). These differentiable simulators have facilitated
gradient-based trajectory optimizers to ﬁnd a motion trajectory with much fewer samples, compared
with black box optimizers such as CEM or reinforcement learning algorithms (Huang et al., 2021;
Heiden et al., 2021; Geilinger et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.018867924528301886,"However, the usage of these simulators is often limited in two ways. First, most differentiable physics
simulators are only applied to solve short-horizon, single-skill tasks, such as cutting (Heiden et al.,
2021), ball throwing (Geilinger et al., 2020), or locomotion (Hu et al., 2019b). This is partly because
the gradient only provides local information, and thus, gradient-based optimizers often get stuck in
local optima, preventing them from solving long horizon tasks. For example, consider a two-stage
task of ﬁrst gathering scattered dough on a table and then putting it on the cutting board using
a spatula (Figure 1). If the objective function is to minimize the distance between all the dough"

INTRODUCTION,0.06132075471698113,"Figure 1: Humans use various tools to manipulate deformable objects much more effectively than state-of-the-art
robotic systems. This work aims to narrow the gap and develop a method named DiffSkill that learns to use tools
like a rolling pin, spatula, knife, etc., to accomplish complicated dough manipulation tasks. Our method learns
skill abstraction using a differentiable physics simulator, composes the skills for long-horizon manipulation of
the dough, and evalulated in three challenging sequential deformable object manipulations tasks: LiftSpread,
GatherTransport, and CutRearrange."
INTRODUCTION,0.0660377358490566,"and the cutting board, a gradient-based trajectory optimizer would directly use the spatula to put a
small amount of dough on the cutting board without ever using the gathering operation. Second, the
agent needs to know the full simulation state and relevant physical parameters in order to perform
gradient-based trajectory optimization, which is a great limiting factor for real-world generalization,
as reliable full state estimation of deformable objects from sensory data like RGB-D images can often
be challenging and sometimes impossible due to ambiguities caused by self-occlusions."
INTRODUCTION,0.07075471698113207,"Planning over the temporal abstraction of skills is a powerful approach to tackle the ﬁrst issue of
solving long horizon tasks. However, ﬁnding a suitable set of skills is challenging. For example,
while standard skills such as grasping an object or moving the robot arm from one pose to another
may be manually speciﬁed (Toussaint et al., 2018), more complex skills such as cutting or gathering
can be difﬁcult to deﬁne manually. Therefore, it is desirable to learn these skills automatically."
INTRODUCTION,0.07547169811320754,"In this work, we aim to solve a novel set of sequential dough manipulation tasks that involve operating
various tools and multiple stages of actions (Figure 1), including lifting and spreading, gathering and
transporting, cutting and rearranging the dough. To extend the use of differentiable physics models to
these long-horizon tasks and enable the agent to directly consume visual observations, we propose
DiffSkill: a novel framework where the agent learns skill abstraction using the differentiable physics
model and composes them to accomplish complicated manipulation tasks. Our method consists
of three components, (1) a trajectory optimizer that acts as an expert that applies gradient-based
optimization on the differentiable simulator to obtain demonstration trajectories, which requires
the full state information from the simulator (2) a neural skill abstractor that is instantiated as a
goal-conditioned policy, taking RGBD images as input and imitating the demonstration trajectories,
and (3) a planner that learns to assemble the abstracted skills by opgimizing the intermediate goals
to reach and solve the long horizon tasks. Experiments show that our method, operating on the
high-dimensional RGB-D images, can successfully accomplish a set of the dough manipulation tasks,
which greatly outperforms the model-free RL baselines and the standalone gradient-based trajectory
optimizer."

the two particle sets as the distance metric D(st, sg), which we approximate with the Sinkhorn
Divergence (Séjourné et al., 2019) . To encourage the manipulator to approach the deformable
object, we additionally add into the objective the Euclidean distance between the manipulator and the
deformable object E(m(st), d(st)), with a weight λ, where m(st) and d(st) are the positions of the
center of mass of the manipulator and deformable object at time t, respectively. We solve Equation 1

NEURAL SKILL ABSTRACTION"
NEURAL SKILL ABSTRACTION,0.25943396226415094,"Although the trajectory optimizer is able to provide solutions for short-horizon tasks, it is unable to
solve long-horizon tasks due to local optima. Furthermore, running the trajectory optimizer requires
knowing the full state of the environment, including particle positions and mass distributions of the
deformable objects and the physical parameters of these objects. This information is difﬁcult to
obtain during real-world deployment, where the observations available to a robot are from sensory
information such as RGB-D images. Additionally, the trajectory optimizer takes minutes to run,
which is too slow during evaluation for real-time applications."
NEURAL SKILL ABSTRACTION,0.2641509433962264,"As such, we propose to learn a neural skill abstractor that learns skills from the demonstration videos
of a trajectory optimizer; we will then leverage these skills for solving long horizon tasks. Our neural
skill abstraction consists of a goal-conditioned policy that takes a sensory observation (RGB-D images
in our case) as input, a feasibility and reward predictor, as well as a variational auto-encoder (VAE)."
NEURAL SKILL ABSTRACTION,0.2688679245283019,"Goal conditioned policy: For each tool, we learn a goal-conditioned neural policy at = πk(ot, og) ∈
A(k), using behavior cloning from the corresponding demonstration trajectories collected for the
kth tool. Given the demonstration trajectory (s0, a0, . . . , sT ) and the corresponding RGB-D sensory
observations (o0, . . . oT ), as well as an observation of the goal og, we train a policy using the MSE
loss Lpolicy = ||π(ot, og) −at||2
2. Furthermore, to make the policy more robust to goal observations
outside of the training goal images, we adopt hindsight relabeling (Andrychowicz et al., 2017). When
sampling from the demonstration buffer, with a probability phind, we will relabel the original goal og
with a hindsight goal ¯oi, where ¯oi ∼Uniform{ot+1, . . . oT }. The intuition is that, for any goal that
will be achieved by the current action sequence, the policy should imitate the current action."
NEURAL SKILL ABSTRACTION,0.27358490566037735,"Variational Auto-Encoder: As will be explained in Section 2.4, we will plan to compose skills in
a latent space instead of optimizing directly in the image space. To learn the latent space, we train
a generative model of the observation space, speciﬁcally a VAE Kingma & Welling (2013). The
VAE includes an encoder z = Q(o) that encodes an observation into a ﬁxed length latent vector,
and a decoder o = G(z) that decodes back into the observation space. The VAE is trained such that
G(z), z ∼N(0, I) reproduces the observation distribution."
NEURAL SKILL ABSTRACTION,0.2783018867924528,"Feasibility Predictor: For each skill, we learn a feasibility predictor fk(zt, zg) ∈R to determine
the feasibility of reaching from ot to og using the trajectory optimizer, where zt = Q(ot), zg =
Q(og). For training the feasibility predictor, we obtain positive pairs by sampling (zt1, zt2) from the
same demonstration trajectory and negative pairs by sampling pairs of observations from different
trajectories. We additionally add negative pairs (z1, z2) where both z1 and z2 are sampled from a
unit Gaussian distribution in the VAE latent space. We assign a label of 1 for positive pairs and
a label of 0 for negative pairs. We use an MSE loss Lfea for model training, which was shown
empirically to work better than a cross-entropy loss. While there may be false negative pairs, we ﬁnd
the feasibility predictor to perform reasonably well, as different trajectories have different initial and
goal conﬁgurations and it is less likely that the state of a different conﬁguration (e.g. mass of the
dough) can be achieved from the current state within one skill. This intuition was similarly used for
goal relabeling in previous work by Lin et al. (2019)."

and rotate along the vertical plane. The gripper can translate along the horizontal plane, rotate
around its center and open or close the gripper.
• CutRearrange: This is a three-step task. Given an initial pile of dough, the agent needs to ﬁrst
cut the dough in half using a knife. Inspired by the recent cutting simulation (Heiden et al., 2021),
we model the knife using a thin surface as the body and a prism as the blade. Next, the agent needs
to use the gripper to transport each piece of the cut dough to target locations."

bound of a policy that perfectly match the two distributions. The maximum normalized performance
of 1 may not always be possible. For example, due to the incompressibility of the dough, certain
target shape may be too small for a large dough to ﬁt into. As such, we additionally set a threshold
on the Sinkhorn divergence for each task such that the task is assume to be completed successfully
when EMD is below the threshold. This threshold is manually picked by observing the performance
gap between successful and failed trajectories. For each task, 5 initial and target conﬁgurations are
given for evaluation, which all require multi-stage manipulation of the dough. We report both the

for learning short-horizon skills from the demonstration dataset. In Table 3, we can see that the
learned skills (labeled as Behavior Cloning) approach the normalized performance of the trajectory
optimization (Trajectory Opt) on single-tool use, although they cannot solve the long-horizon tasks."

BASELINES,0.4339622641509434,"Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) We compare with two model-free RL methods: TD3 (Fu-
jimoto et al., 2018) and SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018). The RL methods use the same encoder architec-
ture as DiffSkill and receive the negative of the cost function used for the trajectory optimizer as the
reward function. We train the RL agents with either a single tool, or with both tools where the agent
controls them simultaneously."
BASELINES,0.4386792452830189,"Behavior Cloning We compare with another baseline that directly trains a goal-conditioned policy
with Behavior Cloning (BC) and hindsight relabeling using all tools. The agent is trained with the
same dataset and jointly controls all tools."

BASELINES,0.4481132075471698,"Trajectory Opt (Oracle) We compare with the trajectory optimizer used to generate the demon-
stration, with the same parameters. Note that this method requires full state of the simulation and
multiple forward and backward passes through the simulator during evaluation time."

RESULT ANALYSIS"
RESULT ANALYSIS,0.46226415094339623,"We show that DiffSkill is able to solve the challenging long-horizon, tool-use tasks from the sensory
observation (RGB-D) while the baselines cannot. The quantitative results can be found in Table 1.
Tool A refers to the spatula for LiftSpread, the parallel gripper for GatherTransport and the knife for
the CutRearrange environment, while tool B refers to the rolling pin, the spatula and the gripper for
each task respectively."
RESULT ANALYSIS,0.4669811320754717,"First, we can compare the rows for single-tool use. All baselines are able to solve one-stage of the
task, achieving a reasonable performance, if the correct tool is used (e.g. tool A for LiftSpread and
GatherTransport), although for cutting, the performance is still close to zero with cutting only, since
cutting itself does not reduce the distance between the current dough and the desired dough locations.
BC can well approach the performance of the corresponding trajectory optimizer despite being a
policy that only receives RGB-D input. SAC can also solve some of the single-stage tasks such as
lifting or transporting, while TD3 performs worse."
RESULT ANALYSIS,0.4716981132075472,"Second, with multiple tools, we can see that DiffSkill signiﬁcantly outperforms the single-skill policy.
Remarkably, DiffSkill even outperforms the trajectory optimizer that controls both tools at the same
time, which uses the full simulation state during evaluation time. This indicates that high-level
planning over skills is necessary for achieving these sequential manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we
show visualization of the found solutions of DiffSkill in Figure 3. We can see that DiffSkill is able to
ﬁnd reasonable intermediate goal state such as ﬁrst putting the dough on the cutting board, or gather
dough onto the spatula. CutRearrange is shown to be a harder task, with all methods performing
poorly. This is because it requires three stages of manipulation; further, it is non-trivial to transport
the dough without deforming it too much. Still, DiffSkill is able to achieve higher success, even
though the trajectory optimizer oracle achieves a higher average score. This is because the trajectory
optimizer is more reliable at ﬁnding partial solutions that transport part of the dough to the target
locations but does not complete the full task. Please see our website for visualizations of different
methods."

ABLATION ANALYSIS,0.5518867924528302,"Second, we try to remove the planning over the continuous variables, i.e. the intermediate goals.
Without the intermediate goals, we directly use the ﬁnal target image as the goal for sequentially
executing each skill. This ablation is labeled as Direct Execution. Since we do not have the
intermediate goals anymore, we try two different ways of choosing the skills to execute at each stage:
Randomly pick one skill and an oracle that execute each combination of skills in the simulator and
choose the best one in hindsight. The results are shown in Table 2. Without discrete planning, the
policy performs poorly. This is probably because during training, a single policy and feasibility
predictor is used for learning two modes of skills that are very different and the policy is unable to
differentiable for different modes or decide when to switch modes. On the other hand, if we do not
optimize for the intermediate goals, we also cannot determine which tools to use at evaluation time,
since both the feasibility predictor requires intermediate goals as input. In this case, we can see that
using random skills at each stage results in poor performance. Even if the oracle skill order is used,
there is still a drop in performance as the policy may not work well given only a future goal instead
of an immediate goal."

RELATED WORK,0.5754716981132075,"Motion Planning with Differentiable Physics. Differentiable physics models provide the gradients
of the future states with respect to the initial state and the input actions. Compared with black-box
dynamics models, planning with differentiable physics models can often make more accurate updates
on the action sequences and deliver better sample efﬁciency (Huang et al., 2021). Over the past
few years, researchers have built differentiable physics models from ﬁrst principles rooted in our
understanding of physics for various physical systems, ranging from multi-body systems (Degrave
et al., 2019; Tedrake & the Drake Development Team, 2019; de Avila Belbute-Peres et al., 2018;

RELATED WORK,0.5849056603773585,"gradient to solve inverse problems like parameter identiﬁcation and control synthesis. A complement
thread of methods tried to relax the assumption that we have to know the full state and the physics
equations; instead, they employ deep neural networks to learn the dynamics models directly from
observation data and use the gradients from the learned models to aid motion planning or policy
learning (Battaglia et al., 2016; Chang et al., 2016; Mrowca et al., 2018; Ummenhofer et al., 2019;
Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020; Pfaff et al., 2020; Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019;
2018). Our method differs from prior works in that we use the differentiable physics model for skill
abstraction and compose the learned skills for long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects."
RELATED WORK,0.589622641509434,"Deformable Object Manipulation. Deformable objects have more degrees of freedom and are
typically more challenging to manipulate than rigid objects. Extensive work has been done in this
area, focusing on different types of deformable objects, including plasticine (Li et al., 2018; Huang
et al., 2021), ﬂuid (Li et al., 2021), cloth (Maitin-Shepard et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2021; Weng et al.,
2021; Ha & Song, 2021; Wu et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2020; Ganapathi et al., 2020), rope (Nair
et al., 2017; Sundaresan et al., 2020), and object piles (Suh & Tedrake, 2020). People have also
come up with standard benchmarks to establish a fairer comparison between various algorithms (Lin
et al., 2020). Our method aims to manipulate dough using tools similar to how humans would
do in a kitchen environment (Figure 1). There are also a series of works on tool-using for object
manipulation (Toussaint et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2019), but most of
them focus on rigid objects, whereas we take a step further and tackle deformable objects."
RELATED WORK,0.5943396226415094,"Solving Long Horizon Tasks. Our work aims to solve long-horizon manipulation tasks; thus, it
is also closely related to task and motion planning (TAMP) that contains elements of discrete task
planning and continuous motion planning. (Gravot et al., 2005; Kaelbling & Lozano-Pérez, 2010;
2013; Toussaint et al., 2018; Garrett et al., 2021). However, most TAMP approaches assume a fully
speciﬁed state space, dynamics model as well as a set of pre-deﬁned skills such as grasping, pushing,
or placing (Toussaint et al., 2018). Differing from prior works, our method learns a policy over
RGB-D inputs and generates motion trajectories and skill abstractions by applying gradient-based
trajectory optimization techniques using a differentiable simulator."
RELATED WORK,0.5990566037735849,"Our feasibility predictor also relates to previous works that plan over the temporal abstraction of
options (Sutton et al., 1999) or skills. In order to do planning, these approaches deﬁne a multi-time
model (Precup & Sutton, 1997) or equivalently a skill effect model (Kaelbling & Lozano-Pérez, 2017;
Liang et al., 2021) to model the end state after executing a skill. In contrast, we model such dynamics
implicitly by predicting the feasibility between two latent vectors which allows direct optimization
over the sub-goals in a latent space. The most similar to ours is (Nasiriany et al., 2019), which learns
a value function as the implicit dynamics. Our method differs from this work by learning skills from
a trajectory optimizer instead of using RL. Additionally, we encode multiple skills in different neural
networks and perform discrete optimization over the skills for planning."

CONCLUSIONS"
CONCLUSIONS,0.6084905660377359,"In this paper, we propose DiffSkill, a novel framework for learning skill abstraction from differentiable
physics and compose them to solve long-horizontal deformable object manipulations tasks from
sensory observation. We evaluate our model on a series of challenging tasks for sequential dough
manipulation using different tools and demonstrate that it outperforms both reinforcement learning
and standalone differentiable physics solver. We hope our work will be a ﬁrst step towards more
common application of differentiable simulators beyond solving short-horizon tasks."
CONCLUSIONS,0.6132075471698113,"There are a few interesting directions for future work. First, currently DiffSkill uses exhaustive search
for planning over the discrete space. As the planning horizon and the number of skills grow larger
for more complex tasks, exhaustive search quickly becomes infeasible. An interesting direction
is to incorporate a heuristic policy or value function for more efﬁcient planning. Second, similar
to many other data-driven methods, while neural skill abstraction gives good prediction results on
region where a lot of data are available, it performs worse when tested on situations that are more
different from training. This can be remedied by either collecting more diverse training data in
simulation, for example, under an online reinforcement learning framework, or by using a more
structured representation beyond RGBD images, such as using an object-centric representation. Third,
we hope to extend our current results to the real world, by using a more transferrable representation
such as just a depth map or a point-cloud representation. Finally, we hope to see DiffSkill be applied
to other similar tasks, such as those related to cloth manipulation."

COMPARISON WITH MODEL-FREE RL ON SINGLE-TOOL TASKS"
REFERENCES,0.9811320754716981,"In this work, we focus on solving long-horizon multi-tool tasks. But our proposed method is not limitied to the
multi-tool setup. For the single-tool task, or more speciﬁcally the single-skill task, our method can be directly
applied without planning over the discrete space of which tool to use. To show this, we show results on two
single-tool, single-stage tasks: Lift and Spread, which corresponds to the two sub-tasks in LiftSpread, but with
a different initial and target dough shapes. For both environments, only one tool can be used: the spatula for
Lift and the rolling pin for Spread. The results are shown in Table 4. As these are two simpler tasks, DiffSkill
can solve both tasks. SAC can also solve the simpler lift task, but has some trouble learning the spread task.
Visualization of both methods on these environments can be found on our website."
