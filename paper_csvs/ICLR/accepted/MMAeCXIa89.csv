ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0031746031746031746,"Bayesian optimization (BO) has become an established framework and popular
tool for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of machine learning (ML) algorithms.
While known for its sample-efﬁciency, vanilla BO can not utilize readily available
prior beliefs the practitioner has on the potential location of the optimum. Thus, BO
disregards a valuable source of information, reducing its appeal to ML practitioners.
To address this issue, we propose πBO, an acquisition function generalization
which incorporates prior beliefs about the location of the optimum in the form of a
probability distribution, provided by the user. In contrast to previous approaches,
πBO is conceptually simple and can easily be integrated with existing libraries and
many acquisition functions. We provide regret bounds when πBO is applied to
the common Expected Improvement acquisition function and prove convergence
at regular rates independently of the prior. Further, our experiments show that
πBO outperforms competing approaches across a wide suite of benchmarks and
prior characteristics. We also demonstrate that πBO improves on the state-of-the-
art performance for a popular deep learning task, with a 12.5× time-to-accuracy
speedup over prominent BO approaches."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.009523809523809525,"The optimization of expensive black-box functions is a prominent task, arising across a wide range of
applications. Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sample-efﬁcient approach to cope with this task, and
has been successfully applied to various problem settings, including hyperparameter optimization
(HPO) (Snoek et al., 2012), neural architecture search (NAS) (Ru et al., 2021), joint NAS and
HPO (Zimmer et al., 2021), algorithm conﬁguration (Hutter et al., 2011), hardware design (Nardi
et al., 2019), robotics (Calandra et al., 2014), and the game of Go (Chen et al., 2018)."
INTRODUCTION,0.012698412698412698,"Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of BO for HPO (Bergstra et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2021),
its adoption among practitioners remains limited. In a survey covering NeurIPS 2019 and ICLR
2020 (Bouthillier & Varoquaux, 2020), manual search was shown to be the most prevalent tuning
method, with BO accounting for less than 7% of all tuning efforts. As the understanding of hy-
perparameter settings in deep learning (DL) models increase (Smith, 2018), so too does the tuning
proﬁciency of practitioners (Anand et al., 2020). As previously displayed (Smith, 2018; Anand
et al., 2020; Souza et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019), this knowledge manifests in choosing single
conﬁgurations or regions of hyperparameters that presumably yield good results, demonstrating
a belief over the location of the optimum. BO’s deﬁcit to properly incorporate said beliefs is a
reason why practitioners prefer manual search to BO (Wang et al., 2019), despite its documented
shortcomings (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012). To improve the usefulness of automated HPO approaches
for ML practictioners, the ability to incorporate such knowledge is pivotal."

biasing the initial design, or by narrowing the search space; however, this type of hard prior can lead
to poor performance by missing important regions. BO also supports a prior over functions p(f) via"

INTRODUCTION,0.022222222222222223,"the Gaussian Process kernel. However, this option for injecting knowledge is not aligned with the
knowledge that experts possess: they often know which ranges of hyperparameter values tend to
work best (Perrone et al., 2019; Smith, 2018; Wang et al., 2019), and are able to specify a probability
distribution to quantify these priors. For example, many users of the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba,
2015) know that its best learning rate is often in the vicinity of 1 × 10−3. In practice, DL experiments
are typically conducted in a low-budget setting of less than 50 full model trainings (Bouthillier &
Varoquaux, 2020). As such, practitioners want to exploit their knowledge efﬁciently without wasting
early model trainings on conﬁgurations they expect to likely perform poorly. Unfortunately, this suits
standard BO poorly, as BO requires a moderate number of function evaluations to learn about the
response surface and make informed decisions that outperform random search."
INTRODUCTION,0.025396825396825397,"While there is a demand to increase knowledge injection possibilities to further the adoption of BO,
the concept of encoding prior beliefs over the location of an optimum is still rather novel: while
there are some initial works (Ramachandran et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Souza et al., 2021), no
approach exists so far that allows the integration of arbitrary priors and offers ﬂexibility in the choice
of acquisition function; theory is also lacking. We close this gap by introducing a novel, remarkably
simple, approach for injecting arbitrary prior beliefs into BO that is easy to implement, agnostic to
the surrogate model used and converges at standard BO rates for any choice of prior."

functions are Upper Conﬁdence Bound (UCB) (Srinivas et al., 2012), Probability of Improvement
(PI) (Jones, 2001; Kushner, 1964) and Thompson Sampling (TS) (Thompson, 1933). A different
class of acquisition functions is based on non-myopic criteria, such as Entropy Search (Hennig &
Schuler, 2012), Predictive Entropy Search (Hernández-Lobato et al., 2014) and Max-value Entropy
Search (Wang & Jegelka, 2017), which select points to minimize the uncertainty about the optimum,
and the Knowledge Gradient (Frazier et al., 2008), which aims to minimize the posterior mean of the
surrogate at the subsequent iteration. Our work applies to all acquisition functions in the ﬁrst class,
and we leave its extension to those in the second class for future work."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.09841269841269841,"There are two main categories of approaches that exploit prior knowledge in BO: approaches that
use records of previous experiments, and approaches that incorporate assumptions on the black-box
function provided either directly or indirectly by the user. As πBO exploits prior knowledge from
users, we brieﬂy discuss approaches which utilize previous experiments, and then comprehensively
discuss the literature on exploiting expert knowledge."
RELATED WORK,0.10158730158730159,"Learning from Previous Experiments
Transfer learning for BO aims to automatically extract
and use knowledge from prior executions of BO. These executions can come, for example, from
learning and optimizing the hyperparameters of a machine learning algorithm on different datasets
(van Rijn & Hutter, 2018; Swersky et al., 2013; Wistuba et al., 2015; Perrone et al., 2019; Feurer
et al., 2015; 2018), or from optimizing the hyperparameters at different development stages (Stoll
et al., 2020). For a comprehensive overview of meta learning for hyperparameter optimization, please
see the survey from Vanschoren (2018). In contrast to these transfer learning approaches, πBO and
the related work discussed below does not hinge on the existence of previous experiments, and can
therefore be applied more generally."
RELATED WORK,0.10476190476190476,"Incorporating Expert Priors over Function Structure
BO can leverage structural priors on how
the objective function is expected to behave. Traditionally, this is done via the surrogate model’s prior
over functions, e.g., the kernel of the GP. However, there are lines of work that explore additional
structural priors for BO to leverage. For instance, both SMAC (Hutter et al., 2011) and iRace (López-
Ibáñez et al., 2016) support structural priors in the form of log-transformations, Li et al. (2018)
propose to use knowledge about the monotonicity of the objective function as a prior for BO, and
Snoek et al. (2014) model non-stationary covariance between inputs by warping said inputs."
RELATED WORK,0.10793650793650794,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
RELATED WORK,0.1111111111111111,"Oh et al. (2018) and Siivola et al. (2018) both propose structural priors tailored to high-dimensional
problems, addressing the issue of over-exploring the boundary described by Swersky (2017). Oh
et al. (2018) propose a cylindrical kernel that expands the center of the search space and shrinks the
edges, while Siivola et al. (2018) propose adding derivative signs to the edges of the search space to
steer BO towards the center. Lastly, Shahriari et al. (2016a) propose a BO algorithm for unbounded
search spaces which uses a regularizer to penalize points based on their distance to the center of
the user-deﬁned search space. All of these approaches incorporate prior information on speciﬁc
properties of the function or search space, and are thus not always applicable. Moreover, they do not
generally direct the search to desired regions of the search space, offering the user little control over
the selection of points to evaluate."
RELATED WORK,0.11428571428571428,"Incorporating Expert Priors over Function Optimum
Few previous works have proposed to
inject explicit prior distributions over the location of an optimum into BO. In these cases, users
explicitly deﬁne a prior that encodes their beliefs on where the optimum is more likely to be located.
Bergstra et al. (2011) suggest an approach that supports prior beliefs from a ﬁxed set of distributions.
However, this approach cannot be combined with standard acquisition functions. BOPrO (Souza
et al., 2021) employs a similar structure that combines the user-provided prior distribution with a
data-driven model into a pseudo-posterior. From the pseudo-posterior, conﬁgurations are selected
using the EI acquisition function, using the formulation in Bergstra et al. (2011). While BOPrO is
able to recover from misleading priors, its design restricts it to only use EI. Moreover, it does not
provide the convergence guarantees of πBO."
RELATED WORK,0.11746031746031746,"Li et al. (2020) propose to infer a posterior conditioned on both the observed data and the user
prior through repeated Thompson sampling and maximization under the prior. This method displays
robustness against misleading priors but lacks in empirical performance. Additionally, it is restricted
to only one speciﬁc acquisition function. Ramachandran et al. (2020) use the probability integral
transform to warp the search space, stretching high-probability regions and shrinking others. While
the approach is model- and acquisition function agnostic, it requires invertible priors, and does not
empirically display the ability to recover from misleading priors. In Section 4, we demonstrate
that πBO compares favorably for priors over the function optimum, and shows improved empirical
performance. Additionally, we do a complete comparison of all approaches in Appendix C."
RELATED WORK,0.12063492063492064,"In summary, πBO sets itself apart from the methods above by being simpler (and thus easier to
implement in different frameworks), ﬂexible with regard to different acquisition functions and
different surrogate models, the availability of theoretical guarantees, and, as we demonstrate in
Section 4, better empirical results."

in existing BO frameworks and can be combined directly with the myopic acquisition functions
listed above. πBO augments an acquisition function to emphasize promising regions under the prior,
ensuring such regions are to be explored frequently. As optimization progresses, the πBO strategy
increasingly resembles that of vanilla BO, retaining its standard convergence rates (see Section 3.3).
πBO is publicly available as part of the SMAC (https://github.com/automl/SMAC3) and

DECAYING PRIOR-WEIGHTED ACQUISITION FUNCTION,0.14603174603174604,"As the optimization progresses, we should increasingly trust the surrogate model over the prior;
the model improves with data while the user prior remains ﬁxed. This cannot be achieved with the
formulation in Eq. (5), as poorly-chosen priors would permanently slow down the optimization.
Rather, to accomplish this desired behaviour, the inﬂuence of the prior needs to decay over time.
Building on the approaches of Lee et al. (2020) and Souza et al. (2021), we accomplish this by
raising the prior to a power γn ∈R+, which decays towards zero with growing n. Thus, the resulting
prior πn(x) = π(x)γn reﬂects a belief on the location of an optimum that gets weaker with time,
converging towards a uniform distribution. We set γn = β/n, where β ∈R+ is a hyperparameter set
by the user, reﬂecting their conﬁdence in π(x). We provide a sensitivity study on β in Appendix A.

mode. With time, the exponent on the prior will tend to zero, making the prior tend to uniform. Thus,
with increasing n, the point selection of απ,n becomes increasingly similar to that of α. Algorithm 1
displays the simplicity of the new strategy, highlighting the required one-line change (Line 6) in the

RESULTS"
RESULTS,0.2253968253968254,"We empirically demonstrate the efﬁciency of πBO in three different settings. As πBO is a general
method to augment acquisition functions, it can be implemented in different parent BO packages,
and the implementation in any given package inherits the pros and cons of that package. To minimize
confounding factors concerning this choice of parent package, we keep comparisons within the
methods in one package where possible and provide results in the other packages in Appendix C. In
Sec. 4.2, using Spearmint as a parent package, we evaluate πBO against three intuitive baselines to
assess its performance and robustness on priors with different qualities, ranging from very accurate
to purposefully detrimental. To this end, we use toy functions and cheap surrogates, where priors
of known quality can be obtained. Next, in Sec. 4.3, we compare πBO against two competitive
approaches (BOPrO and BOWS) that integrate priors over the optimum similarly to πBO, using
HyperMapper (Nardi et al., 2019) as a parent framework, in which the most competitive baseline
BOPrO is implemented. For these experiments we adopt a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) benchmark
on various datasets, using the interface provided by HPOBench (Eggensperger et al., 2021), with
priors constructed around the defaults provided by the library. Lastly, in Sec. 4.4, we apply πBO
and other approaches to two deep learning tasks, also using priors derived from publicly available
defaults. Further, we demonstrate the ﬂexibility of πBO in Appendix B, where we evaluate πBO in
SMAC (Hutter et al., 2011; Lindauer et al., 2021) with random forests, as another framework with
another surrogate model, and adapt it to use the UCB, TS and PI acquisition functions instead of EI."

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP"
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.23174603174603176,"Priors
For our surrogate and toy function tasks, we follow the prior construction methodology
in BOPrO (Souza et al., 2021) and create three main types of prior qualities, all Gaussian: strong,
weak and wrong. The strong and weak priors are located to have a high and moderate density on
the optimum, respectively. The wrong prior is a narrow distribution located in the worst region
of the search space. For the OpenML MLP tuning benchmark, we utilize the defaults and search
spaces provided in HPOBench (Eggensperger et al., 2021), and construct Gaussian priors for each
hyperparameter with their mean on the default value, and a standard deviation of 25% of the
hyperparameter’s domain. For the DL case studies, we utilize defaults from each task’s repository and,
for numerical hyperparameters, once again set the standard deviation to 25% of the hyperparameter’s
domain. For categorical hyperparameters, we place a higher probability on the default. As such,
the quality of the prior is ultimately unknown, but serves as a proxy for what a practitioner may
choose and has shown to be a reasonable choice (Anastacio & Hoos, 2020). For all experiments,
we run πBO with β = N/10, where N is the total number of iterations, in order to make the prior
inﬂuence approximately equal in all experiments, regardless of the number of allowed BO iterations.
We investigate the sensitivity to β in Appendix A, and the sensitivity to prior quality in Appendix G."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.23492063492063492,"Baselines
We empirically evaluate πBO against the most competitive approaches for priors over
the optimum described in Section 2.3: BOPrO (Souza et al., 2021) and BO in Warped Space
(BOWS) (Ramachandran et al., 2020). To contextualize the performance of πBO, we provide
additional, simpler baselines: random sampling, sampling from the prior and BO with prior-based
initial design. The latter is initialized with the mode of the prior in addition to its regular initial design.
In our main results, we choose Spearmint (with EI) (Snoek et al., 2012) for this mode-initialized
baseline, simply referring to it as Spearmint. See Appendix F for complete details on the experiments."

ROBUSTNESS OF πBO"
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.24126984126984127,"First, we study the robustness of πBO. To this end, we show that πBO beneﬁts from informative
priors and can recover from wrong priors, being consistent with our theoretical results in Section 3.3.
To this end, we consider a well-known black-box optimization function, Branin (2D), as well as two
surrogate HPO tasks from the Profet suite (Klein et al., 2019): FC-Net (6D) and XGBoost (8D). For
these tasks, we exemplarily show results for πBO implemented in the Spearmint framework. As
Figure 2 shows, πBO is able to quickly improve over sampling from the prior. Moreover, it improves
substantially over Spearmint (with mode initialization) for all informative priors, staying up to an
order of magnitude ahead throughout the optimization for both strong and weak priors. For wrong
priors, πBO displays desired robustness by recovering to approximately equal regret as Spearmint. In
contrast, Spearmint frequently fails to substantially improve from its initial design on the strong and"

procedure. This effect is even more pronounced on the higher-dimensional tasks FCNet and XGBoost,
where BO typically spends many iterations at the boundary (Swersky, 2017). Here, πBO rapidly
improves multiple orders of magnitude over the initial design, displaying its ability to efﬁciently
exploit the information provided by the prior."

COMPARISON OF πBO AGAINST OTHER PRIOR-GUIDED APPROACHES"
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.2571428571428571,"Next, we study the performance of πBO against other state-of-the-art prior-guided approaches. To
this end, we consider optimizing 5 hyperparameters of an MLP for classiﬁcation (Eggensperger et al.,
2021) on 6 different OpenML datasets (Vanschoren et al., 2014) and compare against BOPrO (Souza
et al., 2021) and BOWS (Ramachandran et al., 2020). For minimizing confounding factors, we
implement πBO and BOWS in HyperMapper (Nardi et al., 2019), the same framework that BOPrO
runs on. Moreover, we let all approaches share πBO’s initialization procedure. We consider a budget
of 50 iterations as it is common with ML practitioners (Bouthillier & Varoquaux, 2020). In Figure 3,
we see that πBO offers the best performance on four out of six tasks, and displays the most consistent
performance across tasks. In contrast to them BOWS and BOPrO, πBO also comes with theoretical
guarantees and is ﬂexible in the choice of framework and acquisition function."

CASE STUDIES ON DEEP LEARNING PIPELINES,0.2698412698412698,"Last, we study the impact of πBO on deep learning applications, which are often fairly expensive,
making efﬁciency even more important than in HPO for traditional machine learning. To this end, we
consider two deep learning case studies: segmentation of neuronal processes in electron microscopy
images with a U-Net(6D) (Ronneberger et al., 2015), with code provided from the NVIDIA deep
learning examples repository (Przemek et al.), and image classiﬁcation on ImageNette-128 (6D)
(Howard, 2019), a light-weight adaptation of ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), with code from the
repository of the popular FastAI library (Howard et al., 2018). We mimic the setup from Section
4.3 by using the HyperMapper framework and identical initialization procedures across approaches.
Gaussian priors are set on publicly available default values, which are results of previous tuning
efforts of the original authors. We again optimize for a practical budget of 50 iterations (Bouthillier &
Varoquaux, 2020). As test splits for both tasks were not available to us, we report validation scores."

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.28253968253968254,"We presented πBO, a conceptually very simple Bayesian optimization approach for leveraging user
beliefs about the location of an optimum, which relies on a generalization of myopic acquisition
functions. πBO modiﬁes the selection of design points through a decaying weighting scheme,
promoting high-probability regions under the prior. Contrary to previous approaches, πBO imposes
only minor restrictions on the type of priors, surrogates or frameworks that can be used. πBO provably
converges at regular rates, displays state-of-the art performance across tasks, and effectively recovers
from poorly speciﬁed priors. Moreover, we have demonstrated that πBO can yield substantial
performance gains for practical low-budget settings, improving on the state-of-the-art for a real-world
CNN tuning tasks even with trivial choices for the prior. For practitioners who have historically relied
on manual or grid search for HPO, we hope that πBO will serve as an intuitive and effective tool for
bridging the gap between traditional tuning methods and BO."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.2857142857142857,"πBO sets the stage for several follow-up studies. Amongst others, we will examine the extension of
πBO to non-myopic acquisition functions, such as entropy-based methods. Non-myopic acquisition
functions do not ﬁt well in the current πBO framework, as they do not necessarily beneﬁt from evalu-
ating inputs expected to perform well. We will also combine πBO with multi-ﬁdelity optimization
methods to yield even higher speedups, and with multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize
performance and secondary objective functions, such as interpretability or fairness of models."

ETHICS STATEMENT"
ETHICS STATEMENT,0.2984126984126984,"Our work proposes an acquisition function generalization which incorporates prior beliefs about the
location of the optimum into optimization. The approach is foundational and thus will not bring
direct societal or ethical consequences. However, πBO will likely be used in the development of
applications for a wide range of areas and thus indirectly contribute to their impacts on society. In
particular, we envision that πBO will impact a multitude of ﬁelds by allowing ML experts to inject
their knowledge about the location of the optimum into Bayesian Optimization."
ETHICS STATEMENT,0.30158730158730157,"We also note that we intend for πBO to be a tool that allows users to assist Bayesian Optimization
by providing reasonable prior knowledge and beliefs. This process induces user bias into the
optimization, as πBO will inevitably start by optimizing around this prior. As some users may only
be interested in optimizing in the direct neighborhood of their prior, πBO could allow them to do so
if provided with a high β value in relation to the number of iterations. Thus, if improperly speciﬁed,
πBO could serve to reinforce user’s beliefs by providing improved solutions only for the user’s region
of interest. However, if used properly, πBO will reduce the computational resources required to ﬁnd
strong hyperparameter settings, contributing to the sustainability of machine learning."

REPRODUCIBILITY,0.30793650793650795,"In order to make the experiments run in πBO as reproducible as possible, we have included links
to repositories of our implementations in both Spearmint and HyperMapper, with instructions on
how to run our experiments. Moreover, we have included in said repositories all of the exact
priors that we have used for our runs, which run out of the box. The priors we used were, in
our opinion, well motivated as to avoid subjectivity, which we hope serves as a good frame of
reference for similar works in the future. Speciﬁcally, Appendix 4.4 describes how we ran our DL
experiments, Appendix F.1 goes into the implementation in further detail, and Appendix D displays
the exact priors for all our experiments and prior strengths. Our Spearmint implementation of both
πBO and BOWS is available at https://github.com/piboauthors/PiBO-Spearmint,

better than that of Spearmint for good priors. Additionally, there is a clear relationship between ﬁnal
performance and β on all good priors. This is best visualized in the weak XGBoost experiment, where
the ﬁnal performances are distinctly sorted by increasing β. Similar patterns are not as apparent in

RANDOM FOREST SURROGATE"
REFERENCES,0.5936507936507937,"We now demonstrate πBO with a RF surrogate model. In the SMAC implementation of the RF
surrogate, the model forms piece-wise constant mean and covariance functions. Naturally, this leads
to the EI, PI or UCB acquisition function surface being piece-wise constant as well. Consequently, an
acquisition function with a RF surrogate will typically have a region of global optima. The choice of
the next design point is then selected uniformly at random among the candidate optima. We wish to
retain this randomness when applying πBO. As such, we require the prior to be piece-wise constant,
too. To do so, we employ a binning approach, that linearly rounds prior values after applying the decay
term. The granularity of the binning decreases at the same rate as the prior, allowing the piece-wise
constant regions of the prior grow in size as optimization progresses. In Figure 9, we demonstrate
the importance of the piece-wise constant acquisition function by showing the point selection when
applying a πBO with a continuous prior to an RF surrogate (left) and when applying the binning
approach (right). Notably, the smooth prior on the left repeatedly proposes design points very close
to previous points, as the prior forces the selection of points near the boundary of a promising region.
Thus, the surrogate model rarely improves, and the optimization gets stuck at said boundary for
multiple iterations at a time. This is best visualized at iteration 5 and 10, where similar points have
been selected for all iterations in the time span. With the binned prior on the right, the selection of
design points occurs randomly within a region, avoiding the static point selection and updating of
non-modiﬁed approach. In Figure 8, we report the performance of πBO with a RF surrogate and the
binning approach. This approach is competitive, as it provides substantial improvement over SMAC,
improves over sampling from the prior, and quickly recovers from misleading priors. Notably, the
binning is not required for discrete parameters, as the piece-wise constant property holds by default.
Thus, this adaptation is only necessary for continuous parameters."

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ON Cπ,n"

the user. To do so, we consider a typical low-budget setting and display values of Cπ,n at iteration
50. We consider a one-dimensional search space where with a Gaussian prior located in the center
of the search space. In the plot below, we display how the choice of σ, given as a percentage of
the search space, and β, the prior conﬁdence parameter, yield different values of Cπ,n. We see that,
for approximately half of the space, the upper bound on the loss is at least 80% (bright green or
yellow) of the upper bound of EI, and only a small region of very narrow priors (dark blue) give a
low guaranteed convergence rate."

FRAMEWORKS"
REFERENCES,0.8317460317460318,"Our implementations of πBO require little change in the supporting frameworks, Spearmint and
HyperMapper, and we stay as close to the default settings as possible for each framework. For
both Spearmint and HyperMapper, we consider a Matérn 5/2 Kernel. For particularly strong priors,
rounding errors can cause the prior to be zero in parts of the search space, potentially affecting
πBO’s convergence properties. To avoid these rounding errors and ensure a strictly positive prior,
we add a small constant, ϵ = 10−12, to the prior throughout the search space for all prior qualities.
For the initial sampling from the prior, we truncate the distribution by disallowing sampled points
from outside the search space, instead re-sampling such points. During optimization, we do not to
explicitly truncate the prior, as points outside the search space are never considered during acquisition
function maximization. Thus, the prior is effectively truncated to ﬁt the search space without requiring
additional consideration."
REFERENCES,0.834920634920635,"To the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available implementation of BOWS, so we re-
implemented it in Spearmint. For the Spearmint implementation of BOWS, we provide warped
versions of each benchmark, obtaining 20 unique warpings per prior quality and benchmark. We
truncate the prior by restricting the warped search space to only include the region which maps back to
the original search space through the inverted warping function. For all other approaches, we use the
original, publicly available implementations. Notably, the available implementation of Hyperopt TPE
does not support bounded search spaces under our priors; as a compromise, when asked to evaluate
outside the search space we return an empirically obtained maximum on the objective function inside
the search space."
