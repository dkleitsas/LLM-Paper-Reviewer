ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.004201680672268907,"The unravelled nosological relation among diverse types of neuropsychiatric dis-
orders serves as an important precursor in advocating the dimensional approach
to psychiatric classiﬁcation. Leveraging high-dimensional abnormal resting-state
functional connectivity, the crux of mining corresponded nosological relations is
to derive a low-dimensional embedding space that preserves the diagnostic at-
tributes of represented disorders. To accomplish this goal, we seek to exploit
the available diagnostic information in learning the optimal embedding space by
proposing a novel type of conditional variational auto-encoder that incorporates
dual utilisation of diagnostic information. Encouraged by the achieved promising
results in challenging the conventional approaches in low dimensional density es-
timation of synthetic functional connectivity features, we further implement our
approach on two empirical neuropsychiatric neuroimaging datasets and discover
a reliable nosological relation among autism spectrum disorder, major depressive
disorder, and schizophrenia."

NOSOLOGICAL RELATION AMONG NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS"
NOSOLOGICAL RELATION AMONG NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS,0.01680672268907563,"Instead of the traditional discrete, categorical view on nosology of multiple neuropsychological
disorders (Frances, 2009), an alternative dimensional, continuous view, which suggests all mental
illnesses lie along a single low dimensional spectrum (Adam, 2013; Casey et al., 2013; Helzer et al.,
2009), uprises to be a more promising perspective to view the relation among diverse disorders.
Despite its commonplace in the symptom-based clinical domain (Caspi & Mofﬁtt, 2018), it was
not until recently that the ﬁnding of shared genetic components across various neuropsychiatric
disorders (Anttila et al., 2018) offered the ﬁrst computational study to reveal the nosological relation
among various disorders."
NOSOLOGICAL RELATION AMONG NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS,0.02100840336134454,"Aside from the discovered commonalities on the genetic makeup of various disorders, as the resting-
state functional connectivity (FC) has proved itself as a valuable biomarker in distinguishing disorder
patients from healthy controls in a plethora of computational studies (Woodward & Cascio, 2015),
they may also hold great promise for uncovering the complex, continuous relation among differ-
ent neuropsychiatric disorders. Unfortunately, due to their inherent high dimensionality, it poses
a formidable data-analytic challenge in discovering the targeted nosological relation on the high-
dimensional neuropsychiatric FC feature space. Thence, the crux of unveiling the FC informed
nosological relation rests on ﬁnding an optimal low-dimensional embedding space to be informative
of high-dimensional FC feature space."

isation of supervision signals, e.g., diagnostic information, in learning a neural correlate informed
low-dimensional embedding space, which allows us to attain the nosological relation among diverse
disorders."
THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH,0.04201680672268908,"To harness diagnostic information in learning a targeted low-dimensional embedding space, in the
following sections, we chieﬂy propose a novel type of conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE)
to incorporate dual utilisation of this information, which involves regularising the learning of em-
beddings through the introduced implicit clustering effect, and encoding the diagnostic difference
among disorders. Based on the demonstrated empirical superiority of our approach in a simulation
study, we implemented it in mining a consistent nosological relation among three common disorders
across two curated neuropsychiatric FC datasets."

PREVIOUS WORKS"
PREVIOUS WORKS,0.06302521008403361,"Harnessing the extracted brain features, recent efforts in computational psychiatry are largely ac-
knowledged on developing increasingly complicated classiﬁcation models to mine discriminative
features to aid clinical diagnosis (Guo et al., 2017; Heinsfeld et al., 2018) and discovering the sub-
types of a single mental illness via advanced data-driven approaches, e.g., the multi-view clustering
method (Tokuda et al., 2018)."
PREVIOUS WORKS,0.06722689075630252,"Unfortunately, little attention was paid to unveiling complex nosological relations among diverse
types of neuropsychiatric disorders based on brain correlates. Among few attempts, a worth men-
tioned study that shares a similar motivation with ours is the work of Xia et al. (2018), where di-
mensions of psychopathology were closely tied to certain common brain features at the macro level,
e.g., resting-state networks. However, this ﬁnding – in support of the differentiation of disorders on
the brain feature level – reveals little on the nosological relationship among disorders, let alone their
symptom-based methodology, which does not fully harness the essence of brain features."
PREVIOUS WORKS,0.07142857142857142,"Narrowing our focus on prevailing methodological modiﬁcations on VAE, a plethora of variants
ranging from the improved generalisation, e.g., beta-VAE (Burgess et al., 2018), Vamp-VAE (Tom-
czak & Welling, 2018), the diversiﬁed generative process, e.g., EVAE (Bai et al., 2019), Multi-entity
VAE (Nash et al., 2017), the optimised inference (encoding) process, e.g., Info-VAE (Zhao et al.,
2017), the discretised latent space, e.g., vq-VAE (Oord et al., 2017), to the conditional variant and its
recent advents, e.g., a semi-supervised VAE (Kingma et al., 2014), NVAE (Vahdat & Kautz, 2020),
CVAE (Sohn et al., 2015), and the Gaussian mixture VAE (Dilokthanakul et al., 2016). Falling into
the last category, our proposed method can be regarded as a novel type of conditional VAE that
embeds a clustering concept. To interested readers, we attach a detailed methodological comparison
between our approach and mentioned alternative approaches in A.1. Additionally, rather than the
conventional usage in the work of Zhu et al. (2020), our implementation of the contrastive learning
is directly applied in the embedding space instead of the original feature space."

increasing research interest to see whether these two-dimensional features are in agreement with ex-
isting disorder related connectivities in the brain space. For this, harnessing the layer-wise relevance
propagation method (Montavon et al., 2019), we have projected each ’cluster centre’ (the most repre-
sentative feature in each of three clusters) back into the high dimensional FC space, and tentatively
identiﬁed a signiﬁcant connection between Caudate and Cuneus that obtains the highest rele-
vance in discriminating three disorders (MDD, SCZ, ASD) among the overall 9730 FCs. However,
the validity of this preliminary neuroscientiﬁc insight on involved functional connectivity is under
the threat of used nonlinear projections (multiple ReLU connections in both inference and generative
networks), where the isomorphism between the low-dimensional embedding and high-dimensional
FC space is not guaranteed."

type of a disorder or the nosological overlap between two disorders, and the scarcity of high-quality

limitation may be ameliorated through investigating the ﬁner (possibly hierarchical) structure within
low-dimensional embeddings of known phenotypes, whereas the latter one may be tackled by the
future release of the high-quality imaging datasets from the Brain/Minds beyond MRI project (Koike

CONCLUSION,0.4327731092436975,"Unveiling the complex nosological relation among diverse neuropsychiatric disorders with the help
of diagnostic information, we advocate a neural correlate based approach, which targets on deriv-
ing a neural correlate informed low-dimensional embedding space. To learn low-dimensional em-
beddings of neural correlates that preserves the diagnostic attributes, dual utilisation of diagnostic
information that is incorporated in a novel type of conditional VAE, are proposed in this research.
Relying on this method, we discovered a reliable and consistent nosological relation among ASD,
MDD, and SCZ across two curated neuropsychiatric FC datasets."
CONCLUSION,0.4369747899159664,"Undoubtedly, the current approach – at its embryonic stage -- faces several mentioned limitations, a
future approach with enhanced interpretability on the obtained low dimensional embedding space,
and the inclusion of an independent validation dataset should enable us to attain more reliable noso-
logical relations on various neuropsychiatric disorders to encourage the age-old, discrete categorical
view on mental illness to make an exit at a fast pace."

METHODOLOGICAL COMPARISON BETWEEN OUR APPROACH AND ALTERNATIVES"
REFERENCES,0.6890756302521008,"As summarised in following Table 1, the main difference between our approach and NVAE (Vahdat
& Kautz, 2020) lies on the derived hierarchical process in deﬁning the decoding and generative
process. In NVAE, the hierarchical process can be seen in the sequential production of z, i.e., z =
z1, ..., zl; q(z2|x) = q(z2|z1, x). This sequential encoding and decoding procedure allows NVAE
to implement feature combinations from z1 to zl. Differ to NVAE, our hierarchical process focuses
on the conditional generation of the latent variable z from both discrete variable c, and the input x,
i.e., q(c, z|x) ∝q(z|x)q(c|z). More importantly, with a deﬁned categorical prior distribution for
the discrete variable Cat(c|π), π ∈ℜN
+ for p(c), the N groups of z are encouraged to be mutually
independent, i.e., the implicit clustering effect. Such independence is neither the objective nor the
outcome of NVAE approach."
REFERENCES,0.6932773109243697,"The hierarchical process in our inference model entails the conditional chain q(c|z)q(z|x)p(x),
whereas in CVAE (Sohn et al., 2015), such conditional chain is replaced by the conditional den-
sity q(z|x, y). In a similar vein, as illustrated in Table 1, the major distinction of our approach to a
conventional semi-supervised VAE (Kingma et al., 2014) also lies on their differentiated derivations
on inference networks."
REFERENCES,0.6974789915966386,"In regards to different instantiations on graphical models, our approach also differs from the Gaus-
sian mixture VAE on both inference and generative networks. In Gaussian mixture VAE (Dilok-

eration network is p(c, x, w, z) ∝p(x|w, z)p(c|x). Ignoring the Gaussian mixture variable w, the
foregoing networks can be seen as q(x, z|c) ∝q(z|x)q(x|c) and p(x|z)p(c|x). In our networks,
these two processes are deﬁned as q(c|z)q(z|x) and p(x|z)p(z|c), respectively. Aside from these
differences, we acknowledge the explicit modelling of different Gaussian mixtures w, which cannot
