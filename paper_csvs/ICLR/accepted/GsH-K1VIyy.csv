ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.002506265664160401,"To attain higher efﬁciency, the industry has gradually reformed towards application-
speciﬁc hardware accelerators. While such a paradigm shift is already starting to
show promising results, designers need to spend considerable manual effort and
perform large number of time-consuming simulations to ﬁnd accelerators that can
accelerate multiple target applications while obeying design constraints. Moreover,
such a “simulation-driven” approach must be re-run from scratch every time the set
of target applications or design constraints change. An alternative paradigm is to use
a “data-driven”, ofﬂine approach that utilizes logged simulation data, to architect
hardware accelerators, without needing any form of simulations. Such an approach
not only alleviates the need to run time-consuming simulation, but also enables
data reuse and applies even when set of target applications changes. In this paper,
we develop such a data-driven ofﬂine optimization method for designing hardware
accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that enjoys all of these properties. Our approach learns
a conservative, robust estimate of the desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points
and optimizes the design against this estimate without any additional simulator
queries during optimization. PRIME architects accelerators—tailored towards
both single- and multi-applications—improving performance upon stat-of-the-
art simulation-driven methods by about 1.54× and 1.20×, while considerably
reducing the required total simulation time by 93% and 99%, respectively. In
addition, PRIME also architects effective accelerators for unseen applications in a
zero-shot setting, outperforming simulation-based methods by 1.26×."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.007518796992481203,"The death of Moore’s Law [11] and its spiraling effect on the semiconductor industry have driven the
growth of specialized hardware accelerators. These specialized accelerators are tailored to speciﬁc
applications [64, 47, 41, 53]. To design specialized accelerators, designers ﬁrst spend considerable
amounts of time developing simulators that closely model the real accelerator performance, and then
optimize the accelerator using the simulator. While such simulators can automate accelerator design,
this requires a large number of simulator queries for each new design, both in terms of simulation
time and compute requirements, and this cost increases with the size of the design space [65, 53, 25].
Moreover, most of the accelerators in the design space are typically infeasible [25, 64] because of
build errors in silicon or compilation/mapping failures. When the target applications change or a new
application is added, the complete simulation-driven procedure is generally repeated. To make such
approaches efﬁcient and practically viable, designers typically “bake-in” constraints or otherwise
narrow the search space, but such constraints can leave out high-performing solutions [9, 44, 7]."
INTRODUCTION,0.010025062656641603,"An alternate approach, proposed in this work, is to devise a data-driven optimization method that only
utilizes a database of previously tested accelerator designs, annotated with measured performance
metrics, to produce new optimized designs without additional active queries to an explicit silicon
or a cycle-accurate simulator. Such a data-driven approach provides three key beneﬁts: (1) it
signiﬁcantly shortens the recurring cost of running large-scale simulation sweeps, (2) it alleviates
the need to explicitly bake in domain knowledge or search space pruning, and (3) it enables data
re-use by empowering the designer to optimize accelerators for new unseen applications, by the
virtue of effective generalization. While data-driven approaches have shown promising results in"

TPU-style [65], NVDLA-style [42], and ShiDianNao-style [10] accelerators to train a conservative surrogate
model, which is used to design accelerators to meet desired goals and constraints."
INTRODUCTION,0.03007518796992481,"biology [14, 5, 57], using ofﬂine optimization methods to design accelerators has been challenging
primarily due to the abundance of infeasible design points [64, 25]."
INTRODUCTION,0.03258145363408521,"The key contribution of this paper is a data-driven approach, PRIME , to automatically architect high-
performing application-speciﬁc accelerators by using only previously collected ofﬂine data. PRIME
learns a robust surrogate model of the task objective function from an existing ofﬂine dataset, and
ﬁnds high-performing application-speciﬁc accelerators by optimizing the architectural parameters
against this learned surrogate function, as shown in Figure 1. While naïvely learned surrogate
functions usually produces poor-performing, out-of-distribution designs that appear quite optimistic
under the learned surrogate [35, 5, 57]. The robust surrogate in PRIME is explicitly trained to prevent
overestimation on “adversarial” designs that would be found during optimization. Furthermore,
in contrast to prior works that discard infeasible points [25, 57], our proposed method instead
incorporates infeasible points when learning the conservative surrogate by treating them as additional
negative samples. During evaluation, PRIME optimizes the learned conservative surrogate."
INTRODUCTION,0.03508771929824561,"Our results show that PRIME architects hardware accelerators that improve over the best design in the
training dataset, on average, by 2.46× (up to 6.7×) when specializing for a single application. In
this case, PRIME also improves over the best conventional simulator-driven optimization methods
by 1.54× (up to 6.6×). These performance improvements are obtained while reducing the total
simulation time to merely 7% and 1% of that of the simulator-driven methods for single-task
and multi-task optimization, respectively. More importantly, a contextual version of PRIME can
design accelerators that are jointly optimal for a set of nine applications without requiring any
additional domain information. In this challenging setting, PRIME improves over simulator-driven
methods, which tend to scale poorly as more applications are added, by 1.38×. Finally, we show
that the surrogates trained with PRIME on a set of training applications can be readily used to obtain
accelerators for unseen target applications, without any retraining on the new application. Even in this
zero-shot optimization scenario, PRIME outperforms simulator-based methods that require re-training
and active simulation queries by up to 1.67×. In summary, PRIME allows us to effectively address
the shortcomings of simulation-driven approaches, (1) signiﬁcantly reduces the simulation time, (2)
enables data reuse and enjoys generalization properties, and (3) does not require domain-speciﬁc
engineering or search space pruning."

BACKGROUND ON HARDWARE ACCELERATORS
The goal of specialized hardware accelerators—Google TPUs [29, 23], Nvidia GPUs [43], Graph-
Core [21]—is to improve the performance of speciﬁc applications, such as machine learning models.
To design such accelerators, architects typically create a parameterized design and sweep over
parameters using simulation."
BACKGROUND ON HARDWARE ACCELERATORS,0.040100250626566414,"Target hardware accelerators. Our primary evaluation uses an industry-grade and highly param-
eterized template-based accelerator following prior work [65]. This template enables architects to
determine the organization of various components, such as compute units, memory cells, memory,
etc., by searching for these conﬁgurations in a discrete design space. Some ML applications may have
large memory requirements (e.g., large language models [6]) demanding sufﬁcient on-chip memory
resources, while others may beneﬁt from more compute blocks. The hardware design workﬂow
directly selects the values of these parameters. In addition to this accelerator and to further show
the generality of our method to other accelerator design problems, we evaluate two distinct dataﬂow
accelerators with different search spaces, namely NVDLA-style [42] and ShiDianNao-style [10]
from Kao et al. [30] (See Section 6 and Appendix C for a detailed discussion; See Table 6 for results)."

computation ﬂow on our template-based accelerators (Fig-
ure 2) and refer the readers to Appendix C for details on
other accelerators. This template-based accelerator is a 2D
array of processing elements (PEs). Each PE is capable
of performing matrix multiplications in a single instruc-
tion multiple data (SIMD) paradigm [20]. A controller
orchestrates the data transfer (both activations and model
parameters) between off-chip DRAM memory and the on-chip buffers and also reads in and manages
the instructions (e.g. convolution, pooling, etc.) for execution. The computation stages on such
accelerators start by sending a set of activations to the compute lanes, executing them in SIMD
manner, and either storing the partial computation results or ofﬂoading them back into off-chip
memory. Compared to prior works [25, 10, 30], this parameterization is unique—it includes multiple
compute lanes per each PE and enables SIMD execution model within each compute lane—and
yields a distinct accelerator search space accompanied by an end-to-end simulation framework. More

PROBLEM STATEMENT, TRAINING DATA AND EVALUATION PROTOCOL"
BACKGROUND ON HARDWARE ACCELERATORS,0.05764411027568922,"Our template-based parameterization maps the accelerator, denoted as x, to a discrete design space,
x = [x1, x2, · · · , xK], and each xi is a discrete-valued variable representing one component of
the microarchitectural template, as shown in Table 1 (See Appendix C for the description of other
accelerator search spaces studied in our work). A design maybe be infeasible due to various reasons,
such as a compilation failure or the limitations of physical implementation, and we denote the set
of all such feasibility criterion as Feasible(x). The feasibility criterion depends on both the target
software and the underlying hardware, and it is not easy to identify if a given x is infeasible without
explicit simulation. We will require our optimization procedure to not only learn the value of the
objective function but also to learn to navigate through a sea of infeasible solutions to high-performing
feasible solutions x∗satisfying Feasible(x∗) = 1."

design space and evaluated by the hardware simulator. We partition the dataset D into two subsets,
Dfeasible and Dinfeasible. Let f(x) denote the desired objective (e.g., latency, power, etc.) we intend
to optimize over the space of accelerators x. We do not possess functional access to f(x), and
the optimizer can only access f(x) values for accelerators x in the feasible partition of the data,
Dfeasible. For all infeasible accelerators, the simulator does not provide any value of f(x). In addition
to satisfying feasibility, the optimizer must handle explicit constraints on parameters such as area
and power [13]. In our applications, we impose an explicit area constraint, Area(x) ≤α0, though
additional explicit constraints are also possible. To account for different constraints, we formulate
this task as a constrained optimization problem. Formally:"

of feasible accelerators within a sea of infeasible points [41, 53, 17], as visualized in Figure 3 and
Appendix (Figure 12). While some of these infeasible points can be identiﬁed via simple rules (e.g.
estimating chip area usage), most infeasible points correspond to failures during compilation or
hardware simulation. These infeasible points are generally not straightforward to formulate into the
optimization problem and requires simulation [53, 44, 64]."
BACKGROUND ON HARDWARE ACCELERATORS,0.13533834586466165,"Second, the optimization objective can exhibit high sensitivity to small variations in some architecture
parameters (Figure 11b) in some regions of the design space, but remain relatively insensitive in other
parts, resulting in a complex optimization landscape. This suggests that optimization algorithms based
on local parameter updates (e.g., gradient ascent, evolutionary schemes, etc.) may have a challenging
task traversing the nearly ﬂat landscape of the objective, which can lead to poor performance."
BACKGROUND ON HARDWARE ACCELERATORS,0.13784461152882205,"Training dataset. We used an ofﬂine dataset D of (accelerator parameters, latency) via random
sampling from the space of 452M possible accelerator conﬁgurations. Our method is only provided
with a relatively modest set of feasible points (≤8000 points) for training, and these points are the
worst-performing feasible points across the pool of randomly sampled data. This dataset is meant to
reﬂect an easily obtainable and an application-agnostic dataset of accelerators that could have been
generated once and stored to disk, or might come from real physical experiments. We emphasize
that no assumptions or domain knowledge about the application use case was made during dataset
collection. Table 2 depicts the list of target applications, evaluated in this work, includes three
variations of MobileNet [23, 50, 27], three in-house industry-level models for object detection (M4,
M5, M6; names redacted to prevent anonymity violation), a U-net model [48], and two RNN-based
encoder-decoder language models [22, 24, 49, 38]. These applications span the gamut from small
models, such as M6, with only 0.4 MB model parameters that demands less on-chip memory, to the
medium-sized models (≥5 MB), such as MobileNetV3 and M4 models, and large models (≥19 MB),
such as t-RNNs, hence requiring larger on-chip memory."

validate this overestimation hypothesis and ﬁnd it to confound the optimizer in on our problem

confounding the optimizer, we build on COMs [57] and train fθ(x) with an additional term that
explicitly maximizes the function value fθ(x) at unseen x values. Such unseen designs x, where the
learned function fθ(x) is likely to be overestimated, are “negative mined” by running a few iterations

driven approach is that it enables learning powerful surrogates that generalize over the space of
applications, potentially being effective for new unseen application domains. In our experiments, we
evaluate PRIME on designing accelerators for multiple applications denoted as k = 1, · · · , K, jointly
or for a novel unseen application. In this case, we utilized a dataset D = {D1, · · · , DK}, where
each Dk consists of a set of accelerator designs, annotated with the latency value and the feasibility
criterion for a given application k. While there are a few overlapping designs in different parts of
the dataset annotated for different applications, most of the designs only appear in one part. To train
a single conservative surrogate fθ(x) for multiple applications, we extend the training procedure
in Equation 3 to incorporate context vectors ck ∈Rd for various applications driven by a list of
application properties in Table 2. The learned function in this setting is now conditioned on the
context fθ(x, ck). We train fθ via the objective in Equation 3, but in expectation over all the contexts"

we can either optimize the average surrogate across a set of contexts {ci, c2, · · · , cn} to obtain an
accelerator that is optimal for multiple applications simultaneously on an average (“multi-model”
optimization), or optimize this contextual surrogate for a novel context vector, corresponding to
an unseen application (“zero-shot” generalization). In this case, PRIME is not allowed to train on
any data corresponding to this new unseen application. While such zero-shot generalization might
appear surprising at ﬁrst, note that the context vectors are not simply one-hot vectors, but consist of
parameters with semantic information, which the surrogate can generalize over."

optimizers for accelerator design are meta-heuristic/evolutionary optimizers. We therefore choose to
utilize, ﬁreﬂy [62, 63, 39] to optimize our conservative surrogate. This algorithm maintains a set of
optimization candidates (a.k.a. “ﬁreﬂies”) and jointly update them towards regions of low objective
value, while adjusting their relative distances appropriately to ensure multiple high-performing, but
diverse solutions. We discuss additional details in Appendix B.1."
BACKGROUND ON HARDWARE ACCELERATORS,0.22556390977443608,"Cross validation: which model and checkpoint should we evaluate? Similarly to supervised
learning, models trained via Equation 3 can overﬁt, leading to poor solutions. Thus, we require a
procedure to select which hyperparameters and checkpoints should actually be used for the design.
This is crucial, because we cannot arbitrarily evaluate as many models as we want against the simulator.
While effective methods for model selection have been hard to develop in ofﬂine optimization [57, 58],
we devised a simple scheme using a validation set for choosing the values of α and β (Equation 3),
as well as which checkpoint to utilize for generating the design. For each training run, we hold out
the best 20% of the points out of the training set and use them only for cross-validation as follows.
Typical cross-validation strategies in supervised learning involve tracking validation error (or risk),
but since our model is trained conservatively, its predictions may not match the ground truth, making
such validation risk values unsuitable for our use case. Instead, we track Kendall’s ranking correlation
between the predictions of the learned model fθ(xi) and the ground truth values yi (Appendix B)
for the held-out points for each run. We pick values of α, β and the checkpoint that attain the
highest validation ranking correlation. We present the pseudo-code for PRIME (Algorithm 1) and
implementation details in Appendix B.1."

RELATED WORK
Optimizing hardware accelerators has become more important recently. Prior works [45, 28, 56,
41, 8, 34, 4, 3, 25, 60, 61] mainly rely on expensive-to-query hardware simulators to navigate
the search space and/or target single-application accelerators. For example, HyperMapper [41]
targets compiler optimization for FPGAs by continuously interacting with the simulator in a design
space with relatively few infeasible points. Mind Mappings [25], optimizes software mappings to
a ﬁxed hardware provided access to millions of feasible points and throws away infeasible points
during learning. MAGNet [60] uses a combination of pruning heuristics and online Bayesian
optimization to generate accelerators for image classiﬁcation models in a single-application setting.
AutoDNNChip [61] uses two-level online optimization to generate customized accelerators for ASIC
and FPAG platforms. In contrast, PRIME , does not only learn a surrogate using ofﬂine data but can
also leverage information from infeasible points and can work with just a few thousand feasible points.
In addition, we devise a contextual version of PRIME that is effective in designing accelerators that
are jointly optimized for multiple applications, different from prior work. Finally, to our knowledge,
our work, is the ﬁrst to demonstrate generalization to unseen applications for accelerator design,
outperforming state-of-the-art online methods."
RELATED WORK,0.23057644110275688,"A popular approach for solving black-box optimization problems is model-based optimization
(MBO) [55, 51, 54]. Most of these methods fail to scale to high-dimensions, and have been extended
with neural networks [55, 54, 31, 16, 15, 2, 1, 40]. While these methods work well in the active
setting, they are susceptible to out-of-distribution inputs [58] in the ofﬂine, data-driven setting. To
prevent this, ofﬂine MBO methods that constrain the optimizer to the manifold of valid, in-distribution
inputs have been developed Brookes et al. [5], Fannjiang & Listgarten [12], Kumar & Levine [35].
However, modeling the manifold of valid inputs can be challenging for accelerators. PRIME dispenses
with the need for generative modeling, while still avoiding out-of-distribution inputs. PRIME builds
on “conservative” ofﬂine RL and ofﬂine MBO methods that train robust surrogates [36, 57]. However,
unlike these approaches, PRIME can handle constraints by learning from infeasible data and utilizes a
better optimizer (See Appendix Table 7 for a comparison). In addition, while prior works area mostly"

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION,0.2681704260651629,"Enc, respectively). Moreover, perhaps surprisingly, PRIME generates accelerators that are better than
all the online optimization methods in 7/9 domains, and performs on par in several other scenarios
(on average only 6.8% slowdown compared to the best accelerator with online methods in M5 and
M6). These results indicates that ofﬂine optimization of accelerators using PRIME can be more
data-efﬁcient compared to online methods with active simulation queries. To answer Q(2), we
compare the total simulation time of PRIME and the best evolutionary approach from Table 3 on the
MobileNetEdgeTPU domain. On average, not only that PRIME outperforms the best online method
that we evaluate, but also considerably reduces the total simulation time by 93%, as shown in Figure 5.
Even the total simulation time to the ﬁrst occurrence of the ﬁnal design that is eventually returned
by the online methods is about 11× what PRIME requires to ﬁne a better design. This indicates
that data-driven PRIME is much more preferred in terms of the performance-time trade-off. The
fact that our ofﬂine approach PRIME outperforms the online evolutionary method (and also other
state-of-the-art online MBO methods; see Table 8) is surprising, and we suspect this is because online
methods get stuck early-on during optimization, while utilizing ofﬂine data allows us PRIME to ﬁnd
better solutions via generalization (see Appendix B.1.1)."

tency averaged over a set of application domains. As discussed
previously, the training data used does not label a given accel-
erator with latency values corresponding to each application,
and thus, PRIME must extrapolate accurately to estimate the
latency of an accelerator for a context it is not paired with in
the training dataset. This also means that PRIME cannot simply
return the accelerator with the best average latency and must
run non-trivial optimization. We evaluate our method in seven
different scenarios (Table 4), comprising various combinations
of models from Table 2 and under different area constraints,
where the smallest set consists of the three MobileNet variants
and the largest set consists of nine models from image clas-
siﬁcation, object detection, image segmentation, and speech
recognition. This scenario is also especially challenging for online methods since the number of
jointly feasible designs is expected to drop signiﬁcantly as more applications are added. For instance,
for the case of the MobileNet variants, the training dataset only consists of a few (20-30) accelerator
conﬁgurations that are jointly feasible and high-performing (Appendix B.2—Figure 9)."

DISCUSSION
In this work, we present a data-driven ofﬂine optimization method, PRIME to automatically architect
hardware accelerators. Our method learns a conservative surrogate of the objective function by
leveraging infeasible data points to better model the desired objective function of the accelerator
using a one-time collected dataset of accelerators, thereby alleviating the need for time-consuming
simulation. Our results show that, on average, our method outperforms the best designs observed
in the logged data by 2.46× and improves over the best simulator-driven approach by about 1.54×.
In the more challenging setting of designing accelerators jointly optimal for multiple applications
or for new, unseen applications, zero-shot, PRIME outperforms simulator-driven methods by 1.2×,
while reducing the total simulation time by 99%. The efﬁcacy of PRIME highlights the potential for
utilizing the logged ofﬂine data in an accelerator design pipeline. While PRIME outperforms the
online methods we utilize, in principle, a strong online method can be devised by running PRIME in
the inner loop. Our goal is to not advocate that ofﬂine methods must replace online methods, but that
training a strong ofﬂine optimization algorithm on ofﬂine datasets of low-performing designs can be
a highly effective ingredient in hardware accelerator design."

COMPARISON TO OTHER BASELINE METHODS"

COMs method Trabucco et al. [57]. Like several ofﬂine reinforcement learning algorithms [36], our
method, PRIME and COMs are based on the key idea of learning a conservative surrogate of the
desired objective function, such that it does not overestimate the value of unseen data points, which
prevents the optimizer from ﬁnding accelerators that appear promising under the learned model but
are not actually promising under the actual objective. The key differences between our method and
COMs are: (1) PRIME uses an evolutionary optimizer (Opt(·)) for negative sampling compared to
gradient ascent of COMs, which can be vastly beneﬁcial in discrete design spaces as our results show
empirically, (2) PRIME can explicitly learn from infeasible data points provided to the algorithm,
while COMs does not have a mechanism to incorporate the infeasible points into the learning of
surrogate. To further assess the importance of these differences in practice, we run COMs on three
tasks from Table 3, and present a comparison our method, COMs, and Standard method in Table 7.
The “Standard” method represents a surrogate model without utilizing any infeasible points. On
average, PRIME outperforms COMs by 1.17× (up to 1.24× in M6)."

and prior ofﬂine MBO methods based on generative models [35]. We evaluate model inversion
networks (MINs) [35] on our accelerator data.
However, we were unable to train a discrete
objective-conditioned GAN model to 0.5 discriminator accuracy on
our ofﬂine dataset, and often observed a collapse of the discriminator.
As a result, we trained a δ−VAE [46], conditioned on the objective
function (i.e., latency). A standard VAE [33] suffered from posterior
collapse and thus informed our choice of utilizing a δ−VAE. The la-
tent space of a trained objective-conditioned δ−VAE corresponding
to accelerators on a held-out validation dataset (not used for training)
is visualized in the t-SNE plot in the ﬁgure on the right. This is a
2D t-SNE of the accelerators conﬁgurations (§Table 1). The color
of a point denotes the latency value of the corresponding acceler-
ator conﬁguration, partitioned into three bins. Observe that while
we would expect these objective conditioned models to disentangle
accelerators with different objective values in the latent space, the
models we trained did not exhibit such a structure, which will hamper optimization. While our
method PRIME could also beneﬁt from a generative optimizer (i.e., by using a generative optimizer
in place of Opt(·) with a conservative surrogate), we leave it for future work to design effective
generative optimizers on the accelerator manifold."

LEARNED SURROGATE MODEL REUSE FOR ACCELERATOR DESIGN
Extending our results in Table 4, we present another variant of optimizing accelerators jointly
for multiple applications. In that scenario, the learned surrogate model is reused to architect an
accelerator for a subset of applications used for training. We train a contextual conservative surrogate
on the variants of MobileNet (Table 2) as discussed in Section 4, but generated optimized designs
by only optimizing the average surrogate on only two variants of MobileNet (MobileNetEdgeTPU
and MobileNetV2). This tests the ability of our approach PRIME to provide a general contextual
conservative surrogates, that can be trained only once and optimized multiple times with respect to
different subsets of applications. Observe in Table 9, PRIME architects high-performing accelerator

accommodate for the larger memory requirements in t-RNN Dec and t-RNN Enc (See Table 2 Model

compute power in the accelerator. This reduction in the accelerator’s compute power leads to higher
latency for the models with large number of compute operations, namely M5, M6, and U-Net (See
last row in Table 2). M4 is an interesting case where both compute power and on-chip memory is
favored by the model (6.23 MB model parameters and 3,471,920,128 number of compute operations).

DIFFERENT TRAIN AND VALIDATION SPLITS
In the main paper, we used the worst 80% of the feasible points in the training dataset for training
and used the remaining 20% of the points for cross-validation using our strategy based on Kendall’s
rank correlation. In this section, we explore some alternative training-validation split strategies to see
how they impact the results. To do so, we consider two alternative strategies: (1) training on 95% of
the worst designs, validation on top 5% of the designs, and (2) training on the top 80% of the designs
and validation on the worst 20% of the designs. We apply these strategies to MobileNetEdgeTPU,
M6 and t-RNN Enc models from Table 3, and present a comparative evaluation in Table 16 below."
REFERENCES,0.6416040100250626,"Results. As shown in Table 16, we ﬁnd that cross-validating using the best 5% of the points in
the dataset led to a reduced latency (298.50 →273.30) on MobileNetEdgeTPU, and retained the
same performance on M6. However, it increased the latency on t-RNN Enc (130.67 →137.45).
This indicates at the possibility that while top 5% of the datapoints can provide a better signal for
cross-validation in some cases, this might also hurt performance if the size of the 5% dataset becomes
extremely small (as in the case of t-RNN Enc, the total dataset size is much smaller than either
MobileNetEdgeTPU or M6)."

to querying the simulator over the course of training, we can simply utilize the value of the latest

perform hyperparameter tuning for such evolutionary methods is to run the algorithm for multiple
rounds with multiple hyperparameters, however this is compute and time intensive. Therefore, we
adopted a dynamic hyperparameter tuning strategy. Our implementation of the ﬁreﬂy optimizer
tunes hyperparameters by scoring a set of hyperparameters based on its best performance over a
sliding window of T data points. This allows us to adapt to the best hyperparameters on the ﬂy,
within the course of optimization, effectively balancing the number of runs that need to be run in the
simulator and hyperparameter tuning. This dynamic hyperparameter tuning strategy requires some
initial coverage of the hyperparameter space before hyperparameter tuning begins, and therefore,
this tuning begins only after 750 datapoints. After this initial phase, every T = 50 iterations, the
parameters γ and β0 are updated via an evolutionary scoring strategy towards their best value."

quickly in this case (with about 1000 iterations) and the evolutionary method, despite the dynamic
hyperparameter tuning is unable to ﬁnd a better solution. We hypothesize that this is because the
performance of a local optimization method may suffer heavily due to the poor landscape of the
objective function, and it may get stuck if it continuously observes only infeasible points over the
course of optimization."

DETAILS OF ARCHITECTING ACCELERATORS FOR MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS
SIMULTANEOUSLY"
REFERENCES,0.8245614035087719,"Now we will provide details of the tasks from Table 4 where the goal is to architect an accelerator

application. For entries in this context vector that have extremely high magnitudes (e.g., model
parameters and number of compute operations), we normalize the values by the sum of values across
the applications considered to only encode the relative scale, and not the absolute value which is
not required. To better visualize the number of feasible accelerators for joint optimization, Figure 9
show the tSNE plot (raw architecture conﬁgurations are used as input) of high-performing accelerator
conﬁgurations. The blue-colored dots are the jointly feasible accelerators in the combined dataset,
and note that these data points are no more than 20-30 in total. The highlighted red star presents the
best design suggested by PRIME with average latency of 334.70 (Table 4). This indicates that this
contextual, multi-application problem poses a challenge for data-driven methods: these methods need
to produce optimized designs even though very few accelerators are jointly feasible in the combined

change in the optimization objective. This characteristic of the dataset further makes the optimization

this ratio is 5.68e −4 for t-RNN Enc and t-RNN Dec, it is much different ∼0.01 −0.2 for other
models MobileNetEdgeTPU, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, M5, and M6. This means that likely
t-RNN Enc and Dec will require different kinds of accelerators for good performance compared to
the other applications."

surrogate model is likely to ﬁnd optimizers that appear promising under the learned model, but do not actually
attain low-latency values–in our domain, we plot a calibration plot of the top accelerator designs found by
optimizing a naïvely trained standard surrogate model. In the scatter plot, we represent each accelerator as a
point with its x-coordinate equal to the actual latency obtained by running this accelerator design in the simulator
and the y-coordinate equal to the predicted latency under the learned surrogate. Note that for a large chunk of
designs, the predicted latency is much smaller than their actual latency (i.e., these designs lie beneath the y = x
line in the plot above). This means that optimizing designs under a naïve surrogate model is prone to ﬁnding
designs that appear overly promising (i.e., attain lower predicted latency values), but are not actually promising.
This conﬁrms the presence of the overestimation hypothesis on our problem domain."

that PRIME predicts a higher latency (y-axis) compared to the actual latency. This means that PRIME does not
think that accelerators that attain high-latency values under the simulator, are actually good. We also provide a
zoomed-in version of the plot on the right, which shows that there are accelerators do have meaningfully distinct
latency predictions under PRIME. Observe in the zoomed-in plot that the designs that attain small predicted
latencies also perform relatively better under the actual latency compared to the designs that attain larger
predicted latency of ∼14000-16000 under the PRIME surrogate. Optimizing against PRIME is still effective
because optimization just needs relative correctness of values, not absolutely correct latency predictions."

few applications (e.g., four applications in case (1)) can be enough for good performance on all nine
applications. While this set may not be not minimal, it is certainly a much smaller set compared to the
nine applications considered. Adding an RNN application in case (2) increases latency in compared to
case (1), because t-RNN Enc likely admits a very different optimal accelerator compared to the other
applications due to a very different compute/memory ratio, which in turn skews the generalization of
the surrogate learned by PRIME when trained only on this limited set of four applications. However,"

REFERENCES,0.9949874686716792,"Practitioner guidance: The primary practitioner guidance we can conclude here is that the models
used for training must be representative of the overall distribution of the target models that we
want to zero-shot generalize to. Since a number of our applications are compute intensive, we
were able to simply utilize set (1) to attain good performance on all the applications. On the other
hand, in case (2), when the t-RNN Enc application was over-represented – while seven of nine
applications we considered were primarily compute intensive, one out of four applications we used
for training in case (2) were memory intensive – this hurt performance on the overall set. Therefore,
we believe that ensuring that the training subset of applications is adequately aligned with the overall
set of applications in terms of compute/memory ratio statistic is imperative for favorable zero-shot
performance."
REFERENCES,0.9974937343358395,"For a practitioner deciding between zero-shot generalization and additional data collection, it
may make sense to test if the target application admits a similar value of the compute to memory
ratio as an already existing application. If it does, then the practitioner might be able to utilize
the zero-shot generalization, as is indicated with the good performance of case (1), whereas if the
compute/memory ratio is heavily different from any seen application, zero-shot generalization to the
target application may be worse. Finally, making sure that the training applications adequately reﬂect
the compute/memory ratio statistic for the overall target set is important."
