ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0013986013986013986,"We show that the simplest actor-critic method — a linear softmax policy updated
with TD through interaction with a linear MDP, but featuring no explicit regular-
ization or exploration — does not merely find an optimal policy, but moreover
prefers high entropy optimal policies. To demonstrate the strength of this bias, the
algorithm not only has no regularization, no projections, and no exploration like
ϵ-greedy, but is moreover trained on a single trajectory with no resets. The key
consequence of the high entropy bias is that uniform mixing assumptions on the
MDP, which exist in some form in all prior work, can be dropped: the implicit
regularization of the high entropy bias is enough to ensure that all chains mix and
an optimal policy is reached with high probability. As auxiliary contributions,
this work decouples concerns between the actor and critic by writing the actor up-
date as an explicit mirror descent, provides tools to uniformly bound mixing times
within KL balls of policy space, and provides a projection-free TD analysis with
its own implicit bias which can be run from an unmixed starting distribution."

OVERVIEW"
OVERVIEW,0.004195804195804196,"Reinforcement learning methods navigate an environment and seek to maximize their reward (Sut-
ton & Barto, 2018). A key tension is the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation: does a
learner (also called an agent or policy) explore for new high-reward states, or does it exploit the
best states it has already found? This is a sensitive part of RL algorithm design, as it is easy for
methods to become blind to parts of the state space; to combat this, many methods have an explicit
exploration component, for instance the ϵ-greedy method, which forces exploration in all states with
probability ϵ (Sutton & Barto, 2018; Tokic, 2010). Similarly, many methods must use projections
and regularization to smooth their estimates (Williams & Peng, 1991; Mnih et al., 2016; Cen et al.,
2020)."
OVERVIEW,0.005594405594405594,"This work considers actor-critic methods, where a policy (or actor) is updated via the suggestions of
a critic. In this setting, prior work invokes a combination of explicit regularization and exploration
to avoid getting stuck, and makes various fast mixing assumptions to help accurate exploration.
For example, recent work with a single trajectory in the tabular case used both an explicit ϵ-greedy
component and uniform mixing assumptions (Khodadadian et al., 2021), neural actor-critic methods
use a combination of projections and regularization together with various assumptions on mixing
and on the path followed through policy space (Cai et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019), and even direct
analyses of the TD subroutine in our linear MDP setting make use of both projection steps and an
assumption of starting from the stationary distribution (Bhandari et al., 2018)."
OVERVIEW,0.006993006993006993,"Contribution. This work shows that a simple linear actor-critic (cf. Algorithm 1) in a linear MDP
(cf. Assumption 1.3) with a finite but non-tabular state space (cf. Assumption 1.1) finds an ϵ-optimal
policy in poly(1/ϵ) samples, without any explicit exploration or projections in the algorithm and
without any uniform mixing assumptions on the policy space (cf. Theorem 1.4). The algorithm and
analysis avoid both via an implicit bias towards high entropy policies: the actor-critic policy path
never leaves a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence ball of the maximum entropy optimal policy, and
this firstly ensures implicit exploration, and secondly ensures fast mixing. In more detail:"
OVERVIEW,0.008391608391608392,"1. Actor analysis via mirror descent. We write the actor update as an explicit mirror descent.
While on the surface this does not change the method (e.g., in the tabular case, the method
is identical to natural policy gradient (Agarwal et al., 2021b)), it gives a clean optimization
guarantee which carries a KL-based implicit bias consequence for free, and decouples concerns
between the actor and critic.
2. Critic analysis via projection-free sampling tools within KL balls. The preceding mirror
descent component guarantees that we stay within a small KL ball, if the statistical error of the
critic is controlled. Concordantly, our sampling tools guarantee this statistical error is small, if
we stay within a small KL ball. Concretely, we provide useful lemmas that every policy in a KL
ball around the high entropy policy has uniformly upper bounded mixing times, and separately
give a projection-free (implicitly regularized!) analysis of the standard temporal-difference
(TD) update from any starting state (Sutton, 1988), whereas the closest TD analysis in the
literature uses projections and requires the sampling process to be started from the stationary
distribution (Bhandari et al., 2018). The mixing assumptions here contrast in general with prior
work, which either makes explicit use of stationary distributions (Cai et al., 2019; Wang et al.,
2019; Bhandari et al., 2018), or makes uniform mixing assumptions on all policies (Xu et al.,
2020; Khodadadian et al., 2021)."

entropy policy π, which satisfies π(s, ·) = Uniform(As) for every state s, and moreover has a
stationary distribution sπ."
SETTING AND MAIN RESULTS,0.02937062937062937,"To round out this introductory presentation of the actor, the last component is the update: pi+1 :=
pi + bQi and πi+1 := ϕ(pi+1), where bQi is the TD estimate of the Q function, to be discussed
shortly. This update is explicitly a mirror descent or dual averaging update of the policy, where
we use a mirror mapping ϕ to obtain the policy πi+1 from pre-softmax values pi+1. As mentioned
before, this update appears in prior work in the tabular setting with natural policy gradient and
actor-critic (Agarwal et al., 2021b; Khodadadian et al., 2021), and will be related to other methods
in Section 1.2. We will further motivate this update in Section 2."
SETTING AND MAIN RESULTS,0.03076923076923077,"The final assumption and description of the critic are as follows. As will be discussed in Section 2,
the policy becomes optimal if bQi is an accurate estimate of the true Q function. We employ a
standard TD update with no projections or constraints. To guarantee that this linear model of Qi
is accurate, we make a standard linear MDP assumption (Bradtke & Barto, 1996; Melo & Ribeiro,
2007; Jin et al., 2020).
Assumption 1.3. In words, the linear MDP assumption is that the MDP rewards and transitions
are modeled by linear functions. In more detail, for convenience first fix a canonical vector form
for state/action pairs (s, a) ∈Rd×k: let xsa ∈Rdk denote the vector obtained via unrolling the
matrix saT row-wise (whereby vector inner products with xsa match matrix inner products with
saT). The linear MDP assumption is then that there exists a fixed vector y ∈Rdk and a fixed matrix
M ∈Rd×dk so that for any state/action pair xsa and any subsequent state s′ ∈Rd,
E[r | (s, a)] = x

and
E[s′ | (s, a)] = Mxsa.
Lastly, suppose 1/2 ≤∥s∥≤1 for all s ∈S.

SETTING AND MAIN RESULTS,0.032167832167832165,"Though a strong assumption, it is not only common, but note also that since TD must continually
interact with the MDP, then it would have little hope of accuracy if it can not model short-term
MDP dynamics. Indeed, as is shown in Lemma C.3 (but appears in various forms throughout the
literature), Assumption 1.3 implies that the fixed point of the TD update is the true Q function. This
assumption and the closely related compatible linear function approximation assumption will be
discussed in Section 1.2."

trajectory length is tN). This is slower than the 1/ϵ6 given in the only other single-trajectory
analysis in the literature Khodadadian et al. (2021), but by contrast that work makes uniform
mixing assumptions (cf. Khodadadian et al. (2021, Lemma C.1)), requires the tabular setting,
and uses ϵ-greedy for explicit exploration in each iteration.
♢"
SETTING AND MAIN RESULTS,0.06293706293706294,"The proof of Theorem 1.4 and organization of the paper are as follows. After overviews of related
work and notation in Sections 1.2 and 1.3, the first proof component, discussed in Section 2, is the
outer loop of Algorithm 1, namely the update to the policy πi. As discussed before, this part of the
analysis writes the policy update as a mirror descent, and conveniently decouples the suboptimality
error into an actor error, which is handled by standard mirror descent tools and provides the implicit
bias towards high entropy policies, and a critic error, namely the error of the estimated Q function
bQi. The second component, discussed in Section 3, is therefore the TD analysis establishing that
the estimate bQi is accurate, which not only requires an abstract TD guarantee (which, as mentioned,
is projection-free and run from an arbitrary starting state, unlike prior work), but also requires tools
to explicitly bound mixing times, rather than assuming mixing times are bounded."
SETTING AND MAIN RESULTS,0.06433566433566433,"This culminates in the proof of Theorem 1.4, which is sketched at the end of Section 3, and uses
an induction combining the guarantees from the preceding two proof components at all times: it is
established inductively that the next policy πi+1 has high entropy and low suboptimality because
the previous Q function estimates ( bQj)j≤i were accurate, and simultaneously that the next estimate
bQi+1 is accurate because πi+1 has high entropy, which guarantees fast mixing. Section 4 concludes
with some discussion and open problems, and the appendices contain the full proofs."

FURTHER RELATED WORK,0.07132867132867132,"Linear MDPs and compatible function approximation.
The linear MDP assumption (cf. As-
sumption 1.3) is used here to ensure that the TD step accurately estimates the true Q function, and is
a somewhat common assumption in the literature, even when TD is not used (Bradtke & Barto, 1996;
Melo & Ribeiro, 2007; Jin et al., 2020). As an example, the tabular setting satisfies Assumption 1.3,
simply by encoding states as distinct standard basis vectors, namely S := {e1, . . . , e|S|} (Jin et al.,
2020, Example 2.1); moreover, in this tabular setting, the actor update of Algorithm 1 agrees with
NPG (Agarwal et al., 2021b). Interestingly, another common assumption, compatible linear function
approximation, also guarantees our analysis goes through and that Algorithm 1 agrees with NPG,
while being non-tabular in general. In detail, the compatible function approximation setting firstly
requires that the actor update agrees with bQi in a certain sense (which holds in our setting by con-
struction), and secondly that there exists a choice of critic parameters U so that the exact Q function
Qπ can be represented with these parameters (Silver, 2015). If this assumption holds for every pol-
icy πi (and corresponding Qi) encountered in the algorithm, then the policy update of Algorithm 1
agrees with NPG and NAC (this is a standard fact; see for instance Silver (2015), or Agarwal et al.
(2021a, Lemma 13.1)). Additionally, the proofs here also go through under this arguably weaker
assumption: Assumption 1.3 is only used to ensure that TD finds not just a fixed point but the true
Q function (cf. Lemma C.4), which is also guaranteed by the compatibility assumption. However,
since this is an assumption on the trajectory and thus harder to interpret, we prefer Assumption 1.3
which explicitly holds for all possible policies."

A pervasive topic in supervised learning is the
implicit regularization effect of common descent methods; concretely, standard descent methods

The present work makes use of a weak implicit bias, which only prefers smaller norms and does not
necessarily lead to minimal norms; arguably this idea was used in the classical perceptron method
(Novikoff, 1962), but was then shown in linear and shallow network cases of SGD applied to logistic
regression (Ji & Telgarsky, 2018; 2019), which was then generalized to other losses (Shamir, 2020),
and also applied to other settings (Chen et al., 2019). The more well-known strong implicit bias,
namely the convergence to minimum norm solutions, has been observed with exponentially-tailed
losses together with coordinate descent with linear predictors (Zhang & Yu, 2005; Telgarsky, 2013),

the chain is not started from the stationary distribution; dropping the subscript i for convenience
and letting xj+1 and xj denote the vectorized forms of sj+1aT
j+1 and sjaT
j, and similarly letting uj
denote the vectorized form of Uj, notice that xj+1, xj, uj are all statistically dependent. Indeed, even
if xj is sampled from the stationary distribution (which also means xj+1 is distributed according to
the stationary distribution as well), the conditional distribution of xj+1 given xj is not the same as
that of xj! To deal with such issues, the proof chooses a very small step size which ensures the TD
estimate evolves much more slowly than the mixing time of the chain. On a more technical level,
whenever the proof encounters an inner product of the form

xj, uj

considers

uj−k, xj

independent due to fast mixing and the corresponding choice of k."
SAMPLING TOOLS,0.17762237762237762,"A second component of the proof, which removes projection steps from prior work (Bhandari et al.,

left hand side here has not only a bQi −Qi term as promised, but also a norm control ∥bUi −¯Ui∥2; in
fact, this norm control holds for all intermediate TD iterations, and is used throughout the proof to
control many error terms. Just like in the MD analysis, this term is an implicit regularization, and is
how this work avoids the projection step needed in prior work (Bhandari et al., 2018)."

which gives the various mixing constants used throughout the proof (which we need to instantiate
now, before seeing the sequence of policies, to avoid any dependence). With that out of the way,
consider some iteration i, and suppose that for all iterations j < i, we have a handle both on the
TD error, and also a guarantee that we are in a small KL ball around π (specifically, of radius
ln k + 1/(1 −γ)2). The right hand side of the simplified mirror descent bound in Lemma 2.1 only

REFERENCES,0.6783216783216783,"Proof. The structure and primary concerns of the proof are as follows. The main issue is that
uj, xj, xj+1 are statistically dependent; in fact, even in the unlikely but favorable situation that xj is
distributed according to the stationary distribution (sπ, π), the conditional distribution of xj+1 given
xj can still be far from stationary, even though xj+1 without conditioning is again stationary. The
main trick used here is that η is so small relative to the mixing time that uj evolves much more slowly
than xj, and thus any interaction between xj and uj can be replaced with an interaction between xj
and uj−k, which are approximately independent. The structure of the proof then is to first establish
a few deterministic worst-case estimates on the behavior in any consecutive k iterations, and then to
perform an induction from k to N."
