ABSTRACT,0.0,Abstract
ABSTRACT,0.0022271714922048997,"Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit undesirable behaviours, such as
generating untruthful or biased content. Editing their internal representations has
been shown to be effective in mitigating such behaviours on top of the existing
alignment methods. We propose a novel inference-time editing method, namely
spectral editing of activations (SEA), to project the input representations into
directions with maximal covariance with the positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful)
while minimising covariance with the negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinated).
We also extend our method to non-linear editing using feature functions. We run
extensive experiments on benchmarks concerning truthfulness and bias with six
open-source LLMs of different sizes and model families. The results demonstrate
the superiority of SEA in effectiveness, generalisation to similar tasks, as well as
computation and data efficiency. We also show that SEA editing only has a limited
negative impact on other model capabilities.1"

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.0066815144766146995,"While large language models (LLMs) have taken a central place in the development of full-fledged nat-
ural language processing (NLP) applications, there is a fundamental problem that prevents them from
being fully trusted in real-world deployment: LLMs still generate inaccurate or biased information
that does not align with human preferences [25, 20, 22, 45, 33, 21, 7, 10, 29]."

INTRODUCTION,0.017817371937639197,"Previous work suggests that LLMs “know” more than what
they “say” [21, 4]; their internal representations encode rich
state information [35]. In fact, examples of positive and neg-
ative LLM generations tend to define partly separate clusters
within the activation space, as shown in Figure 1. Furthermore,
Li et al. [21] trained a linear probe on the output represen-
tations from a subset of attention heads and achieved 65.1%
accuracy in predicting whether an LLM is hallucinating or
not. Inspired by these observations, we aim to steer LLMs’ be-
haviour (e.g., to generate more truthful or less biased content)
by editing their internal activations."

INTRODUCTION,0.0467706013363029,"Figure 2: An overview of Spectral Editing of Activations (SEA). The method consists of two stages:
(Left) the offline calculation of the editing projections using spectral decomposition with positive,
negative and neutral demonstrations. (Right) the application of the calculated editing projections
during LLM inference, thus manipulating predictions."
INTRODUCTION,0.04899777282850779,"[22, 45]—then transforming the LLM activations during infer-
ence, has recently emerged as a prominent editing technique.
However, most of these methods require an expensive iterative optimisation to find such a target
module. In contrast, we propose a novel training-free method, spectral editing of activations (SEA),
which edits activations by keeping them highly correlated with activations associated with positive
behaviour (e.g., truthful) and decorrelated with negative behaviour (e.g., hallucinated). Our editing
projections can be found with a closed-form spectral decomposition."
INTRODUCTION,0.051224944320712694,"In practice, we first keep track of the LLM activations during inference for several demonstrations.
For a given prompt, we extract the neutral activations for a completion generated by the LLM. We
also collect negative and positive activations for pairs of completions labelled as negative and positive,
respectively. We then apply singular value decomposition (SVD) on the covariance matrices between
the neutral and negative activations and between the neutral and positive activations. We then find the
editing projections that prune highly co-varying directions between the neutral and negative ones
while saving the highly co-varying directions between the neutral and positive ones in the latent
projection space. However, SVD only allows for linear editing. To overcome this limitation, we show
that using an invertible non-linear feature function can perform the editing in a non-linear feature
space and then transform the edited activations back to the original activation space. Finally, when
the LLM is prompted with a new user query at inference time, we use these editing projections to find
a representative of the model’s activations that co-varies the least with the negative demonstrations
and the most with the positive demonstrations, essentially removing the negative information from
the LLM activations while retaining the positive information."
INTRODUCTION,0.053452115812917596,"We conduct our experiments by evaluating two desirable properties of LLMs: truthfulness [23]
and fairness [27]. We observe SEA’s advantages in improving these desirable properties while
maintaining high inference efficiency. For example, applying linear SEA on the 7B LLaMA-2-chat
model improves the MC1 score on TruthfulQA from 36.96 to 39.41 while only slightly increasing the
inference time (+3.67%). Moreover, non-linear SEA enhances the accuracy of the 7B LLaMA-2-chat
model from 43.02 to 56.17 on the BBQ dataset. More broadly, we evaluate SEA in combination with
six distinct LLMs of different sizes and architectures, and observe consistent improvements for both
linear and non-linear SEA. Only 25 demonstrations are sufficient to yield a noticeable improvement
in the model’s truthfulness and fairness, which demonstrates SEA’s data efficiency. We also show that
editing LLMs’ activations using SEA does not degrade other model capabilities such as commonsense
or mathematical reasoning."

Method: Spectral Editing of Activations"
INTRODUCTION,0.05790645879732739,"We turn now to introducing our method for editing LLM activations. We first illustrate the framework
of spectral decomposition to edit the model activations (§2.1). We then detail the preparation (§2.2)
of the model activations for positive and negative demonstrations as well as neutral activations for
calculating the editing projections (§2.3). We finally apply the editing matrices to new LLM queries
(§2.4). An overview of SEA is given in Figure 2."

SPECTRAL DECOMPOSITION FOR EDITING ACTIVATIONS,0.0645879732739421,"are assumed to be column vectors unless specified. We define a demonstration as a (textual) prompt
with a completion. There are three types of demonstrations: negative (a prompt with an undesirable
completion), positive (a prompt with its desirable completion) and neutral (a prompt and a natural
LLM completion). We assume three random vectors: H+, H−, H ∈Rd with mean zero, where H+
(or H−and H) are the last-token activations for a positive (or a negative and a neutral) demonstration.
Our objective is to maximise the covariance between H+ and H, while minimising the covariance
between H−and H. We assume n samples of (H+, H−, H), denoted by (h+(i), h−(i), h(i)) for
i ∈[n]."

SPECTRAL DECOMPOSITION FOR EDITING ACTIVATIONS,0.06904231625835189,"The high-level intuition behind spectral decomposition for editing activation is to use the cross-
covariance between two random activation vectors to search principal directions which maximise
their covariance and project these two variables to those directions. Formally, we identify U ∈Rd×d

to other column vectors in U, V, respectively. We can use SVD on A = UΣV⊤to solve this
maximisation problem and find the needed matrices U and V, where Ui, Vi are the vectors projecting
each feature of HA, HB into the joint space such that they maximally covary, and the squared singular
value along the diagonal matrix Σ (denote the singular values σi = Σii), can be interpreted as the
“importance” of Ui and Vi. Now, we can use the largest or smallest left singular vectors of U as
¯U to project HA, thus using the cross-covariance to find a representation of HA that co-varies the
most or least with HB. Additionally, since U is orthogonal, we can simply use the transpose of ¯U
to project the representation of HA in that joint space back to the original space, ¯
HA = ¯U ¯U⊤HA,
which essentially keeps the maximal or minimal covariance of HA with HB while minimising the
editing, E[∥HA −¯HA∥2], to preserve model performance after editing its activations."

produce (H+, H−, H) by feeding positive and negative demonstrations and prompts to LLMs and

whether the normalised likelihood of all correct answers surpasses the incorrect ones. In the generation
track, we follow Li et al. [21] to train two separate evaluators, GPT-Truth and GPT-Info. Each of
evaluators predicts a score from 0 to 1 indicating the truthfulness and informativeness of a given

Bias"
BIAS,0.22271714922049,"Dataset. We assess the model bias on the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ; Parrish et al. 27), which
is widely adopted in LLM evaluation [18, 31, 2]. BBQ formulates bias evaluation as a question-
answering task, allowing us to easily construct the paired positive and negative demonstrations. BBQ
contains 29,246 questions covering 11 diverse types of common bias. We randomly sampled 5,246
questions for evaluation, and the rest were used for training and validation purposes. We use the
disambiguated version for a more comprehensive evaluation, providing the model with sufficiently
informative contexts. This approach enables us to assess whether the model biases influence its
selection of a correct answer choice. See Appendix M for example demonstrations."
BIAS,0.22494432071269488,"Evaluation Metric. We use accuracy as the main metric in bias evaluation [27]: the model gets credit
for assigning the highest predicted likelihood to the only correct answer. To understand the model’s
behaviour in a more fine-grained way, we rely on the unknown-answer rate to measure the model’s
usefulness: there is always a correct answer that the model should predict in the non-ambiguous
version of BBQ. Hence, the model should never predict the ""unknown"" candidate as its prediction.
We further use two bias-related metrics: 1) bias score [27] measures the frequency of the model
predicting a biased answer when it makes a non-unknown prediction. 2) Stereotypical response rate
measures the percentage of the model’s stereotypical predictions on questions whose gold answer is
anti-stereotypical."
BIAS,0.22717149220489977,"Baselines. While truthfulness assessment methods have been extensively studied, strategies to
alleviate model bias during inference have remained relatively overlooked. Thus, our primary
comparison involves SEA, ICL, and the LoRA-FT baseline. We explore the utility of both linear and
nonlinear SEA in mitigating bias."

TRUTHFULNESS EVALUATION,0.29175946547884185,"Main results. Table 1 illustrates the results of various inference-only techniques aimed at boosting the
performance of a 7B LLaMA-2 model on TruthfulQA. We observe a significant enhancement of the
base LLaMA-2 model when further trained with the conversation-style alignment (LLaMA-2-Chat),
as described in [40]. On the other hand, we do not observe an improvement with LoRA, which
indicates the difficulty in improving a well-trained model with LoRA-style fine-tuning."
TRUTHFULNESS EVALUATION,0.29398663697104677,"In the multiple-choice track, the best result is from our proposed SEA method, which outperforms
ICL by 2.45 and 2.47 points for MC1 and MC2, respectively. In the generation track, SEA has the
better truthfulness compared with ICL and LoRA. The positive improvement is also observed in the
Best-of-N distribution. When compared to alternative approaches, SEA achieves the highest MC1
score while incurring the minimal sacrifice in inference speed when we only modify the last four
layers. SEA has only a 3.67% increase in inference speed, contrasting with the larger increases of
18.78%, 14.29%, and 97.34% for ITI, DoLA, and ICD, respectively. We also highlight the training
efficiency, i.e., computing editing projections, of SEA compared to gradient-based optimisation
methods (e.g., LoRA), an advantage that becomes more significant with an increasing number of
demonstrations."

TruthfulQA to show the positive contribution of each
individual design of SEA. Our first group of analysis
is to only use the positive or negative editing projec-
tion (see Positive Editing Only and Negative Editing
Only in Table 2), rather than combining both edited
activations. However, we observe a significant drop
in both experiments. This observation suggests that
the activations edited with positive and negative pro-
jections may complement each other, compensating for
any information lost during the editing process. This
is because, in the positive projection, we retain the top
K% of covariance information, whereas in the negative
projection, we retain the top (1 −K)% of covariance information as we discussed in §2.3."
TRUTHFULNESS EVALUATION,0.30734966592427615,"Our second group of analysis is to confirm the advantage of using feature normalisation. We alter
the combination of positively and negatively edited activations by simply averaging each neuron’s
activation between the two. We note a decrease in MC1 from 39.41 to 35.86, affirming the impact of
our proposed normalisation technique. One potential explanation for this decline in performance is
that basic averaging might disrupt the correlation between activations, thereby hindering subsequent
layers of the model from processing the edited activations normally."

BIAS EVALUATION,0.33184855233853006,"Main Results. We present the results on BBQ in Figure 3. Similarly to the truthfulness evaluation,
LoRA only marginally improves the accuracy on BBQ. The accuracy enhancement achieved by
linear SEA in BBQ is modest, exhibiting a mere increase of 0.78%. However, this observation may
stem from the inferior separability between positive and negative demonstrations in BBQ within
the activation space, as emerges from Figure 1. Furthermore, we observe significant accuracy
improvements with Φ-SEA incorporating three nonlinear feature functions. The best Φ-SEA with
the squared-exponential feature function resulted in accuracy enhancements of 13.15%. The drops
in unknown-answer rate (27% →8.1%) and bias metrics (bias score: 5.8% →2%; stereotypical
response rate: 54% →42.6%) further prove that the boosted accuracy comes from the improvement
on usefulness and fairness. Detailed accuracy scores across each bias type in BBQ reveal that SEA
yields benefits across all genres of bias, while LoRA results in a decline in Physical_appearance,
Race_ethnicity, Race_x_SES, and Race_x_gender."

GENERALISATION OF EDITING EFFECTS TO SIMILAR TASKS,0.39198218262806234,"SEA’s editing effect can be generalised to other similar tasks. Finally, we observe that the post-
editing improvements can be generalised across new tasks, provided they share some similarities. For
example, we observe a strong improvement of the 7B LLaMA-2-Chat model in ToxiGen in Table 4,
after projecting the activations towards the less biased directions."
GENERALISATION OF EDITING EFFECTS TO SIMILAR TASKS,0.39420935412026725,"We further assess all SEA methods using BBQ’s demonstrations on the CrowS-Pairs dataset [26],
which evaluates a model’s propensity to generate biased outputs (Table 5). We report the percentage
of stereotypical sentences rated as more likely than non-stereotypical ones, where a lower percentage
indicates less bias. Results demonstrate that both SEA variants effectively reduce model bias across
most categories, with Φ-SEA notably decreasing the generation of stereotypical sentences by 7%."

SPECTRAL ANALYSIS FOR THE SOURCE OF MODEL BEHAVIOURS,0.40757238307349664,"We now present an analysis to substantiate why editing the top-L layers proves to be more precise
compared to other editing schemes, such as the bottom-L layers. We follow [11, 46, 47] which
proposed interpreting the signature as the sum of singular values resulting from an SVD of the
cross-covariance for two variables, indicating the degree of correlation between them. We extend this
to identify which layers’ activations contain the most information regarding the model’s behaviour.
The calculation of the signature value is in Appendix A."
SPECTRAL ANALYSIS FOR THE SOURCE OF MODEL BEHAVIOURS,0.40979955456570155,"In Figure 5, we depict the layer-wise normalised signatures of various LLMs calculated on HaluEval.
Most LLMs exhibit a trend where the top layers contain the truthfulness information, aligning with
recent findings suggesting that bottom layers capture fundamental linguistic features, while top layers
contribute to high-level tasks [47]. However, Gemma stands out, as both bottom and top layers hold
significant truthfulness-related information. This suggests that LLMs, possibly due to variations in
data mixtures, may distribute truthfulness information across layers differently."
SPECTRAL ANALYSIS FOR THE SOURCE OF MODEL BEHAVIOURS,0.41202672605790647,"To the same end, we also conduct an ablation, reported in Table 2. Comparing settings exclusively
editing the top three layers with those editing the bottom three layers, we find that the first yields
superior performance. We also find an advantage in editing more top layers, which is in line with the
exponential trend we observe for LLaMA-2-Chat-7B in Figure 5."

Related Work"
RELATED WORK,0.41648106904231624,"Modifying the activations of a trained model, thus altering the model’s behaviour [30, 16, 24, 49, 6, 44]
or internal knowledge [9], represents a lightweight method to control the model’s generation. Li et al.
[21] probes LLM’s attention heads which are accountable for hallucinations, then edits activations
toward truthful directions. Another way is extracting latent vectors directly from the trained model
and leveraging these vectors to regulate the model’s inference [41, 37, 32, 49]. Recently, Singh et al.
[35] demonstrated the efficacy of fitting an optimal transport from negative to positive activations to
facilitate effective non-linear editing. Activation editing finds application in decoding as well, either
by contrasting activations from various layers [7] or by using a weaker model to edit activations
from a stronger model [22, 45]. Distinct with previous works that use probing [21], contrasting
activations [6, 49, 45, 22], or optimal transfer [35], we use the covariance information to find the
editing directions for LLM’s activations."

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.4209354120267261,"We present SEA, a new training-free activation editing method. This is aimed at guiding LLMs
to generate desirable outputs through spectral decomposition. Our findings indicate that linear
SEA yields improvements in truthfulness and bias over several baselines while imposing minimal
additional computation overheads. We also extend SEA to incorporate non-linear capabilities through
feature functions and their pseudo-inverse. An intriguing property of our method is that it can leverage
an increased number of demonstrations without being constrained by context length. Finally, we
establish that our approach generalises across LLMs of varying model sizes and families, without
incurring degradation of other LLM capabilities."

of noise in the positive demonstrations, also diminishing performance by reducing task-related

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations."

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8797327394209354,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results."

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.

generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
