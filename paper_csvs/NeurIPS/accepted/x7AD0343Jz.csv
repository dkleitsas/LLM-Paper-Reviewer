ABSTRACT,0.0017921146953405018,"We analyze the capabilities of Transformer language models in learning com-
positional discrete tasks. To this end, we evaluate training LLaMA models and
prompting GPT-4 and Gemini on four tasks demanding to learn a composition
of several discrete sub-tasks. In particular, we measure how well these mod-
els can reuse primitives observable in the sub-tasks to learn the composition
task. Our results indicate that compositional learning in state-of-the-art Trans-
former language models is highly sample inefficient: LLaMA requires more data
samples than relearning all sub-tasks from scratch to learn the compositional
task; in-context prompting with few samples is unreliable and fails at executing
the sub-tasks or correcting the errors in multi-round code generation. Further,
by leveraging complexity theory, we support these findings with a theoretical
analysis focused on the sample inefficiency of gradient descent in memorizing
feedforward models. We open source our code at https://github.com/IBM/

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.005376344086021506,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to perform well on natural language generation
tasks [1, 2], they exhibit failures on reasoning [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], mathematics [11, 12], causal
inference [13, 14, 15], and algorithmic tasks [16, 17, 18]. Many interesting algorithmic tasks rely
on function composition, which is an act of combining simple functions (e.g., primitive sub-tasks)
to build more complicated ones. In this paper, we dive into the question of how sample-efficient
Transformer-based [19] language models are when learning to compose as well as to decompose
algorithmic procedures. We empirically approach the aforementioned question by analyzing the
performance of Transformer language models on a set of compositional algorithmic tasks. Given that
a Transformer language model has enough samples to learn all primitive sub-tasks, we define four
hypotheses on how well it learns the composition task within the same training routine:"

the samples needed to learn every sub-task.
H4. A Transformer language model needs more data samples than in H3."
INTRODUCTION,0.014336917562724014,This paper makes the following main contributions:
INTRODUCTION,0.016129032258064516,"• In Section 3, we introduce a family of two new algorithmic tasks with a compositional structure
that is well-suited for creating systematic sub-tasks and testing compositionality. We specifically
design these synthetic tasks with independently observable sub-tasks such that the composition is
easily inferable from the sub-tasks but harder to learn from scratch.
• In Section 4, we train LLaMA models [2] on this family of the tasks as well as two tasks investigated
by Dziri et al. [16]. We ensure that all necessary sub-tasks are learned and test how efficiently the
models can learn their compositional re-combinations. We show that training LLaMA models from
scratch fails to compose all learned sub-tasks under hypotheses H2 and H3, making H4 the most
plausible hypothesis for all four tasks. Furthermore, we propose a formal bound, showing that
current supervised gradient descent training fails in compositional learning in the limit.
• In Section 5, we investigate GPT-4 and Gemini on all tasks and observe their failures to perform the
tasks, or multi-round code generation, with task description and various chain-of-thought examples.
This shows that in-context learning with few samples is unreliable and fails to compose knowledge
from sub-tasks and that H1 does not hold for the investigated tasks."

Preliminaries"
PRELIMINARIES,0.01971326164874552,"Computational graph Let A be a deterministic algorithm and let FA be a set of deterministic
primitive operations that can be used by A during execution. Given an input x, we define the
computational graph for the algorithm A as GA(x) = (V, E). GA(x) is a weakly connected, directed
acyclic graph. The nodes v ∈V represent all intermediate variables’ values during A’s execution,
while the edges e ∈E represent the function arguments involved in the computation of their target
nodes. One source node s describes the input x, while the (single) sink node t represents the output
A(x) = t. For every non-source node v, op(v) ∈FA denotes the operation applied to compute v.
Figure 1 shows an example with a toy input for one of the tasks (PEN) later introduced in Section 3."
PRELIMINARIES,0.021505376344086023,"Sub-task definition While Dziri et al. [16] define one sub-task for each operation occurring in the
nodes of GA(x), we relax this constraint and also consider sub-tasks composed of multiple operations
from FA. However, we require every operation in the set of primitives FA to be independently
observable. Given the set S of all the defined sub-task graphs, we say that an operation f = op(v) is
independently observable in a sub-task graph G′
A(x) if either:"

PRELIMINARIES,0.026881720430107527,"By using this constraint on the definition of the sub-tasks, we aim to achieve a middle-ground between
completely synthetic settings (where each primitive is presented in isolation) and real-world settings
(where the primitives are often grouped and correlated)."

Probing compositionality with algorithmic tasks"
PROBING COMPOSITIONALITY WITH ALGORITHMIC TASKS,0.03942652329749104,"Pointer execution tasks are a family of algorithmic tasks initially proposed to benchmark the gen-
eralization capabilities of deep learning models [20]. They are designed to limit the number of
confounders in the data and force the model to learn an algorithmic (general) solution, making
solving the task with statistical shortcuts impossible. Furthermore, being algorithmic tasks, they
are particularly suited for testing compositional learning, as they can be naturally decomposed into
atomic operations. Hence, the introduction of this family of tasks would allow operating in a fully
controlled environment, limiting the impact of exogenous factors on the empirical observations while
having the possibility to stress-test compositionality."
PROBING COMPOSITIONALITY WITH ALGORITHMIC TASKS,0.04121863799283154,"Motivated by these premises, we introduce two novel pointer execution tasks for testing compositional
learning, Pointer Execution’s neighbor (PEN) and Pointer Execution Reverse Multicount (PERM).
To ensure the validity of our empirical evaluation, we then further extend our experiments to two
well-established tasks for testing compositionality in Transformer-based language models, Highest
Subsequence Sum (HSS) and Multiplication (MUL) [16]. We decompose each task in a set of
sub-tasks S, such that every primitive operation of the task is independently observable in at least
one sub-task. A more detailed exposition of the properties of S is included in Appendix B.1."

Pointer execution’s neighbor (PEN)"
PROBING COMPOSITIONALITY WITH ALGORITHMIC TASKS,0.044802867383512544,"We introduce the Pointer Execution’s neighbor (PEN) task, where the goal is to jump between
different words in the sequence according to a matching criterion while outputting the right neighbors
of the matched words. This task is inspired by C-PVR, a task recently introduced by Abnar et al. [17]
and itself based on the Pointer Value Retrieval task [20]. A sketch of the task is shown in Figure 2
(left). We identify three primitive operations to be left (get the green left neighbor), match (get
the matching green word), and right (get the right yellow neighbor). We, therefore, split PEN into
three sub-tasks that guarantee independent observability for each primitive: copy (Cpy), where the
solver has to copy an input sequence of words (making the right primitive observable); reverse
copy (RCpy), where the solver has to copy an input sequence of words in the reversed order (i.e. the
last word first, making the left primitive observable); Pointer Execution (PE), where the solver has
to match words in a sequence (making the match primitive observable). Additionally, we define
the sub-task Pointer Execution Verbose (PEV) to facilitate the learning of the task. PEV requires
solving the same problem as PEN with the addition of outputting both the matching words and their
neighbors, making it less abstract (see Figure 2). More details on PEN can be found in Appendix B.2."
PROBING COMPOSITIONALITY WITH ALGORITHMIC TASKS,0.04659498207885305,"To make the task more challenging, we add “attention traps” to the input sequences. These traps add
spurious matches between neighboring (yellow) tokens (two spurious matches per yellow neighbor),
such that the model could be tricked into matching the wrong sequence of tokens (yellow instead of
green). An example of this kind of trapping mechanism is included in Figure 2 (left column), and in
a more explicit visualization in Figure B.5. The traps are not added to the main (green) tokens, where
the sequence of matches is always deterministic."

Pointer execution reverse multicount (PERM)"
PROBING COMPOSITIONALITY WITH ALGORITHMIC TASKS,0.05017921146953405,"We introduce the Pointer Execution Reverse Multicount (PERM) task. This task is conceptually
similar to the PEN task. However, instead of matching forward and predicting the current word (or
its neighbor), the solver has to output the reversed matched sequence. To increase the difficulty of
the task, we enrich it with additional operations on the indices. In particular, for each element in the
matched sequence, the solver needs to collect the number of matches and the number of left matches
up to that point, multiply them, and output the result. A visualization of the task is presented in
Figure 2. We omit attention traps because there are no longer neighbor tokens in the input sequence."

(reverse a sequence), and multicount (indexes operations, which includes counting the number of
matches and left matches, as well as multiplying the two counts together). The primitives left and
right are no longer needed, as we drop the concept of neighbors in this task. To make every primitive
independently observable and learn PERM, we formulate three sub-tasks: Pointer Execution (PE),
inherited from PEN; Pointer Execution Reverse (PER), where the solver has to match a sequence

Our matching criterion is that the two end characters of the current word are equal to the first two characters of
the matched word. By ensuring that there are no ambiguities in the input string, an attention mechanism can find
the match by retrieving the last two characters of the word and matching it with the (unique) word that starts
with them. Right: The Pointer Execution Reverse Multicount (PERM), together with the Pointer Execution (PE)

a single sub-task, the Subsequence Sum Execution (SSE) sub-task, to make the primitive dp_step

[16] use this task to find that LLMs do not generalize well to out-of-domain computation graph
depth and width. We identify two main primitive operations: digit_mul (digit multiplication
between a number in base 10 and a digit) and add (addition between numbers). We then formulate
two corresponding sub-tasks to guarantee that each one of these operations is observable: digit-
multiplication (MUL), where the solver has to solve multiplications between a number in base 10 and
a digit (making digit_mul observable) and addition (ADD), where the solver has to add numbers

Training LLaMA models for testing compositionality"
TRAINING LLAMA MODELS FOR TESTING COMPOSITIONALITY,0.08422939068100359,"In this section, we investigate compositional learning on the tasks presented in Section 3. For each
one of them, we encode its multiple sub-tasks by adding unique identifiers at the beginning of
the samples. We then train a LLaMA model from scratch on all sub-tasks concurrently (sampling
from them uniformly at random). We use a character tokenizer and apply cross-entropy loss on all
tokens, including both the input and the output sequences, as is usual in autoregressive language
modeling. Computing the loss only on the answer part, as done in other works [23, 24], led to worse
results in our experiments. We consider an algorithmic task to be learned only when (almost) perfect
in-distribution accuracy is achieved. Any solution resulting in lower accuracy is, on the other hand,
considered wrong, as it fails to fully capture the operations of the algorithm underlying the task.
We conducted additional ablations on the model architecture (e.g., a LLaMa architectural variation
based on Universal Transformer [17]), included in Appendix C.5. However, the unsatisfactory results
deterred us from conducting further systematic analysis on it."
TRAINING LLAMA MODELS FOR TESTING COMPOSITIONALITY,0.08602150537634409,"Learning the PEN task. We train LLaMA with all four sub-tasks (Cpy, RCpy, PE, PEV) and PEN.
As shown in Figure 3 (detailed numbers are in Table C.2), the model successfully learns all the
sub-tasks containing the primitives needed for PEN. However, it fails to properly compose them for
solving the task under hypotheses H2 (no. of samples needed for the most difficult sub-task) and H3
(no. of samples needed for relearning all sub-tasks). Increasing the sample size to 1000 K (roughly
10× more compared to the sum of the samples needed to learn each sub-task independently) allows
the model to learn the PEN task. This makes hypothesis H4 (a Transformer language model needs
more data samples than the sum of samples needed for re-learning all sub-tasks separately) the most
plausible."
TRAINING LLAMA MODELS FOR TESTING COMPOSITIONALITY,0.08781362007168458,"Furthermore, by training the model on PEN only (without the sub-tasks), we observe that LLaMA
obtains no significant benefit from learning the sub-tasks (see w/o sub-tasks vs. w/ sub-tasks in Figure
3). Based on these results, we speculate that the sub-tasks are not properly reused, and the tasks are
rather learned every time from scratch. We interpret this as evidence that the model is not learning
the task compositionally."
TRAINING LLAMA MODELS FOR TESTING COMPOSITIONALITY,0.08960573476702509,"To set those results into context: our dataset of 1000 K samples overall has roughly 6× more tokens
than the number of words a typical 13-year-old would have heard in their life [25]. Furthermore, we
can train a discrete hill-climbing learning algorithm containing 121 discrete parameters to perfectly
learn the PEN task from a single sample, given the sub-tasks as primitives (see Appendix C.2)."
TRAINING LLAMA MODELS FOR TESTING COMPOSITIONALITY,0.0913978494623656,"We also propose an ablation with a smaller model (28 M instead of 150 M parameters, “aux. loss” in
Figure 3, and more detailed Table C.3). We add two additional prediction heads after a fraction of
1/2 and 3/4 of the layers, respectively, and train them using auxiliary losses. The first loss is used to
train the first head to predict, at step i, the i-th (yellow) element of the answer. The second loss is
used to train the second head to predict the (green) element to the left of the one predicted by the
first head. The auxiliary losses model can learn PEN with 300 K samples, while the bigger LLaMA
(150 M) obtains 0% accuracy with the same dataset size. However, this result also falls into the H4
hypothesis."
TRAINING LLAMA MODELS FOR TESTING COMPOSITIONALITY,0.0931899641577061,"Learning the PERM task. We train LLaMA models on the PERM task together with its sub-tasks
(PE, PER, and PEM). The training setting used to train the model on this task is identical to the
one used for PEN. As reported in Figure 3 (and with more detail in Table C.4), LLaMA can learn
with perfect accuracy all the individual sub-tasks but fails to learn their composition (PERM) within
hypotheses H2, and H3. To achieve perfect accuracy, we need to scale up the dataset size by almost
one order of magnitude compared to the H3 setting (the required number of training samples is equal
to the sum of the training samples of all the sub-task datasets). This provides evidence that hypothesis
H4 is the most plausible for PERM too. As for PEN, we study the impact of providing the sub-tasks
together with the main task during training. Comparing the performance of LLaMA when given the
sub-tasks and not (cf. Figure 3 top right), we observe that LLaMA seems to not benefit significantly
from the sub-tasks. We speculate that also in this case this is a sign that the model is not re-using the

TESTING DECOMPOSITION BY LEARNING SUB-TASKS FROM A PRE-TRAINED LLAMA MODEL,0.15412186379928317,"We additionally evaluate LLaMA’s abilities on decompositionality, i.e., learning a sub-task like PEV
after being trained only on the full compositional task (PEN). We observe that, when learning the
decomposition task, the models benefit from being previously pre-trained on the composition task
(see Table C.10). However, to get maximum accuracy on decomposing PEV from PEN, we need
between 25 K and 50 K samples to fine-tune a PEN-pretrained model. This is a significant fraction of
the data to learn the PEV task from scratch, making H1 also implausible for decompositionality on
the PEN task. Similar observations hold for decomposing PE from PERM (i.e., a PERM-pretrained
model fine-tuned on the PE task; see Table C.11). We speculate that this might be an indication
that the model does learn operations relevant for the sub-tasks when trained only on the composite
task (since learning the decomposition gets easier), and the learned solution might be to some extent
compositional, even if the learning process is not compositional (and very inefficient)."

Asymptotic limitations on compositional learning"
ASYMPTOTIC LIMITATIONS ON COMPOSITIONAL LEARNING,0.15770609318996415,"In general, compositional learning can be split into two skills: (1) identifying and learning the
primitives from the sub-tasks, and (2) assembling the learned primitives in the correct way to
construct the solution to the composition task. In Appendix A we focus on (2) and enrich our
empirical results with a theoretical perspective; a gist of it is included in the following paragraphs."
ASYMPTOTIC LIMITATIONS ON COMPOSITIONAL LEARNING,0.15949820788530467,"Pre-training LLMs is sample inefficient in compositional learning. We prove that asymptotically,
meaning from an unknown size onwards, feedforward models on gradient descent are data ineffi-
cient on combinatorial (including compositional) problems. We use a reduction over the required
asymptotic compute time to prove the following result.
Theorem 4.1 (Informal Theorem A.7). There exist (many) series of train-test datasets, such that
feedforward models on gradient descent that memorize samples will need O(nk) times more data
than an optimal learner. Otherwise, they will not generalize to the test set. k is any positive number
and n is the index in the series."
ASYMPTOTIC LIMITATIONS ON COMPOSITIONAL LEARNING,0.16129032258064516,"Proof sketch. Many combinatorial problems are assumed to be hard to solve. NP hard problems
provide an extreme case, where under the P ̸= NP assumption the solution algorithm requires
more than polynomial time. By constructing a train and test dataset where the problem instance of
a combinatorial problem (e.g., SAT) is in the training set and the solution can easily be extracted
from the labels of the test set, we can make the following reduction: if the learning algorithm
finishes in polynomial time, then it cannot answer the test samples correctly, as this would build
an algorithm which can solve the problem faster than possible. If our learning algorithm, however,
tends to memorize the training set fast and, after memorization, training does not improve model test
performance anymore, we can conclude that many samples will be needed to be able to generalize
to the test set. At the same time, we can simulate a slow but data-efficient algorithm that extracts
the problem instance from the training data, computes the answer, and naturally generalizes it to
the test set. The same reduction applies to non-NP-hard problems, in which case the k in Theorem
4.1 becomes bounded. While the classical reduction requires an out-of-distribution test set, the
reduction can be made in the in-distribution case as well using hardness assumptions from public key
cryptography (shown in Theorem A.9)."

Compositional learning via in-context prompting"
COMPOSITIONAL LEARNING VIA IN-CONTEXT PROMPTING,0.16487455197132617,"In this section, we investigate the performance of pre-trained LLMs, GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro, on the
PEN and PERM tasks with various prompting methods. Concretely, we operate under the assumption
that the models have learned to execute a sufficient set of operations during pre-training, and we test
whether these latent abilities can be utilized to accurately solve the tasks given prompts of various
complexitites. We experiment with a wide range of prompts, ranging from simple few-shot examples
to state-of-the-art methods [26, 27, 28]. Besides the task test accuracy, we also report two partial
correctness metrics, match accuracy and termination accuracy. Match accuracy measures how many
steps in the output were a correct left-match-right step, regardless of the last word being correct."

GPT-4 and Gemini prompting on PEN and PERM"
COMPOSITIONAL LEARNING VIA IN-CONTEXT PROMPTING,0.17025089605734767,"Prompting to solve PEN. We first provide the models with simple few-shot prompts demonstrating
eight input-output examples for the task. The exact format is shown in Figure D.16. We find that this is
not sufficient to obtain non-zero task accuracy. We then prepend a natural language description of the
task to the few-shot prompt as shown in Figure D.17, but we find that this does not change the scores
in any significant way. We proceed further by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [26].
The prompt now consists of a high-level description of the task, eight input-output examples, and a
request for the model to perform the task step-by-step (Figure D.18). With this prompting method,
the models still exhibit zero task accuracy. We perform a similar experiment using a more recent and
advanced CoT query, analogical CoT [28], which prompts the model to generate its own few-shot
examples by asking it to recall several examples of similar algorithmic problems it has been exposed
to during training (Figure D.19). This still does not help us achieve non-zero task accuracy."

the first approach (Few-shot CoT, Figure D.20), the few-shot examples demonstrate each step in the
pointer matching procedure alongside with the corresponding outputs (right neighbors) at each step.
In the second approach (Sub-task CoT, Figure D.21), the few-shot examples consist of two phases:
first, we match the entire sequence given an initial input, and then we output the right neighbors
of the elements of the previously matched sequence. While none of the two approaches achieve
non-zero task accuracy, sub-task CoT prompts induce a higher match accuracy in the Gemini-Pro

hints, few-shot CoT, task description, and without double traps (single only), both GPT-4 and Gemini fail on
PEN (0% task accuracy). On PERM, the trend is similar and the main obstacle is multi-counting correctly (cf.
the high match accuracy in the last two rows). GPT-4 reaches 42% task accuracy with a hand-crafted sub-task
CoT. Gemini-Pro reaches to 9% in this setting."

within chain of thought."
COMPOSITIONAL LEARNING VIA IN-CONTEXT PROMPTING,0.2078853046594982,"We also ablate on the newly available o1-preview model from OpenAI. While it cannot infer the

and the results are consistent with the observations on the PEN task. The results are shown in Table 1.
When asked for CoT, GPT-4 does not find a good way to calculate the numbers for each word and
tries to determine directly whether a match is to the left or not, something it seemingly has trouble
doing. The best performing method is “Sub-task CoT” (Figure D.22). In this method, we begin by
explicitly enumerating all of the words. With this, a left match can be determined by comparing
two numbers. We conclude the few-shot examples with an explicit computation of the multicount
numbers. This format increases the GPT-4 task accuracy to 42%, which is significantly higher (by
29%) than all of the other results. However, this setting deviates from identifying and leveraging the
compositional structure of the tasks, since it rather corresponds to executing a hand-crafted algorithm.
Based on the presented results, we can conclude that on the investigated example compositions,
in-context learning with few samples is unreliable and fails to compose knowledge from sub-tasks
and solve the main compositional task."

were correct, 65% of the answers were a wrong answer sequence, and in the remaining 24%, the
model tried 10 attempts of code programs and messages in between before being killed. In 35%
of the cases, the model initially produced code which results in an infinite loop when executed on
the sample. In those cases, the model can fix this problem once (13%), three times (38%) it tries to
correct itself until shutdown, and three times (38%) it catches the problem but still outputs a wrong

RELATED WORK,0.23297491039426524,"Conclusions and future work. In this work, we analyzed the capabilities of Transformer language
models in learning compositional algorithmic tasks. To do so, we formulated a set of hypotheses
to characterize the efficiency of a model when learning compositional tasks, from efficient (H1) to
inefficient (H4) regimes. We introduced a new set of algorithmic tasks based on pointer execution
to benchmark compositional learning in large language models in a more controlled setting. On
these novel tasks, as well as other well-known benchmarks from previous works, we observe that
Transformer-based language models struggle at compositional learning on tasks demanding to learn
the composition of several discrete sub-tasks, making our hypothesis H4 most plausible (learning
the compositional task requires more samples than the sum of those required to learn the individual
sub-tasks). Further, we show (also theoretically) that learning certain (compositional) concepts with
feedforward models on gradient descent is very data inefficient, adding further support to reject
H1–H3. Finally, we empirically rule out also the possibility that these tasks can be learned in
a few-shot fashion by state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro. This evaluation of
current state-of-the-art Transformer language models may provide some directions to improvements
in compositional capabilities which would help models to be more reliable and improve on complex
algorithmic structures like reasoning or mathematics. Addressing the current limitations of this work
might also be an interesting avenue for future research."

Feedforward models on gradient descent can only learn the obvious2"
REFERENCES,0.35842293906810035,"As in our empirical results, we focus on model size and dataset size, not compute, which e.g. is
the focus of [51, 52, 50]. This has the rationale, that concepts or tasks which do not have unlimited
amounts of data and are hard to learn, can in theory still be learned while gradient descent on
feedforward models will be limited. In particular, in this part we show classes of tasks that are
learnable from a single sample each (i.e., learnable within hypothesis H1), but on which feedforward
models trained with gradient descent will learn within hypothesis H4, needing up to exponentially
many samples. See also Figure A.4 for an intuition."
REFERENCES,0.3602150537634409,"From complexity theory, we know that finding the proof of membership of a string in a language is in
general less efficient than verifying its membership given a proof. We use this structure:
Definition A.1 (K). Let L be any recursive decision problem with solution in space O(n) and being
verifiable in time O(n). Let us look at all algorithms solving L and let k(n) be a (high) lower bound
of them. We denote K to be the set of choosing one upper bound k(n) per such decision problem."
REFERENCES,0.36200716845878134,"Some examples: Assuming the exponential time hypothesis, SAT solution algorithms need exponen-
tial time (i.e. k(n) can be an arbitrarily high polynomial), and verification is in O(n). Under the
same assumption, the edit distance algorithm needs Ω(n2−ϵ) for any ϵ > 0 while being verifiable in
O(n) [53]. Usually, no lower bounds are proven for such problems, but the fact that we can not find
faster algorithms makes assumptions reasonable.
Definition A.2 (Concept, Concept Class). A concept C = (UC, fC, nC) consists of an algorithm f
defined on a set of inputs U and a natural number nC. We call nC the “difficulty"" of C. A concept
class C is an infinite set of concepts where each n ∈N occurs only finitely many times."
REFERENCES,0.36379928315412186,"The intuition: A concept class is a set of concepts that are connected by some common basis, e.g.
they all pose certain challenges (e.g. finding a formula assignment) to an overarching problem to
learn (e.g. the SAT problem). We need a class of such problems because complexity theory makes
asymptotic statements."
REFERENCES,0.3655913978494624,"Similar definitions are used by Kearns [49], here we use a slightly different definition of concepts as
functions instead of subsets of an object set to better suit today’s applications.
Definition A.3 (Application of a Concept). Given a concept C = (U, f, n), an application of C is a
pair (T, E) of nonempty sets of samples (i.e. input-output pairs) of f. We call T the training set and
E the test set or examination set."
REFERENCES,0.3673835125448029,"Here we deviate from classical learning theory in that we do not define a distribution. Instead,
we define the more general case of having a training regime and testing regime since we focus on
systematic generalization. One can additionally require E and T to be statistically dependent to
recover classical train-test distributions, as we, for example, show in Appendix A.5.
Definition A.4 (Learning Algorithm). Let S denote the set of all finite datasets (i.e., sets of input-
output pairs) and Θ the set of all input-bounded and runtime-bounded algorithms. A learning
algorithm is an algorithm L : S →Θ.

ready in such a restricted setting, learning the task from scratch is extremely inefficient, requiring a
multiplicative factor of one million samples more than the discrete optimization algorithm described
in Appendix B.2, which in this case corresponds to the optimal learner mentioned in Corollary 5.7.
This confirms the outcome that our theoretical framework would predict, i.e. LLaMA fails at learning
from few examples, although the existence of the optimal learner shows that it would be possible."
REFERENCES,0.4050179211469534,"The theory allows us to extend this result beyond the limit of the empirically verifiable. When
more primitives are available (e.g. in general-purpose datasets like The Pile [54], finding the right
functional composition of the sub-tasks quickly becomes a computationally hard combinatorial task.
With such problems, the theory says that plain gradient descent will tend to just memorize the few
samples of the compositional task, instead of (combinatorially) finding the right composition."
REFERENCES,0.4068100358422939,"Nasr et al. [55] show that one can extract more memorized data from larger models. Tirumala et al.
[56] have shown that larger language models memorize faster than smaller models. Based on this,
we can conservatively assume a constant number of steps for memorizing the fixed-size answer to a
sample. This fits definition A.6 for a learning algorithm LF learning with (growing) constant-depth
feedforward models, depending on the input size in the training data, as one gradient step has the
time complexity of a forward pass."

relationships. It has been shown, however, that learning such structural causal models is NP-hard

applying all structural causal models and generate observations for each concept. Now let us test those
functions by an exam after training (i.e. by just asking for the structural causal model). Then, for
this specific concept class, Theorem A.5 and Corollary A.7 hold for k(n) being a super-polynomial
function."

one particular event always leads to another. Such inference might be important for a few selected
cases. Again, by constructing a concept class containing functions such that the structural model is
given or inferable and the always-cause is asked or needed for predictions in the inference phase, it
follows by Theorem A.5 and Corollary A.7 that learning such concepts requires a lot of computation -
and many samples for feedforward neural networks although theoretically unnecessary."

generalization than the original Transformer. For instance, a UT-style transformer displayed good
performance on compositional tasks like SCAN Csordás et al. [61]. The model based on UT reached
a similar performance as the original LLaMA model, i.e. a behavior that could be classified in H4.
We then also experimented with a Hyper-UT-style LLaMA, based on the aforementioned Hyper-UT
work [17], in which each layer selects its weights from a common weight embedding pool to realize
a parameter-efficient model. This model consistently achieved a lower accuracy compared to LLaMA
on a large set of small algorithmic tasks. Thus, we chose not to systematically explore its performance
in a more challenging compositional algorithmic setting. The results are shown in table C.12. The
hyperparameters used to train the model are the same as the ones used for the standard models (see

Input sequences tokenization"
REFERENCES,0.7096774193548387,"Unlike open-source models, such as the LLaMa, closed-source LLMs do not allow to customize the
tokenization process. Hence, tokenization could potentially represent a major confounder for our
prompting experiments. If fact, an erroneous mapping between words and tokens would inevitably
undermine the ability of the model to correctly perform matching operations in the input sequence,
making it impossible to successfully reconstruct the correct path in pointer execution tasks. In this
Appendix section, we provide more details on a set of control experiments that were designed to
ensure that this phenomenon did not play a role in our empirical evaluation."
REFERENCES,0.7114695340501792,"As a preliminary step, we ablated in our experiments different strategies to structure our input
components. However, we found that alternative designs for the tasks structure (e.g. LL-N-LL, where
L represents a lower-case Latin letter and N a one-digit number) were always detrimental for the task
accuracy compared to the current sequence design (i.e. LLNLL). To ensure that the input sequences
of our pointer execution tasks were effectively tokenized as expected, we run some quantitative
experiments with GPT-4’s open-source tokenizer (tiktoken). Unfortunately, we could not find an
open-source tokenizer for Gemini-Pro; the available token counter only provides limited information
about the actual tokenization."
REFERENCES,0.7132616487455197,"Analyzing the GPT-4 tokenizer results, we found that the digit delimiter ensures safe splitting within
a word in 100% of the samples, i.e. LLNLL always yields [LL, N, LL]. Additionally, we observed
that 13.2% of the 2-grams were split into two different tokens (e.g., bq is tokenized to b and q),
which may affect the attention mechanism. As an additional experiment, we removed these 2-grams
from the dataset. However, removing the “splittable” 2-grams did not result in an improvement of the
performance (the accuracy decreased from 0.19 to 0.05 on PEN) when using the best-performing

natural English words. Natural-PEN inherits a similar structure of the components from the original
PEN task, WNW, where W in this case are 3-characters English words. In practice, we filtered all valid
3-gram words from Scrabble3 that were translated to a single token when using GPT-4’s tokenizer.
This gave us a set of 707 words (out of the original 1338 words). Similar to the experiment in
the previous paragraph, we find that the GPT-4’s performance using the best prompting techniques
does not improve on this in-distribution, natural English words, yielding even a lower accuracy on

""pk0tq"" matches with ""tq0bn"". The word ""pk0tq"" is 3th and ""tq0bn"" is 12th, so 1 left matches so far.
""tq0bn"" matches with ""bn0vl"". The word ""tq0bn"" is 12th and ""bn0vl"" is 10th, so 2 left matches so far.
""bn0vl"" matches with ""vl0gg"". The word ""bn0vl"" is 10th and ""vl0gg"" is 9th, so 3 left matches so far.
""vl0gg"" matches with ""gg0hy"". The word ""vl0gg"" is 9th and ""gg0hy"" is 2th, so 4 left matches so far.
""gg0hy"" matches with ""hy0jm"". The word ""gg0hy"" is 2th and ""hy0jm"" is 14th, so 4 left matches so far.
There are no further matches for ""hy0jm"", so we end the sequence here.
Finally, we calculate the number of left matches times the number of matches for each word and get:

bn0vl: 2*3=6

CLAIMS,0.8637992831541219,"Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract describes testing LLMs on compositional tasks and describes the
most important results. It also mentions theoretical contributions. By describing the key
points of the paper, the scope is reflected.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8655913978494624,"• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.8673835125448028,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer:[Yes]
Justification: The paper explicitly discusses the limitations in section 7 and tries to lay out
all information for critical reading.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8691756272401434,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8888888888888888,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results."

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text."

BROADER IMPACTS,0.9551971326164874,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards"
BROADER IMPACTS,0.956989247311828,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: We work with randomly generated synthetic textual data which does not
contain any information which would make it susceptible to misuse.
Guidelines:"
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9587813620071685,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.

not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
