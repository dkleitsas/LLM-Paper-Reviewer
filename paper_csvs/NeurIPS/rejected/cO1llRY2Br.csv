Introduction
16"
INTRODUCTION,0.0194954128440367,"Language Models (LMs) [1] are becoming imperative tools for consulting in real-world scenarios.
17"
INTRODUCTION,0.020642201834862386,"One significant reason for the prevalence of LMs is their ability to answer factoid questions. For
18"
INTRODUCTION,0.021788990825688075,"example, when we ask an LM with the question “Who is president of America ?”, it returns the
19"
INTRODUCTION,0.022935779816513763,"answer “Joe Biden”. Even though a mass amount of knowledge is stored in the LMs, we still face the
20"
INTRODUCTION,0.02408256880733945,"issue of out-of-date and missing knowledge [2, 3]. Alternatively, some knowledge may change over
21"
INTRODUCTION,0.02522935779816514,"years and some domain-specific knowledge may be absent from the LMs.
22"
INTRODUCTION,0.026376146788990827,"To bridge the gap, the task of model editing is introduced to edit the knowledge in LMs, which
23"
INTRODUCTION,0.027522935779816515,"targets at conducting change to the parameters of LMs and inject certain knowledge to them [4]. The
24"
INTRODUCTION,0.028669724770642203,"difficulty of this task lies in the manipulation to the LMs, where the knowledge is implicitly stored in
25"
INTRODUCTION,0.02981651376146789,"dense vectors. A naive solution to model editing is fine-tuning a LM with the new knowledge, whereas
26"
INTRODUCTION,0.03096330275229358,"the cost is climbing with the surging size of LMs. More recent studies propose to directly update
27"
INTRODUCTION,0.03211009174311927,"the models’ weights in mastery phase [5, 6] via either teaching a hyper-network to learn the change
28"

29"
INTRODUCTION,0.034403669724770644,"above are efficient in updating knowledge in LMs, they encounter the difficulties of differentiating the
30"
