ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.003076923076923077,"Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is the predominant algorithm for train-
ing text generation models. This paradigm relies on direct supervision examples,
which is not applicable to many emerging applications, such as generating ad-
versarial attacks or generating prompts to control language models. Reinforce-
ment learning (RL) on the other hand offers a more ﬂexible solution by allowing
users to plug in arbitrary task metrics as reward. Yet previous RL algorithms for
text generation, such as policy gradient (on-policy RL) and Q-learning (off-policy
RL), are often notoriously inefﬁcient or unstable to train due to the large sequence
space and the sparse reward received only at the end of sequences. In this paper,
we introduce a new RL formulation for text generation from the soft Q-learning
(SQL) perspective. It enables us to draw from the latest RL advances, such as path
consistency learning, to combine the best of on-/off-policy updates, and learn ef-
fectively from sparse reward. We apply the approach to a wide range of text gener-
ation tasks, including learning from noisy/negative examples, adversarial attacks,
and prompt generation. Experiments show our approach consistently outperforms
both task-specialized algorithms and the previous RL methods."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.009230769230769232,"Recent natural language generation systems have made remarkable progress in producing well-
formed coherent text, especially with the massive pretrained language models (LMs) (Radford et al.,
2019; Brown et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2019). Those models are typically trained
using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with a large amount of data supervisions. Despite
its successful outcomes, the standard training method suffers from limited applicability to many
emerging text generation problems, where little or no supervised data is available. Prominent exam-
ples of such low-data problems include generating prompts to control the massive LMs (Yin et al.,
2019; Shin et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2021), learning text generation from noisy or even negative
data, generating adversarial text attacks for robustness study (Wallace et al., 2019; Atanasova et al.,
2020), and others (Figure 1, right). Due to the failure of standard MLE, people have had to devise
specialized algorithms for those problems respectively."
INTRODUCTION,0.012307692307692308,"On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) offers an alternative prin-
cipled framework for learning from arbitrary reward functions, and has achieved great advances in
robotic and game control. However, RL by far has made limited success for training text generation,
primarily due to the key challenges of sparse reward (i.e., a single reward signal is received only
after the whole text sequence is generated) and large action space (i.e., a vocabulary of millions of
words). For instance, a popular family of RL algorithms studied extensively for text generation is the
policy-based (Williams, 1992) or actor-critic based (Bahdanau et al., 2016; Rennie et al., 2017) al-
gorithms, with policy gradient (PG) being the most prevalent example (Ranzato et al., 2016; Li et al.,
2016; Rennie et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2018; Pasunuru & Bansal, 2018; Paulus et al., 2018). Those
algorithms train the model with on-policy updates, i.e., the text samples used for estimating policy
gradients are from the target model itself. Due to the exponentially large space of sequences, on-
policy updates often suffer from extremely high variance and low data efﬁciency (e.g., most model
samples are not useful for learning). Thus directly training with PG from scratch is usually impos-
sible. In practice, the model has to be initialized by MLE training, followed by PG as ﬁnetuning,
which often leads to limited improvement (Choshen et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2018)."

INTRODUCTION,0.08923076923076922,"Figure 1: Left: An overview of the proposed SQL algorithm for text generation. Text generation
is challenging due to sparse reward (i.e., the rewards of all intermediate steps are 0) and large ac-
tion space (i.e., large vocabulary). Our SQL formulation enables several key algorithmic features
as highlighted with yellow color, including (1) the combined on- and off-policy updates for the best
of both, (2) bridging the ﬁnal non-zero reward to directly supervise the Q-value estimation at inter-
mediate steps for learning stability, and (3) simultaneously updating the Q-values of all candidate
actions for efﬁciency. Right: We explore diverse applications of the text-generation RL algorithm."
INTRODUCTION,0.09230769230769231,"Another set of work has resorted to off-policy RL. The key advantage is that samples from other
sources, e.g., human-written text, can be used, making them more data efﬁcient than on-policy
methods. Previous work has used either importance weighted PG (Pang & He, 2021; Zhou et al.,
2017; Kandasamy et al., 2017) or Q-learning based algorithms (Guo, 2015; Jaques et al., 2020;
Narasimhan et al., 2015). However, off-policy methods have been considered to be less stable. For
example, the Q-learning performance relies heavily on how accurate the learned Q-function assesses
the quality of intermediate subsequences – a challenging task due to the sparse reward signals."
INTRODUCTION,0.09538461538461539,"In this paper, we develop a new RL formulation for text generation that tackles the above issues
(Figure 1, left). We reframe the text generation problem from the soft Q-learning perspective origi-
nally developed in robotics (Haarnoja et al., 2017; Schulman et al., 2017). The resulting connection
allows us to seamlessly take advantage of the latest successful techniques from the RL literature. In
particular, we introduce and adapt the principled path consistency learning (Nachum et al., 2017) to
text generation, that (1) offers a natural way to train the model with both on- and off-policy updates,
hence combining the best of the two strategies, (2) bridges the sparse reward signal to directly su-
pervise the Q function learning, leading to more accurate Q estimation and credit assignment, and
(3) makes efﬁcient updates to Q-values by considering all candidate actions together."
INTRODUCTION,0.09846153846153846,"The generality and efﬁciency of the proposed method allows us to train text generation in a wide
range of applications: (1) With noisy and negative training examples, our approach learns to gener-
ate accurate entailment text that greatly improves upon the data itself as well as other various training
methods; (2) Our approach also manages to train an effective adversarial text generator for robust-
ness test for classiﬁers; (3) We train a prompt generator with our algorithm to achieve controllable
generation of pretrained LMs in terms of topics. On all the three tasks, our approach consistently
improves over not only previous RL algorithms for text generation, but also diverse task-specialized
methods designed speciﬁcally for each of the problems, respectively. In the appendix (§A.1.4), we
also show that on standard supervised tasks where MLE prevails, our approach is competitive to train
text generation models from scratch, which was usually impossible for previous RL algorithms."

REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (RL) FORMULATIONS FOR TEXT GENERATION"
BACKGROUND AND CHALLENGES,0.12923076923076923,"Notations.
Previous research has formulated text generation as an RL problem by considering
the following ﬁnite-time Markov Decision Process (MDP). At each time step t, let the “state” be
st = y<t, namely the partial sequence generated so far. The model, also known as the “agent”,
takes as input the current state st and outputs a token, also called “action”, at ∈V according to a
policy π(at | st). The agent then receives a reward rt = r(st, at) and deterministically transitions
to next state st+1 (i.e., the concatenation of the tokens in st and the new token at)."

it generates the full sequence, (2) the action space (i.e., the vocabulary V) is extremely large, often
containing millions of words. The challenges have led to difﬁculties of the two major families of
RL approaches applied to text generation problems, as detailed below."
BACKGROUND AND CHALLENGES,0.14461538461538462,"Policy-based RL techniques directly parameterize the policy πθ with parameters θ. Thus the policy
πθ(at | st) exactly corresponds to the above generation model pθ(yt | y<t). Policy gradient (PG)

from the the current policy πθ itself. In practice, however, optimizing this objective alone from
scratch is unlikely going to work because most samples τ ∼πθ are just gibberish with zero reward,
failing to provide meaningful training signals for updating the policy. Previous literature either
initializes the policy πθ with MLE training, and/or use a combination of MLE and PG updates,

Q-learning an off-policy algorithm because of its ability to use samples coming from other policies.

BACKGROUND AND CHALLENGES,0.18769230769230769,"However, the training can be unstable and inefﬁcient due to several challenges: (1) The bootstrap-
ping nature of the above regression problem can make the training unstable. That is, the regression
target rt + γ maxat+1 Q¯θ(st+1, at+1) itself is derived from the Q-function to be learned (Kumar
et al., 2019). The problem is exacerbated in the presence of sparse reward in text generation, where
the real observed signal rt is zero for all intermediate t < T; (2) The large action space (e.g., 104) in
text generation results in slow updates. In particular, notice that Eq.(4) applies the gradient update to
the Qθ-value of the only one particular token at (out of the 104 candidate tokens in the vocabulary),
making the training inefﬁcient; (3) Besides, pure off-policy updates could be highly sensitive to the
quality of training data, and miss the opportunity of on-policy exploration that maximizes the reward
of interest in a more direct way."

LEARNING FROM NOISY (NEGATIVE) TEXT"
APPLICATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS,0.31384615384615383,"The popular MLE algorithm learns by (blindly) imitating training data. However, it is often ex-
pensive to curate clean quality data. It is thus highly desirable to be able to learn from data with
noises, or even negative examples. With the guidance of task metrics (rewards), the model can even
learn to “outperform” the training data and achieve desired generation behaviors. To this end, we
consider the task of entailment generation (Pasunuru & Bansal, 2017). Given a sentence (premise),
the goal is to generate a new sentence (hypothesis) that logically follows the premise. For example,
given source sentence “Sophie is walking a dog outside her house”, the hypothe-
ses “Sophie is outdoor” is considered entailed, but “Sophie is inside her house”
is not and even is a negative (contradictive) sentence."
APPLICATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS,0.3169230769230769,"Setup (more in the appendix §A.2.1).
We sub-sampled 50k training examples from the SNLI
dataset (Bowman et al., 2015), a commonly used entailment classiﬁcation dataset. The hypotheses
have an average entailment probability of only 50%, and over 2/5 of them less than 20% (nega-
tive/contradictive examples). This poses a signiﬁcant challenge for the models to learn from the
noises. The rewards used in RL algorithms include (1) the entailment score of the generation mea-
sured by a robust entailment classiﬁer (Nie et al., 2020), (2) the log-likelihood of the generation
as an indicator of language quality measured by a GPT-2 language model (Radford et al., 2019),
and (3) BLEU score w.r.t the input premises as another language quality reward that avoids trivial
outputs. We sum together all rewards with weights 1.0."

et al., 2021). Since text generation models intrinsically trade off diversity and quality (Caccia et al.,
2019; Hashimoto et al., 2019), we vary the generation diversity by generating samples via top-p
sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019) with different p values, and plot the entailment rate and perplexity
against diversity, resp. We also evaluate the samples produced by beam-search decoding."

Figure 3 (left) shows the results.
First, notice that MLE performs poorly, while
MLE+reward improves upon it. This is not surprising as the training data contain noisy/negative
examples. Similarly, since the pure off-policy algorithm GOLD-s relies heavily on the data distri-
bution, we observed that it achieves sub-optimal performance. The on-policy MLE+PG with MLE
initialization gives better entailment rate. In comparison, our full SQL framework achieves the best
entailment-diversity trade-off. The comparison between SQL and SQL(single) highlights the
importance of having the multi-step objective which directly uses the end reward rather than boot-
strapping intermediate Q-values for supervision."

Adversarial attacks is an increasingly important research topic as they reveal models’ vulnerabili-

2020), where we want to generate universal examples that trick the model on all possible inputs.
For instance, consider the context of entailment classiﬁcation. Our goal is to ﬁnd universal human-
readable hypotheses that are going to be classiﬁed as “entailment” with as high probability as pos-
sible, regardless of the input premises. This is a more challenging setting compared to previous

pipeline that eventually returns a score. To demonstrate this, we consider the emerging task of
prompting a large pretrained LM for controllable generation (Hu et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2019;
Brown et al., 2020). The goal is to learn to generate text prompts that steer the LM to generate
sentences of certain desired attributes (e.g., topics). The problem of controlling the generation of
pretrained LMs was previously approached through specialized algorithms such as modifying the
LM hidden states during decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Krause et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020). Here
we show that prompts offer an easier, faster, more effective way for controlled generation."

lable generation techniques based on pretrained LMs, namely PPLM (Dathathri et al., 2019) and
GeDi (Krause et al., 2020), following similar procedures using their open-sourced code. We use a
distilled GPT-2 model3 as the pretrained LM to be controlled. For rewards, we use the topic accu-
racy of the continuation sentences measured by a zero-shot classiﬁer, plus the the log-likelihood of
continuation sentences as the language quality reward measured by a distilled GPT-2."

Figure 5 shows the topic accuracy of the controlled LM outputs averaged across the 7
topics, and Table 1 shows the respective language quality results. More detailed topic accuracy
results and samples are provided in the appendix (§A.1.3) (where GeDi obtained low accuracy on
2 of the 7 topics, possibly because the topic tokens are tokenized into two subwords for which the
model released by the authors was not speciﬁcally trained). We can see that the prompts generated
by our SQL cause the LM to generate sentences with high topic accuracy while maintaining low
perplexity in most settings. Increasing the prompt length positively impacts the topic accuracy,
which makes sense because longer prompts give more ﬂexible for steering the LM. The comparison
between MLE and SQL(off) shows that the off-policy component of SQL is better than standard
MLE training, as it incorporates reward signals instead of just blindly following the (noisy) data."
PROMPT GENERATION FOR CONTROLLING PRETRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS,0.4369230769230769,"Next, comparing with the previous steered decoding such as PPLM and GeDi, we can see the
prompt-based control trained with RL achieves better trade-off between topic accuracy and language
quality. Moreover, once a prompt is produced, we can use the pretrained LM to generate text of de-
sired topics efﬁciently, with the same time cost as standard non-controlled decoding. In comparison,
the dedicated steered decoding is often orders-of-magnitude slower, as shown in Table 2."

RELATED WORK,0.4430769230769231,"Standard RL algorithms maximizing the external rewards can sometimes be over-sensitive to the
randomness in the environment. Recent works have considered maximum-entropy RL (MaxEnt
RL) extensions, such as the soft Q-learning (SQL) (Haarnoja et al., 2017; Nachum et al., 2017;
Schulman et al., 2017), that maximize the entropy of policy besides the rewards, and have demon-
strated substantial improvement in robotic and game control (Ziebart et al., 2008; O’Donoghue et al.,
2017; Nachum et al., 2018; Eysenbach & Levine, 2021). Our work is the ﬁrst to adapt SQL and its
advanced variants (in particular the path consistency learning (Nachum et al., 2017)) to the chal-
lenging text generation problem and show signiﬁcant results on diverse applications. Applying RL
for text generation has been discussed in alleviating the exposure bias problem and optimizing task
metrics (Li et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Rennie et al., 2017; Paulus et al., 2018; Chen & Bansal,
2018). For example, Ranzato et al. (2016) used the REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992), and
Bahdanau et al. (2016) used the actor-critic algorithm; Guo et al. (2018) and Shi et al. (2018) tried
to relieve the sparsity problem via hierarchical and inverse RL methods, resp. They are all on-policy
RL algorithms with the need of pretraining their models using MLE. Another line of work focused
mostly on using only off-policy data, often for ofﬂine training of chatbots (Jaques et al., 2020; Kan-
dasamy et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017; Pang & He, 2021). As a result, the opportunity of directly
improving the reward (as in on-policy updates) for other rich tasks is missed. Our proposed frame-
work combines on- and off-policy training, and further offers solutions for efﬁcient training from
scratch in the presence of large action space and sparse sequence-level reward in text generation."

in four applications, it could be adapted to other (emerging) applications. One major component in
these applications is the design of the reward function, which inﬂuences the behavior of the trained
agent. While we believe the MaxEnt RL framework is more robust against reward misspeciﬁca-
tion (Eysenbach & Levine, 2021), the potential failures of sub-optimal reward functions are widely
known and discussed.4 To this end, deploying this model to the wild requires careful and extensive
examination, using tools such as Ribeiro et al. (2020). Further, we highlight the application for
(black-box) adversarial attacks in the paper, with the intention of using adversarial attacks to un-
derstand the model’s inner workings. That being said, this could potentially be misused to conduct
malicious attacks against systems. Hence, users of this framework might want to conduct adversarial
attacks against their own models to avoid being attacked by other people with bad intentions."

We study on two tasks, E2E (Novikova
et al., 2017) and CommonGEN (Lin et al., 2020),
and use the respective datasets pre-processed by
(Gehrmann et al., 2021) which allow sequence-
to-sequence modeling with standard transform-
ers. We run four sets of methods: the standard
MLE training (MLE); PG training from scratch
(PG); joint MLE and PG training, with MLE ini-
tialization (MLE+PG); and our SQL training from scratch with both off-policy and on-policy updates
(SQL). We use the standard BLEU as reward. We additionally investigate the training stability and
sensitivity w.r.t hyperparameters, in particular the scale of reward. To this end, for MLE+PG and
SQL, we vary the reward scale in {1, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000} and evaluate the respective perfor-
mance under different scales."
REFERENCES,0.76,"Results.
Table 3 shows the performance on E2E of different models whose hyperparameters are
picked using the validation set. We can see the proposed SQL that trains models from scratch
achieves competitive results with the common MLE and MLE+PG. In contrast, the PG algorithm
alone without MLE fails the training. Figure 7 (left) shows the respective training curves (on the
validation set), demonstrating that SQL converges in an efﬁcient and stable way as MLE."

reward scales. We can see SQL is signiﬁcantly more robust as reward scale changes, while MLE+PG
tends to collapse with improper reward scale conﬁgurations."

§4.3, in which we ﬁnd it beneﬁcial to warm-up the model with just off-policy training. We apply

entailment score of a generation in terms of the input premise, (2) a GPT-2 language model (Radford

data for the MLE training in MLE+PG and the off-policy updates for our SQL. We do not compare
with previous specialized adversarial text attack methods, because they either are not applicable to
the universal attack setting (Morris et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Ebrahimi et al., 2017), or were not
designed to generate human-readable sentences (Wallace et al., 2019). Besides, it is worth noting
that the general RL algorithms have an additional advantage of doing black-box attacks. That is,
the algorithms only require the ability to query the entailment classiﬁer for entailment probability,
without need of knowing the internal structure of the classiﬁer (e.g., for computing gradients) as in
previous attack algorithms (Ebrahimi et al., 2017; Wallace et al., 2019)."

SETUP DETAILS: §4.3"
REFERENCES,0.8246153846153846,"Following (Dathathri et al., 2019), we aim to control the generation to have one of 7 topics (e.g.,
“science”); the generated prompt is prepended to one of 20 input sentences (Figure 4) for the pre-
trained LM to generate continuation sentences. There is no direct supervision data available for
training the prompt generator. We randomly create some noisy text as the training data for MLE
baselines below and for off-policy updates for our algorithm. Speciﬁcally, the noisy text is created
by sampling keywords and topics from the list used in (Dathathri et al., 2020) and a paraphrase
generation model."
REFERENCES,0.8276923076923077,"Figure 4 shows the architecture of prompt-based controllable generation. We compare our SQL
method with MLE+PG as before. At training time, for each generated prompt sample, the pretrained
LM generates 2 continuation sentences for evaluating average reward. We use a zero-shot classiﬁer
to evaluate the topic accuracy of the continuation sentences. That is, we do not assume access to
classiﬁers pretrained on topic-speciﬁc sentences, because generating such topic-speciﬁc sentences
is the goal of the task in the ﬁrst place. We additionally use an LM to evaluate the log-likelihood
of continuation sentences for measuring language quality. Since the prompt length could impact the
generated sentences, we conducted experiments with maximum prompt length 5, 10, and 15. As
ablation study, we also evaluate the SQL algorithm with only off-policy updates (i.e., without on-
policy exploration), denoted as SQL(off), and compare it with vanilla MLE training. At test time,
given a topic, the trained prompt generator produces one prompt using beam search decoding. For
each generated prompt, the pretrained LM generates 100 sentences using top-k decoding (with k =
50) for evaluation. Finally, we also compare with two specialized controllable generation techniques
based on pretrained LMs, namely PPLM (Dathathri et al., 2019) and GeDi (Krause et al., 2020),
following similar procedures using their open-sourced code. We use a distilled GPT-2 model11 as
the pretrained LM to be controlled.
We use the paraphrase generation model based on Zhang
et al. (2019).12
During decoding, we include no repeat ngram size= 2, which improves
readability.13"
