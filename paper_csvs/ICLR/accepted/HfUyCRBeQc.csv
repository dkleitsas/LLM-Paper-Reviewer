ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0022522522522522522,"Recent work has shown that models trained to the same objective, and which achieve
similar measures of accuracy on consistent test data, may nonetheless behave very
differently on individual predictions. This inconsistency is undesirable in high-stakes
contexts, such as medical diagnosis and finance. We show that this inconsistent behavior
extends beyond predictions to feature attributions, which may likewise have negative im-
plications for the intelligibility of a model, and one’s ability to find recourse for subjects.
We then introduce selective ensembles to mitigate such inconsistencies by applying
hypothesis testing to the predictions of a set of models trained using randomly-selected
starting conditions; importantly, selective ensembles can abstain in cases where a con-
sistent outcome cannot be achieved up to a specified confidence level. We prove that
that prediction disagreement between selective ensembles is bounded, and empirically
demonstrate that selective ensembles achieve consistent predictions and feature attribu-
tions while maintaining low abstention rates. On several benchmark datasets, selective
ensembles reach zero inconsistently predicted points, with abstention rates as low 1.5%."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.006756756756756757,"Recent work has drawn attention to the fact that models that appear similar from aggregate quality measures,
such as accuracy, often have markedly different behavior at the level of individual predictions (Black and
Fredrikson, 2021; Marx et al., 2019). Further, in deep models, this inconsistency can arise even between
closely-related models, such as those arising from different initializations, or from leave-one-out differences
in the training data (Black and Fredrikson, 2021; D’Amour et al., 2020). This behavior is undesirable
in many high-stakes contexts, such as medical applications and credit-approving scenarios, as it may cast
doubt on the justifiability of the model’s outcome and pose difficulties for reproducibility and comparison."
INTRODUCTION,0.009009009009009009,"We begin by demonstrating that not only are the predictions of related deep models often dissimilar, but their
feature attributions (Simonyan et al., 2014; Sundararajan et al., 2017; Leino et al., 2018) are as well (Sec-
tion 3). In particular, we show that there is little connection between a model’s gradients, which are the basis
for many deep attribution methods, and the labels that it predicts—models with identical predictions can
have arbitrarily different gradients almost everywhere (Theorem 3.1). In practice, we show that this result oc-
curs often on common datasets across closely-related models, leading to significant variation in attributions.
This may be undesirable, as feature attributions are commonly used to provide explanations (Simonyan
et al., 2014; Sundararajan et al., 2017; Leino et al., 2018), debug model behavior (Adebayo et al., 2020),
and diagnose problems related to privacy and fairness (Leino and Fredrikson, 2020; Datta et al., 2016).
Beyond these pragmatic concerns, this suggests that the salient factors behind these models’ predictions
on many points may have little in common, even when models appear to do comparably well on test data."
INTRODUCTION,0.01126126126126126,"To address inconsistency in both prediction and attribution, we then turn to ensembling, a well-known
approach for reducing predictive variance (Meir et al., 1995; Naftaly et al., 1997; Lincoln and Skrzypek,
1990; Fumera et al., 2005; Hansen and Salamon, 1990; Krogh and Vedelsby, 1995). We introduce selective
ensembles, which leverage a recent result on multinomial rank verification (Hung et al., 2019)—which has
also been used recently for making certifiably-robust predictions (Cohen et al., 2019)—to efficiently mitigate
the problem of inconsistency with a probabilistic guarantee. Given a point to classify, a selective ensemble
returns the mode of the class labels predicted on that point, where the mode is sampled over models that
vary according to a specified source of randomness in the training process. Importantly, if the mode cannot
be inferred with sufficient confidence, then the selective ensemble abstains from prediction. This allows us
to bound the probability that these ensembles do not return the true mode prediction (Theorem 4.1), and by
extension, the rate of disagreement between selective ensembles (Corollary 4.3). In addition, we show that"

2000) (Corollary 4.2), providing guidance on how to effectively use of them in practice."
INTRODUCTION,0.018018018018018018,"Our experiments show that on seven benchmark datasets, selective ensembles of just ten models either
agree on the entire test data across random differences in how their constituent models are trained, or
abstain at reasonably low rates (1-5% in most cases; Section 5.1). Additionally, we show that simple
ensembling doubles the agreement of attributions on key metrics on average, and when the variance of
the constituent models is high that selective ensembling further enhances this effect (Section 5.2)."
INTRODUCTION,0.02027027027027027,"In summary, our contributions are: (1) we show that beyond predictions, feature attributions are not consis-
tent across seemingly inconsequential random choices during learning (Section 3); (2) we introduce selec-
tive ensembling, a learning method that guarantees bounded inconsistency in predictions, (Section 4); and
(3) we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on seven datasets, showing that selective ensembles
consistently predict all points across models trained with different random seeds or leave-one-out differences
in their training data, while also achieving low abstention rates and higher feature attribution consistency."

NOTATION AND PRELIMINARIES"
NOTATION AND PRELIMINARIES,0.024774774774774775,"We assume a supervised classification setting, with data points (x,y)∈X×Y, drawn from data distribution,
D, where x represents a vector of features and y a response. In order to capture the effects of arbitrary
random events on a learned model—ranging from randomness during training to randomness in the data
selection process—we generalize the standard concept of a learning rule to that of a learning pipeline.
Specifically, a learning pipeline, P, is a procedure that outputs a model, h : X →Y, taking as input a
random state, S ∼S, containing all the information necessary for P to produce a model (including the
architecture, training set, random coin flips used by the learning rule, etc.). Intuitively, S represents a
distribution over random events that might impact the learned model. For example, S might capture
randomness in sampling of the training set, or nondeterminism in the optimization process, e.g., the
initialization of parameters, the order in which batches are processed, or the effects of dropout."
NOTATION AND PRELIMINARIES,0.02702702702702703,"In our experiments, we model S to capture two specific types of random choices, namely (1) the initial
parameters of the model, and (2) leave-one-out changes to the training data. As the initial parameters of
the model tend to be determined by a random seed, we will interchangeably refer to this as the selection of
random seed. More generally, both of these types of choices instantiate a broader class of choices that could
be considered arbitrary, despite the fact that they may impact the predictions (Black and Fredrikson, 2021;
Marx et al., 2019; Mehrer et al., 2020) (Section 5.1) and explanations (Section 5.2) of the resulting model."

INSTABILITY OF FEATURE ATTRIBUTIONS IN DEEP MODELS,0.03153153153153153,"Before we consider mitigating predictive inconsistency with ensembling, we first demonstrate that models’
inconsistency across random choices in training is exhibited not only through its predictions, but through
its feature attributions as well. Feature attributions refer to numeric scores generated for some set of a
model’s features—most commonly the model’s input features—which are meant to connote how important
each feature is in generating the model’s prediction. Feature attributions are commonly used as a tool for
explaining model behavior (Simonyan et al., 2014; Leino et al., 2018; Sundararajan et al., 2017; Adebayo
et al., 2020) localized to given set of inputs. Thus, inconsistent feature attributions between models suggest
the models differ in the process by which they arrive at their predictions, even if the predictions are the same."
INSTABILITY OF FEATURE ATTRIBUTIONS IN DEEP MODELS,0.033783783783783786,"In deep models, many of the most popular attribution methods are based on the model’s gradients at or
around a given point (Simonyan et al., 2014; Sundararajan et al., 2017). Accordingly, we will focus on
the stability of gradients, and show via analysis and experiment that they are not stable in conventional
deep models. First, we motivate our results by showing that even two deep models that predict the same
labels on all points may have arbitrarily different gradients almost everywhere. Later, in our empirical
evaluation (Section 5.2), we demonstrate the extent of the differences between Saliency Maps (Simonyan
et al., 2014) (i.e., input gradients) of deep networks even when the randomness of the learning pipeline
is controlled to allow only one-point differences in the training set or differences in the random seed."

construction of ˆh; a sketch giving the intuition behind the construction is provided in Figure 1. In short,
we first partition the domain into contiguous regions that are given the same label by H. We then construct
ˆh from g by adjusting g to lie above or below the origin to match the prediction behavior of h in each
region. As these transformations merely shift g by a constant in each region, they do not change ∇g except
near decision boundaries, where it is necessary to move across the origin."
INSTABILITY OF FEATURE ATTRIBUTIONS IN DEEP MODELS,0.08558558558558559,"Observations.
The intuition stemming from Theorem 3.1 is that a model’s gradients at each point are
largely disconnected from the labels it predicts on a distribution. As models that make identical predictions
are likely to have similar loss on a given dataset, this theorem points to the possibility that models of
similar objective quality may still have arbitrarily different gradients. In Section 5.2, we demonstrate
that this outcome is not only possible, but that it occurs in real models—for example, on the German Credit
dataset predicting credit risk, on average, individual models with similar accuracy agree on less than two
out of the five most important features influencing their decision."

different behavior from their previous iterations. We build on the approach of ensembling for variance
reduction by showing how these differences in behavior can be bounded via selective ensembling. However,
whereas prior work which finds that more diversity among the constituent networks is beneficial for reducing
overall error (Krogh and Vedelsby, 1995; Hansen and Salamon, 1990; Maclin et al., 1995; Opitz and Shavlik,
1996), our goal is to minimize, or at least place strict bounds on, the variance component. We show that ideas

An explicit representation of the true mode predictor is, of course,
unattainable—the non-convex loss surface of deep models and the complex interactions between the
learning pipeline and the distribution of random states makes the expectation in Equation 1 infeasible to
compute analytically. However, we can approximate gP,S(x) by computing the empirical mode prediction
on x over a random sample of models produced by i.i.d. draws from P(S). But although ensembles with
sufficiently many constituent models will more reliably output the mode prediction, for any fixed-size
ensemble there will remain points on which the margin of the plurality vote is small enough to “flip” to
runner-up in some set of nearby ensembles that differ on a subset of their constituents; in other words,
these ensembles will not predict the mode prediction."

flagging unstable points on which the selective ensemble cannot accurately determine the mode prediction;

samples of P(S) from S, as described in Algorithm 1. From these predictions, we perform a two-sided
statistical test to determine if the mode prediction was selected by a statistically significant majority of
the constituent models. If the statistical test succeeds, we return the empirical mode prediction; otherwise
we abstain from predicting. Pseudocode for this prediction procedure is given in Algorithm 2. We will

SELECTIVE ENSEMBLES: PREDICTION STABILITY AND ACCURACY"
FMNIST,0.27927927927927926,"To measure prediction instability over either selective ensembles or singleton models, we compare the
predictions of each pair of models on each point in the test set, amounting to 276 comparisons for tabular

pflip, across these comparisons. We report mean and variance of this disagreement over 10 random

FMNIST,0.28153153153153154,"The results in Table 2 and Figure 3a show the percentage of points with disagreement rate greater than zero.
We see that for singleton models, as many as 57% of test points have pflip>0, indicating that disagreement
in prediction is in some cases the norm rather than the exception, although more commonly this occurs
on 5-10% of the data. Notably, selective ensembles completely mitigate this effect: even when as few as
ten models are included in the ensemble, no points experienced pflip > 0. Combined with the fact that
abstention rates remain low (1-5%) in all cases except where pflip was originally very high (e.g., German
Credit), this shows that selective ensembling can be a practical method for mitigating prediction instability."
FMNIST,0.28378378378378377,"Table 3 shows the accuracy of selective ensembles, with abstention counted towards error, as well as
accuracy of non-selective ensembles for comparison. Notably, in all six models, with the exception of
German Credit, the abstention rate drops to below 4% with 20 models in the ensemble. Accordingly, the
accuracy of the selective ensembles in these cases is comparable—typically within a few points—to that
of the traditional ensemble. However, with just five models in the ensemble, the abstention rate is 100%;
to achieve reasonable predictions with very few models, the threshold α needs to be increased accordingly.
Disagreement of non-selective ensembles are pictured in Figure 3a (with exact numbers in Appendix F):
while they do lower prediction inconsistency, they are unable to eliminate it as selective ensembles do."

features. We note that the top-k intersection is especially interesting in tabular datasets, as often only the most
important features are of explanatory interest. To stay consistent with prior work, we also include Pearson’s
Correlation Coefficient (r). Note that r and ρ vary from -1 to 1, denoting negative, zero, and positive correla-

We also present a visual comparison of model attributions, for which we simply plot the attribution for
the predicted class for a given point from nine randomly selected models out of the 24, and present the
feature attributions in order of their magnitude according to another randomly selected model (Figure 4)."

The left image in Figure 4 demonstrates the inconsistency of model attributions of
individual German Credit models on a random point in the test set. Each bar on the x-axis represents the at-
tributions for a feature, and each different-colored bar represents a different randomly selected model. Thus,
the disagreement between the sizes of the bars of different colors shows the disagreement between models
on which features should be deemed important. Notably, some of the bars on the graph depicting individual
models even have different signs, which means that models disagree on whether that feature counts towards
or against the same prediction. Similar graphs for all other datasets are included in Appendix H.1."
ATTRIBUTION STABILITY,0.3063063063063063,"We demonstrate this inconsistency further in Table 4. We see that German Credit and Seizure models
have particularly unstable attributions, as the top-k (and to a lesser extent, ρ and r) scores of attributions
of varying points in both the same model, and varying models on the same point, are quite similar. Feature
attributions of individual models are inconsistent even on highly weighted features: e.g., German Credit
dataset has a top-k intersection of just over one attribute on average—suggesting that attributions generated
through saliency maps on these sets of models may vary substantially over benign retrainings. Even on
models where the metrics are higher, e.g. Taiwanese Credit, the baseline similarity between attributions
is higher as well—thus, we see that attributions between models of the same point are usually only 2-3×
more related than those of random points within the same model."
ATTRIBUTION STABILITY,0.30855855855855857,"This instability suggests that salient variables used to inform predictions across models are sensitive to ran-

of explanations by abstaining from unstable points, and this has a marked effect when the abstention rate

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.32207207207207206,"Prior work has shown that deep models are inconsistent in their predictions across arbitrary random
changes in their training pipeline, such as initialization parameters and makeup of the training set (Black
and Fredrikson, 2021; Mehrer et al., 2020; D’Amour et al., 2020; Kolen and Pollack, 1991; Feldman, 2019).
The problem of model sensitivity, particularly to variability in the training set, can lead to an increase
generalization error (Elisseeff et al., 2003) as well as to leaking training set information (Dwork, 2006;
Yeom et al., 2018). Thus, stability-enhancing learning rules have received significant attention in order
to bolster desirable properties, such as privacy (Liu et al., 2020; Papernot et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016)."
RELATED WORK,0.32432432432432434,"One such approach is model ensembling, which has been used as a variance reduction method since the
advent of statistical learning (Zhou et al., 2002; Valentini et al., 2004; Opitz and Maclin, 1999; Tumer and
Ghosh, 1996; Dvornik et al., 2019; Hasan et al., 2020; Freund and Schapire, 1997; Sagi and Rokach, 2018;
Polikar, 2012; Che et al., 2011; Perrone and Cooper, 1992; Hansen and Salamon, 1990). However, to our
knowledge, there is little work on providing guarantees about model disagreement using ensemble models
that may abstain from prediction. We relate our approach to the classic bias-variance decomposition of
error (Domingos, 2000), showing that it certifiably bounds the variance component."
RELATED WORK,0.32657657657657657,"Selective ensembles can be seen as a way to flag points that prone to inconsistency. Under this view,
calibration and uncertainty estimation of deep model predictions (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2016; Ovadia
et al., 2019) is a related stream of work, and one could potentially use these techniques to determine when
to abstain from prediction. However, preventing inconsistent predictions and abstaining from uncertain
predictions are different goals: in our setting, the aim is to predict the mode across models drawn from a
certain distribution, whereas calibration is measured against predicting the true label. Moreover, prior work
has shown that confidence scores may not be correlated with prediction consistency across models with
different random initializations (Black and Fredrikson, 2021). Finally, while abstaining on points with low
confidence scores may lead to greater consistency, it may not yield a guarantee, which this work provides."
RELATED WORK,0.32882882882882886,"Conformal inference (Linusson et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2019; Löfström et al., 2013), which rigorously as-
signs confidence to predictions in settings where the data may differ from training, is similarly related in that
such a measure could be useful in identifying inconsistently predicted points. However, in this work, we aim
to achieve consistent predictions across a known distribution of models, as prior work, as well as our results,
suggest, even points conforming to past observations may still be predicted differently by different models."
RELATED WORK,0.3310810810810811,"In addition to inconsistent predictions, this work demonstrates how feature attributions can differ
substantially between individual deep models with inconsequential differences. Prior works investigating
instability of gradient-based explanation techniques focus on an adversarial context (Dombrowski et al.,
2019; Ghorbani et al., 2019; Heo et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). For example, Anders et al. (2020) develop
attacks to create similar models that have differing gradient-based explanations. Contrastingly, this work
focuses on the instability of counterfactual explanations between similar models that may occur naturally.
As we demonstrate in Section 5.2, model gradients can be quite dissimilar without any adversary."

gradients as well. We introduce selective ensembles to mitigate this problem by bounding a model’s

predict all points consistently over all datasets we studied. Selective ensembling may present a more
reliable way of using deep models in settings where high model complexity and stability are required."

particularly settings impacting individuals’ lives, where inconsistency may lead to confusion or even harm
to users. The aim of this paper is to prevent harm to those impacted my model decisions occurring from
inconsistent model outcomes. We note that in some high-stakes contexts, it is possible that not supplying
any outcome (i.e. abstaining) may be worse for an individual than an inconsistent outcome, and so we
expect that selective ensembles will be used with a human-in-the-loop or other decision-making framework
to adjudicate over abstained-upon points during deployment."

between demographic groups (Jones et al., 2020). We investigate the extent of this behavior in selective
ensembles and found that by and large, using selective ensembles does not exacerbate accuracy disparity by
very much (within 1% of the original disparity), although they did not ameliorate disparities in accuracy that
already existed within the performance of the algorithm. The results of these experiments are in Appendix G."

very much (within 1% of the original disparity), although they did not ameliorate disparities in accuracy
that already existed within the performance of the algorithm. The only exception to this was German
Credit, where we note, as in the remainder of our results, that the entire dataset is only 1000 points, so

feature with the largest positive gradient). Assuming the expected gradient is not degenerate (in our case
this means there is a unique top-ranked feature), we can consider the gap between the average gradient

REFERENCES,0.9932432432432432,"Figure 10: We plot the average similarity across feature attributions for an individual point, averaged
over 276 comparisons of feature attributions from two different models. This is aggregated across the
entire validation split. The error bars represent the standard deviation over the 276 comparisons between
models. Each row of plots constitutes the plots for a given dataset, noted on the far left, and each column
of plots is for a given metric, noted at the top. Note that for image datasets, (FMNIST and Colon), we
plot SSIM instead of Spearman’s Ranking Coefficient (ρ). The x-axis is the number of models in the
ensemble, starting with one, and the y-axis indicates the value of the similarity metric averaged over all
276 comparisons of individual points’ in the validation split’s attributions. The red and orange lines depict
regular ensembles, and the green and blue represent selective ensembles."
