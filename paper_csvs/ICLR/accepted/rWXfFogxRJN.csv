ABSTRACT,0.004672897196261682,"Data augmentation is an effective way to improve the generalization capability of
modern deep learning models. However, the underlying augmentation methods
mostly rely on handcrafted operations. Moreover, an augmentation policy use-
ful to one dataset may not transfer well to other datasets. Therefore, Automated
Data Augmentation (AutoDA) methods, like AutoAugment and Population-based
Augmentation, have been proposed recently to automate the process of search-
ing for optimal augmentation policies. However, the augmentation policies found
are not adaptive to the dataset used, hindering the effectiveness of these AutoDA
methods. In this paper, we propose a novel AutoDA method called AdaAug to ef-
ﬁciently learn adaptive augmentation policies in a class-dependent and potentially
instance-dependent manner. Our experiments show that the adaptive augmenta-
tion policies learned by our method transfer well to unseen datasets such as the Ox-
ford Flowers, Oxford-IIT Pets, FGVC Aircraft, and Stanford Cars datasets when
compared with other AutoDA baselines. In addition, our method also achieves a
state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets.1"

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.014018691588785047,"Data augmentation is a common way to enhance the robustness of deep learning models by aug-
menting the datasets used for model training. Applying popular data augmentation operations such
as randomized cropping, horizontal ﬂipping, and color shifting to image data has become a standard
procedure in modern image recognition models (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Shorten & Khoshgoftaar,
2019). Over the years, various augmentation methods using advanced operations have been pro-
posed. Examples include occlusion-based operations like Cutout (Devries & Taylor, 2017) that ran-
domly masks part of an image to avoid overﬁtting, label-mixing operations like CutMix (Yun et al.,
2019) that replaces the occluded part in Cutout with a different image patch, and Mixup (Zhang
et al., 2018) that interpolates two images with their corresponding one-hot encoded labels."
INTRODUCTION,0.018691588785046728,"While these hand-crafted data augmentation methods can improve model generalization, choosing
the operations and their corresponding parameters is often decided manually to make the augmen-
tation scheme effective for the task at hand. Despite the manual efforts involved, an augmentation
policy that is useful for a particular dataset does not often generalize well to other datasets (Cubuk
et al., 2019). To tackle this problem, a series of recent studies has been conducted to automate
the process of ﬁnding an effective data augmentation policy for a target dataset. These automated
data augmentation (AutoDA) methodologies show impressive results on several benchmark image
datasets (Cubuk et al., 2019; Ho et al., 2019; Lim et al., 2019; Cubuk et al., 2020; Hataya et al.,
2020; Hendrycks et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Cheung & Yeung, 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.02336448598130841,"The manual tuning of augmentation parameters can also be addressed by using generative ap-
proaches, such as training a generative adversarial network (GAN) to create new artiﬁcial images
directly (Antoniou et al., 2017; Tran et al., 2017; Jha & Cecotti, 2020; Yorioka et al., 2020; Zhao
et al., 2020). However, these generative models are often hard to implement and computationally
expensive to train."

INTRODUCTION,0.037383177570093455,"In supervised learning, data augmentation is considered to be a naive way to inject inductive biases,
such as translational invariance, to a classiﬁer. With the recent advances in representation learning,
data augmentation has become a major approach to the learning of good representations. For exam-
ple, there is an increasing trend to replace convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transformers
in computer vision (Carion et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Being a more generic architecture,
transformers do not come with additional inductive bias such as translational invariance in CNNs,
thereby requiring more data to learn the effective invariance properties. Data augmentation serves
as an effective way to achieve this goal (Touvron et al., 2020). In addition, recent self-supervised
models rely heavily on data augmentation to create different views of the same data and learn the
robust representations through contrastive learning (Chen et al., 2020; Grill et al., 2020; He et al.,
2020). However, an improper choice of augmentation operations, especially with excessive strength,
may impose a wrong inductive bias to the models and lead to performance degradation (Chen et al.,
2020; Xiao et al., 2021). Consequently, there is a need to enrich the current data augmentation meth-
ods, especially with a better choice of the data augmentation policy, to take advantage of the recent
advances in representation learning."
INTRODUCTION,0.04205607476635514,"Previous AutoDA methods attempt to ﬁnd an optimal augmentation policy to augment a given
dataset. However, most of the discovered policies are not adaptive to variations of the dataset.
Even in a dataset in which an augmentation policy is found to be effective, the same augmentation
scheme is applied equally to all classes. This can limit the potential of data diversity brought about
by data augmentation. For example, in digit classiﬁcation, ﬂip-invariance is useful for the digits
“0”, “1” and “8” but not for the other digits; in shape classiﬁcation, shearing-invariance is useful for
“triangles” but not for “rectangles”. None of the previous AutoDA methods can learn an adaptive
class-dependent augmentation policy. To address this limitation, we propose AdaAug, as an Au-
toDA method, to learn a class-dependent and potentially instance-dependent augmentation policy
efﬁciently."
INTRODUCTION,0.04672897196261682,"Despite the attractive potential of such an adaptive scheme if it can indeed be realized, actually learn-
ing an adaptive augmentation policy poses at least two major technical challenges. First, the search
space for the per-class, per-instance augmentation policies is very large, rendering it intractable
when trying to maintain an individual policy for each class or even each realization of the input data.
Second, the gradient information of the augmentation parameters is hard to obtain as the operation
selection process and the transformations are non-differentiable. Optimizing the augmentation pol-
icy efﬁciently is a challenging problem to address. In this work, AdaAug employs a recognition
model to learn the underlying augmentation policy for each data instance and takes an alternating
exploit-and-explore procedure to update the augmentation policy using a differentiable workﬂow. In
the exploitation pass, AdaAug trains a classiﬁer for a number of steps, followed by the exploration
pass which validates the classiﬁer and updates the policy to minimize the validation loss. The intu-
ition behind our design of AdaAug is that such an alternating procedure can learn augmentations
that help generalize the trained model to unseen validation data. For example, rotational invariance
would be found to be a desirable inductive bias that the model should learn if the validation set
contains some similar but rotated versions of the training images. Our goal is to capture such infor-
mation and assign a higher probability to use rotation for augmentation in this case. An application
scenario would be a computer vision task for drones where the unseen data may contain different
kinds of rotated images. To summarize, our contributions are listed as follows:"

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.0794392523364486,"Automated Data Augmentation. Several AutoDA methods have been proposed to compose the
augmentation operations automatically. AutoAugment (Cubuk et al., 2019) learns to generate the
probability and magnitude when applying different augmentation operations as a policy using re-
inforcement learning (RL). It alternately generates an augmentation policy to train a child model
and updates the policy generator using the validation performance as a reward. Since it is com-
putationally expensive to train the child models repeatedly, several techniques have been proposed
subsequently in an attempt to reduce the search effort. Fast AutoAugment (Lim et al., 2019) uses
Bayesian optimization (BO) to tune the augmentation parameters. Population-based Augmentation
(PBA) (Ho et al., 2019) exploits population-based training (PBT) to search for an optimal augmen-
tation policy schedule by training multiple parallel child models using an evolutionary approach.
RandAugment (Cubuk et al., 2020) applies the augmentation operations uniformly and reduces the
search space signiﬁcantly by covering only the number of operators and the global augmentation
magnitude. Instead of using the validation performance to evaluate the augmentation quality, Ad-
versarial AutoAugment (Zhang et al., 2020) uses an adversarial objective to learn the augmentation
policy. MODALS (Cheung & Yeung, 2021) utilizes PBA to search for an optimal latent space aug-
mentation policy and augment data from any modality not limited to image data."
RELATED WORK,0.08411214953271028,"Differentiable Data Augmentation. In addition to using RL, BO and PBT to optimize the augmen-
tation parameters, there exist related methods that modify the otherwise discrete search procedures
to make them end-to-end differentiable. This results in a more efﬁcient optimization procedure and
a more precise policy than RL and PBT as the search space is continuous. In AdaAug, part of
our contribution is to design a differentiable workﬂow to learn the augmentation policy. For pre-
vious differentiable augmentation approaches, Faster AutoAugment (Hataya et al., 2020) proposes
a differentiable Relaxed Bernoulli distribution to sample the candidate augmentation functions and
estimate the gradients of the non-differentiable augmentation magnitude using the Stop Gradient es-
timator. Speciﬁcally, it optimizes a density matching loss between the training and validation data.
DADA (Li et al., 2020) differentiates through the discrete policy sampling process using Gumbel-
Softmax trick. While AutoDA and differentiable data augmentation have been shown to be success-
ful in improving the generalization performance of deep learning models, the learned augmentation
policy is often applied uniformly to the whole dataset, meaning that all classes and instances share
the same augmentation policy. On the contrary, each class and even each data instance receives an
adaptive policy to augment in our proposed method."
RELATED WORK,0.08878504672897196,"Adaptive Data Augmentation. Attempts have been made to apply adaptive data augmentation at a
class or subgroup level. Hauberg et al. (2016) model the transformations within each class and use
statistical models to augment the dataset. The approach shows improvement in the small MNIST
dataset and its variants. However, the augmentation operations are limited to spatial transforma-
tions. In addition, observations of the data must be locatable and alignable, making it difﬁcult to
extend to most other computer vision tasks. Recently, CAMEL (Goel et al., 2021) adopts a ﬁner
data-generation method by ﬁxing the classiﬁers that fail on a subgroup of a class. It uses CycleGAN
to learn different variations of the same training data within a subgroup. However, CAMEL re-
quires the specifying of the subgroup information manually and assumes that the subgroups only
exist within the same class. MetaAugment (Zhou et al., 2021) learns a sample-wise weighting
scheme and a global probability parameter to control the sampling of augmentation transformations.
In AdaAug, the learned policy can capture class-dependent transformation automatically and also
instance-dependent information, such as the light intensity of an image, across different classes."

dataset using a small model and then applies the learned policy network πθ to train with a larger

inference time. Regarding this workﬂow, RandAugment argues that the different search spaces in
search time and inference time makes the augmentation policy unable to adjust the regularization
strength to different target datasets and models (Cubuk et al., 2020). Therefore, it proposes to search
for the global magnitude and number of operators for each case. To address this concern, AdaAug
utilizes three diversity parameters to ﬁne-tune the regularization strength of the found policy for
large datasets and models. First, the number of operators k is set to 1 at search time, but a larger
value of k can be used at inference time. To control the selection of more diverse operations, a

and ﬁne-tuning the ResNet-50 model on the Flowers, Pets, Aircraft, and Cars datasets, respectively.
These baselines apply the same augmentation policy to all datasets. Such a policy may not be optimal
to the target domain. In contrast, AdaAug adapts the augmentation policy to individual image classes
and instances automatically. The AdaAug policy network applies different augmentation policies
to unseen images according to their similarity to the classes that AdaAug has seen in the search. To
further justify our claim, we show the distribution of the augmentation parameters for different tasks
in Appendix A.5.4. The four datasets have many classes but few training examples per class. The
negative effect of using a non-adaptive data augmentation policy is likely to be more imminent than
a situation where its dataset has fewer classes but more examples per class."

ADAAUG-DIRECT,0.4205607476635514,"CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The policies learned by AdaAug mostly achieve either comparable or
better performances than the baselines for both WRN-40-2 and WRN-28-10 models on the CIFAR-
10 and CIFAR-100 datasets (see Table 3). We visualize the augmentation policy of CIFAR-10 by
applying the policy to the validation data and averaging the predicted augmentation probability of
each image for each class (see Figure 2). The policy contains all types of augmentations at some
degree. Among the operations, Flip dominates the policy. It is in line with the augmentation se-
lected manually as people ﬁnd applying horizontal ﬂipping to CIFAR-10 can improve the prediction
accuracy. The policy learned by AdaAug puts higher emphasis on Invert and Equalize, which are
also reported by PBA. The focus on Brightness is also aligned with the policy in AutoAugment. Al-
though there are minor variations in the importance of some operations between the policies learned
by AdaAug, AutoAugment, and PBA, their empirical performance is similar."
ADAAUG-DIRECT,0.4252336448598131,"SVHN. AdaAug performs comparably to the baselines on the core set of SVHN. We visualize
the augmentation policy for SVHN in Figure 2. We found that AutoContrast, Invert, and Solarize
receive much attention in SVHN. This makes sense because the speciﬁc color of the number and
background is irrelevant to the prediction. This is consistent with the ﬁndings by AutoAugment and
PBA. The Flip operation receives a signiﬁcantly higher probability in digits “0”, “1”, and “8”. It is
likely because these three digits appear similar after ﬂipping. This shows that AdaAug captures not
only a dataset-speciﬁc augmentation policy, but also class-dependent augmentation, which cannot
be achieved by other baselines. In addition to the augmentation probability, we visualize the learned
augmentation magnitude in Appendix A.5.2."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.48130841121495327,"Instance-dependent augmentation. The AdaAug-direct results show that the learned AdaAug pol-
icy can capture dataset- and class-dependent augmentations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.
We further investigate whether AdaAug can learn instance-dependent information. According to
the architecture, AdaAug takes the output from the last layer of a CNN network as the image rep-
resentation and uses it to predict the augmentation parameters. The image representation contains
the class information and potentially some image features. Empirically, we ﬁrst examine if AdaAug
generates different augmentation policies for different instances even within the same class. In Ap-
pendix A.5.3, we plot the standard deviations of the predicted augmentation probabilities of the
image instances for each class. It is observed that even within the same class, the predicted aug-
mentation policy is slightly different across instances. It is a clue that the AdaAug policy captures
some instance-level augmentation information. Qualitatively, we show the augmented examples of
a ﬂower image using the AdaAug policy in Figure 3. The input image is relatively darker than the
other images. Apparently, AdaAug is aware of this property and applies more brightness-related
augmentation to lighten up the image. We observe similar behaviour of AdaAug in other classes,
but there is inadequate empirical support to conclude a general rule on how the network decides the
instance-aware augmentation as policies are learned in a data-driven way."

DISCUSSION,0.5046728971962616,"Quality of augmented data. We compare the augmented images from AdaAug with RandAugment
under different augmentation strengths in Figure 3. In terms of augmentation diversity, RandAug-
ment produces more variations of the input image. However, not all augmented images produced are
plausible. As RandAugment applies the augmentations uniformly, some augmented ﬂower images
show a strange color difference to the original image. With an increasing number of operators and
magnitude, the ﬂower object is sometimes translated out of the frame and results in a black image.
This may affect the learning performance as color can be an important feature in classifying different
species of ﬂowers. For AdaAug, the augmented images are more visually appealing."
DISCUSSION,0.5093457943925234,"Ablation study. In this section, we study the effects of AdaAug-transfer on Oxford 102 Flowers
and AdaAug-direct on CIFAR-10 using three alternative search conﬁgurations. First, does the use
of a nonlinear projection deliver a better performance? We replace the linear layer in h with a
2-layer MLP using a 128 hidden layer size with ReLU activation. Second, we study whether the
class-dependent and instance-dependent conﬁguration improves model accuracy. We remove the
class and instance information by replacing the policy network with a ﬁxed vector, which decides
the augmentation probabilities and magnitudes for the entire dataset. In the third setting, we mix the
augmented images in the input space instead of the latent space and observe the effects. Our results
show that the use of class- and instance-adaptive augmentation policies contribute larger improve-
ments in AdaAug-direct. In AdaAug-transfer, using a nonlinear projection harms the prediction
performance. A possible reason is that the nonlinear projection is more likely to overﬁt the search
dataset and fail to generalize to unseen datasets. Moreover, combining the augmentation path in the
latent space learns a better policy (see Table 4)."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5327102803738317,"In this work, we propose a novel AutoDA approach, AdaAug, to learn class- and instance-adaptive
augmentation policies efﬁciently. We demonstrate that the found policy transfers well to unseen
datasets while achieving state-of-the-art results on the seen datasets. We provide evidence to show
that the learned adaptive policy captures class- and instance-level information.
We think that
AdaAug can show further gains over existing baselines when applied to datasets with more dis-
similar underlying augmentation rules among the data classes, and with fewer training examples for
each class. It is also promising to investigate in the future if the proposed adaptive augmentation
method can improve the performance of other computer vision and representation learning tasks."

transformations, for example Colour, Invert and Solarize are less preferred in the Flower and Pet
datasets, while shearing operations are relatively more favourable in the Car and Aircraft dataset.
The observation of using less color transformation for the Flower dataset aligns with the ﬁndings
from Lee et al. (2021). Although some differences in the augmentation distributions may be less"

LIMITATIONS"
REFERENCES,0.9813084112149533,"Although AdaAug is differentiable and efﬁcient in search, it requires forming different augmen-
tation paths and passing the images through each path. Compared to standard training, where we
forward b images in one mini-batch, AdaAug processes b · |T| images in the exploration pass. At
inference time, AdaAug keeps a pre-trained policy network (πθ) to augment the new dataset. This
adds extra computational effort when compared to other AutoDA policies, which may be a concern
if the image resolution and model size are large but the computational resources are limited."
