ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.004,"Equivariant neural networks enforce symmetry within the structure of their con-
volutional layers, resulting in a substantial improvement in sample efﬁciency
when learning an equivariant or invariant function. Such models are applicable
to robotic manipulation learning which can often be formulated as a rotationally
symmetric problem. This paper studies equivariant model architectures in the con-
text of Q-learning and actor-critic reinforcement learning. We identify equivariant
and invariant characteristics of the optimal Q-function and the optimal policy and
propose equivariant DQN and SAC algorithms that leverage this structure. We
present experiments that demonstrate that our equivariant versions of DQN and
SAC can be signiﬁcantly more sample efﬁcient than competing algorithms on an
important class of robotic manipulation problems."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.012,"A key challenge in reinforcement learning is to improve sample efﬁciency – that is to reduce the
amount of environmental interactions that an agent must take in order to learn a good policy. This
is particularly important in robotics applications where gaining experience potentially means inter-
acting with a physical environment. One way of improving sample efﬁciency is to create “artiﬁcial”
experiences through data augmentation. This is typically done in visual state spaces where an afﬁne
transformation (e.g., translation or rotation of the image) is applied to the states experienced during
a transition (Laskin et al., 2020a; Kostrikov et al., 2020). These approaches implicitly assume that
the transition and reward dynamics of the environment are invariant to afﬁne transformations of the
visual state. In fact, some approaches explicitly use a contrastive loss term to induce the agent to
learn translation-invariant feature representations (Laskin et al., 2020b; Zhan et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.016,"Recent work in geometric deep learning suggests that it may be possible to learn transformation-
invariant policies and value functions in a different way, using equivariant neural networks (Cohen
& Welling, 2016a;b). The key idea is to structure the model architecture such that it is constrained
only to represent functions with the desired invariance properties. In principle, this approach aim at
exactly the same thing as the data augmentation approaches described above – both methods seek
to improve sample efﬁciency by introducing an inductive bias. However, the equivariance approach
achieves this more directly by modifying the model architecture rather than by modifying the train-
ing data. Since with data augmentation, the model must learn equivariance in addition to the task
itself, more training time and greater model capacity are often required. Even then, data augmenta-
tion results only in approximate equivariance whereas equivariant neural networks guarantee it and
often have stronger generalization as well (Wang et al., 2020b). While equivariant architectures have
recently been applied to reinforcement learning (van der Pol et al., 2020a;b; Mondal et al., 2020),
this has been done only in toy settings (grid worlds, etc.) where the model is equivariant over small
ﬁnite groups, and the advantages of this approach over standard methods is less clear."
INTRODUCTION,0.02,"This paper explores the application of equivariant methods to more realistic problems in robotics
such as object manipulation. We make several contributions. First, we deﬁne and analyze an im-
portant class of MDPs that we call group-invariant MDPs. Second, we introduce a new variation
of the Equivariant DQN (Mondal et al., 2020), and we further introduce equivariant variations of
SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018), and learning from demonstration (LfD). Finally, we show that our"

2020a; Kostrikov et al., 2020; Laskin et al., 2020b; Zhan et al., 2020). Our Equivariant SAC method,
in particular, outperforms these baselines so dramatically (Figure 7) that it could make reinforcement
learning feasible for a much larger class of robotics problems than is currently the case. Supplemen-

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.036,"Equivariant Learning: Encoding symmetries in the structure of neural networks can improve both
generalization and sample efﬁciency. The idea of equivariant learning is ﬁrst introduced in G-
Convolution (Cohen & Welling, 2016a). The extension work proposes an alternative architecture,
Steerable CNN (Cohen & Welling, 2016b). Weiler & Cesa (2019) proposes a general framework for
implementing E(2)-Steerable CNNs. In the context of reinforcement learning, Mondal et al. (2020)
investigates the use of Steerable CNNs in the context of two game environments. van der Pol et al.
(2020b) proposes MDP homomorphic networks to encode rotational and reﬂectional equivariance of
an MDP but only evaluates their method in a small set of tasks. In robotic manipulation, Wang et al.
(2021) learns equivariant Q-functions but is limited in the spatial action space. In contrast to prior
work, this paper proposes an Equivariant SAC algorithm, an equivariant LfD algorithm, and a novel
variation of Equivariant DQN (Mondal et al., 2020) focusing on visual motor control problems."
RELATED WORK,0.04,"Data Augmentation: Another popular method for improving sample efﬁciency is data augmenta-
tion. Recent works demonstrate that the use of simple data augmentation methods like random crop
or random translate can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of reinforcement learning (Laskin
et al., 2020a; Kostrikov et al., 2020). Data augmentation is often used for generating additional sam-
ples (Kalashnikov et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2020) in robotic manipulation. However,
data augmentation methods are often less sample efﬁcient than equivariant networks because the
latter injects an inductive bias to the network architecture."
RELATED WORK,0.044,"Contrastive Learning: Data augmentation is also applied with contrastive learning (Oord et al., 2018)
to improve feature extraction. Laskin et al. (2020b) show signiﬁcant sample-efﬁciency improvement
by adding an auxiliary contrastive learning term using random crop augmentation. Zhan et al. (2020)
use a similar method in the context of robotic manipulation. However, contrastive learning is limited
to learning an invariant feature encoder and is not capable of learning equivariant functions."
RELATED WORK,0.048,"Close-Loop Robotic Control: There are two typical action space deﬁnitions when learning policies
that control the end-effector of a robot arm: the spatial action space that controls the target pose
of the end-effector (Zeng et al., 2018b;a; Satish et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a), or the close-loop
action space that controls the displacement of the end-effector. The close-loop action space is widely
used for learning grasping policies (Kalashnikov et al., 2018; Quillen et al., 2018; Breyer et al., 2019;
James et al., 2019). Recently, some works also learn more complex policies than grasping (Viereck
et al., 2020; Kilinc et al., 2019; Cabi et al., 2020; Zhan et al., 2020). This work extends prior works
in the close-loop action space by using equivariant learning to improve the sample efﬁciency."

EQUIVARIANT DQN,0.22,"In DQN, we assume we have a discrete action space, and we learn
the parameters of a Q-network that maps from the state onto ac-
tion values. Given a G-invariant MDP, Proposition 4.1 tells us that
the optimal Q-function is G-invariant. Therefore, we encode the
Q-function using an equivariant neural network that is constrained
to represent only G-invariant Q-functions. First, in order to use
DQN, we need to discretize the action space. Let Aequiv ⊂Aequiv
and Ainv ⊂Ainv be discrete subsets of the full equivariant and
invariant action spaces, respectively. Next, we deﬁne a function
Fa : Aequiv →RAinv from the equivariant action variables in
Aequiv to the Q values of the invariant action variables in Ainv.
For example, in the robotic manipulation domain described Sec-
tion 4.2, we have Aequiv = Axy and Ainv = Aλ × Az × Aθ and
ρequiv = ρ1, and we deﬁne Aequiv and Ainv accordingly. We now
encode the Q network q as a stack of equivariant layers that each
encode the equivariant constraint of Equation 3. Since the compo-
sition of equivariant layers is equivariant, q satisﬁes:"

equivariance constraint for the robotic manipulation example with |Aequiv| = |Axy| = 9. When
the state (represented as an image on the left) is rotated by 90 degrees, the values associated with
the action variables in Axy are also rotated similarly. The detailed network architecture is shown in
Appendix D.1. Our architecture is different from that in Mondal et al. (2020) in that we associate
the action of g on Aequiv and Ainv with the group action on the spatial dimension and the channel

approximates Q values in the typical way. However, the
actor Π : S →A × Aσ estimates both the mean and stan-
dard deviation of action for a given state. Here, we deﬁne
Aσ = Rk to be the domain of the standard deviation vari-
ables over the k-dimensional action space deﬁned in Sec-

equivariance relation for ¯A, we must deﬁne how the group operator g ∈G acts on aσ ∈Aσ. Here,
we make the simplifying assumption that aσ is invariant to the group operator. This choice makes
sense in robotics domains where we would expect the variance of our policy to be invariant to the
choice of reference frame. As a result, we have that the group element g ∈G acts on ¯a ∈¯A via:"

is associated with an α-vector. Since ¯s has a regular representation, we have g¯s = ρreg(g)¯s. Writing
the equivariance constraint of Equation 3 for e, we have that e must satisfy e(gFs) = ge(Fs) = g¯s.
The output state representation ¯s is concatenated with the action a ∈A, producing w = (¯s, a). The
action of the group operator is now gw = (g¯s, ga) where ga = (ρequiv(g)aequiv, ainv). Finally, the q
network maps from w onto R, a real-valued estimate of the Q value for w. Based on proposition 4.1,
this network must be invariant to the group action: q(gw) = q(w). All together, the critic satisﬁes

augmentation (baseline details in Appendix E). All methods use a SO(2) data augmentation buffer,
where every time a new transition is added, we generate 4 more augmented transitions by applying
random continuous rotations to both the image and the action (this data augmentation in the buffer
is in addition to the data augmentation that is performed in the RAD DrQ, and FERM baselines).
Prior to each training run, we pre-load the replay buffer with 20 episodes of expert demonstration."

EQUIVARIANT SACFD"
EQUIVARIANT SACFD,0.404,"We want to explore our equivariant methods in the context of more challenging tasks such as those in
the bottom row of Figure 5. However, since these tasks are too difﬁcult to solve without some kind
of guided exploration, we augment the Equivariant SAC as well as all the baselines in two ways: 1)
we use SACfD as described in Section 5.3; 2) we use Prioritized Experience Replay (Schaul et al.,
2015) rather than standard replay buffer. As in Section 6.2, we use the SO(2) data augmentation in
the buffer that generates 4 extra SO(2)-augmented transitions whenever a new transition is added.
Figure 8 shows the results. First, note that our Equivariant SACfD does best on all four tasks,
followed by FERM, and other baselines. Second, notice that only the equivariant method can solve
the last three (most challenging tasks). This suggests that equivariant models are important not only
for unstructured reinforcement learning, but also for learning from demonstration. Additional results
for Block Pulling and Object Picking environments are shown in Appendix G."

to learn SO(2) equivariance using SO(2) data augmentation. Here, we explore this idea as an
alternative to our equivariant model. Speciﬁcally, instead of augmenting on the state as in Laskin
et al. (2020a) and Kostrikov et al. (2020) using only translation, we apply the SO(2) augmentation
in both the state and the action. Since the RAD and DrQ baselines in this section are already
running SO(2) augmentations themselves, we disable the SO(2) buffer augmentation for the online
transitions in those baselines. (See the result of RAD and DrQ with the SO(2) data augmentation
buffer in Appendix H.4). We compare the resulting version of RAD (RAD SO(2) SACfD) and DrQ
(DrQ SO(2) SACfD) with our Equivariant SACfD in Figure 9. Our method outperforms both RAD

GENERALIZATION EXPERIMENT,0.444,"This experiment evaluates the ability for the
equivariant model to generalize over the equiv-
ariance group. We use a similar experimental
setting as in Section 6.3. However, now the
training environment is always initialized with
a ﬁxed orientation rather than a random ori-
entation. For example, in Block Pulling, the
two blocks are initialized with a ﬁxed relative
orientation; in Drawer Opening, the drawer is
initialized with a ﬁxed orientation. In the eval-
uation environment, however, these objects are
initialized with random orientations. To suc-
ceed, the agent needs to generalize over varied orientations while being trained with a ﬁxed orienta-
tion. To prevent the agent from generalizing via augmentation, we disable the SO(2) augmentation
in the buffer. As shown in Figure 10, Equivariant SACfD generalizes better than the baselines. Even
though the equivariant network is presented with only one orientation during training, it successfully
generalizes over random orientation whereas none of the baselines can."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.452,"This paper deﬁnes a class of group-invariant MDPs and identiﬁes the invariance and equivariance
characteristics of their optimal solutions. This paper further proposes Equivariant SAC and a new
variation of Equivariant DQN for continuous action space and discrete action space, respectively. We
show experimentally in the robotic manipulation domains that our proposal substantially surpasses
the performance of competitive baselines. A key limitation of this work is that our deﬁnition of
G-invariant MDPs requires the MDP to have an invariant reward function and invariant transition
function. Though such restrictions are often applicable in robotics, they limit the potential of the
proposed methods in other domains like some ATARI games. Furthermore, if the observation is
from a non-top-down perspective, or there are non-equivariant structures in the observation (e.g.,
the robot arm), the invariant assumptions of a G-invariant MDP will not be directly satisﬁed."

the size of 128 × 128. The contrastive encoder of CURL baselines has a size of 128 as in Laskin
et al. (2020b), and that for the FERM baselines has a size of 50 as in Zhan et al. (2020). The FERM
baseline’s contrastive encoder is pretrained for 1.6k steps using the expert data as in Zhan et al.
(2020). The DrQ (Kostrikov et al., 2020) Shift baselines use random shift of ±4 pixels for data aug-
mentation as in the original work. In all DrQ baselines, the number of augmentations for calculating
the target K and the number of augmentations for calculating the loss M are both 2 as in Kostrikov
et al. (2020)."

TRAINING DETAILS"
REFERENCES,0.856,"We implement our experimental environments in the PyBullet simulator (Coumans & Bai, 2016).
The workspace’s size is 0.4m×0.4m×0.24m. The pixel size of the visual state I is 128×128 (except
for the RAD Crop baselines, CURL baselines, and FERM baselines, where I’s size is 142 × 142
and will be cropped to 128 × 128). I’s FOV is 0.6m × 0.6m. During training, we use 5 parallel
environments. We implement all training in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017). Both DQN and SAC use
soft target update with τ = 10−2."

USING EQUIVARIANT NETWORK ONLY IN ACTOR OR CRITIC"

applying it in the actor network or the critic network. We evaluate four variations: 1) Equi Actor +
Equi Critic that uses equivariant network in both the actor and the critic; 2) Equi Actor + CNN Critic
that uses equivariant network solely in the actor and uses conventional CNN in the critic; 3) CNN
Actor + Equi Critic that uses conventional CNN in the actor and equivariant network in the Critic;

Pulling, the two blocks in the training environment is initialized with a ﬁxed relative orientation;

conventional CNN) equipped with the data augmentation buffer. As is mentioned in Section 6.2, the
data augmentation baseline creates 4 extra augmented transitions using random SO(2) rotation every
time a new transition is added. Figure 18 shows the result, where none of the baselines outperform
our proposal in any tasks. Compared with Figure 9, the data augmentation buffer hurts RAD and
DrQ because of the redundancy of the same data augmentation."
