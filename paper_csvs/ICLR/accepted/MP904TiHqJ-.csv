ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.002617801047120419,"In this paper, we study the problem of ﬁnding mixed Nash equilibrium for mean-
ﬁeld two-player zero-sum games. Solving this problem requires optimizing over
two probability distributions. We consider a quasistatic Wasserstein gradient ﬂow
dynamics in which one probability distribution follows the Wasserstein gradient
ﬂow, while the other one is always at the equilibrium. Theoretical analysis are
conducted on this dynamics, showing its convergence to the mixed Nash equilib-
rium under mild conditions. Inspired by the continuous dynamics of probabil-
ity distributions, we derive a quasistatic Langevin gradient descent method with
inner-outer iterations, and test the method on different problems, including train-
ing mixture of GANs."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.007853403141361256,"Finding Nash equilibrium has seen many important applications in machine learning, such as gener-
ative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014a) and reinforcement learning (Busoniu
et al., 2008). In these problems, pure Nash equilibria are usually search for a function f(x, y). Yet,
the problems arising from machine learning are usually nonconvex in x and nonconcave in y, in
which case pure Nash equilibrium may not exist. And even if it exists, there is no guarantee for any
optimization algorithm to ﬁnd it efﬁciently. This difﬁculty is reﬂected in practice, that compared
with simple minimization, machine learning applications involving Nash equilibria usually have
more complicated behaviors and more subtle dependence on hyper-parameters. For example, stable
and efﬁcient training of GANs requires a number of carefully designed tricks (Gao et al., 2018)."
INTRODUCTION,0.010471204188481676,"On the other hand, the mixed Nash equilibrium (MNE) is known to exist in much more general set-
tings, e.g. when the strategy spaces are compact and the payoff function is continuous (Glicksberg,
1952). In the mixed Nash equilibrium problem, instead of taking “pure strategies” x and y, two
”mixed strategies” for x and y, in the form of probability distributions, are considered, resulting in
the following functional,
Z
f(x, y)p(x)q(y)dxdy,"
INTRODUCTION,0.013089005235602094,"where p and q are density functions of probability distributions of x and y, respectively. Efforts
are invested to develop theoretically endorsed algorithms that can efﬁciently ﬁnd MNE for high
dimensional problems, with applications on the training of mixture of GANs. In Hsieh et al. (2019),
a mirror-descent algorithm is proposed and its convergence is proven. In Domingo-Enrich et al.
(2020), theoretical analysis and empirical experiments are conducted for a gradient descent-ascent
ﬂow under a Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric and its particle discretization."
INTRODUCTION,0.015706806282722512,"In this paper, we also consider the mixed Nash equilibrium problem, and propose a simple Qua-
siStatic Wasserstein Gradient Flow (QSWGF) for solving the problem. In our dynamics, we treat
q as a component with much faster speed than p, hence is always at equilibrium as p moves. With
entropy regularization for both p and q (without requirement on the strength of the regularizations),
we prove that the QSWGF converges to the unique mixed Nash equilibrium from any initialization
(under mild conditions). Furthermore, we show there is a simple way to discretize the QSWGF, re-
gardless of the complexity of the Wasserstein gradient ﬂow of p induced by the fact that q is always"

and we ﬁnd an efﬁcient way to approximate the partition function. By discretizing the QSWGF,
we derive a particle dynamics with an inner-outer structure, named the QuasiStatic Langevin Gra-
dient Descent algorithm (QSLGD). In QSLGD, after each iteration of the outer problem (for the x
particles), the inner loop conducts sufﬁcient iterations to bring the y particles to equilibrium. Nu-
merical experiments show the effectiveness of QSLGD on synthetic examples and training mixture
of GANs. Our method outperforms the vanilla Langevin gradient descent-ascent method when the
entropy regularization is weak."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.034031413612565446,"The mixed Nash equilibrium problem has a long history, with the proof of its existence dates back
to Morgenstern & Von Neumann (1953). It draws new attention in recent years, especially in the
machine learning community, due to the development of GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014a) and ad-
versarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2014b). Training mixture of GANs is already discussed in
paper (Goodfellow et al., 2014a). Some numerical experiments were conducted in (Arora et al.,
2017). In Grnarova et al. (2017), the authors proposed an online learning approach for training mix-
ture of GANs, and proved its effectiveness for semi-shallow GANs (GANs whose discriminator is
a shallow neural network). Yet, rigorous theoretical treatment to an algorithm started from (Hsieh
et al., 2019), in which a mirror descent method was studied and proven to converge. The imple-
mentation of the mirror descent method involves big computational cost that asks for heuristics to
alleviate. Later, (Domingo-Enrich et al., 2020) studied more efﬁcient algorithms under a mixture of
Wasserstein and Fisher-Rao metrics. Theoretically, the time average of the dynamics’ trajectories is
shown to converge to the mixed Nash equilibrium. As a comparison, in this work we show the global
convergence of the quasistatic Wasserstein gradient ﬂow without the need of taking time average.
Meanwhile, the Wasserstein nature of our dynamics makes it easy to implement as well."
RELATED WORK,0.03664921465968586,"The Wasserstein gradient ﬂow in the density space has been explored in previous works. For exam-
ple, (Wang & Li, 2019) studied the Nesterov’s accelerated gradient ﬂows for probability distributions
under the Wasserstein metric, and (Arbel et al., 2019) studied practical implementations of the natu-
ral gradient method for the Wasserstein metric. Both works focus on minimization problems instead
of min-max problems considered in this work. A more related work is Lin et al. (2021b), where a
natural gradient based algorithm is proposed for training GANs. Yet, the method still optimizes one
generator and one discriminator, searching for pure Nash equilibrium. Another work that derives
algorithms for GANs from a Wasserstein perspective is (Lin et al., 2021a)."
RELATED WORK,0.03926701570680628,"Another volume of works that studies the Wasserstein gradient ﬂow in the machine learning con-
text is the mean-ﬁeld analysis of neural networks. This line of works started from two-layer neural
networks (Mei et al., 2018; Rotskoff & Vanden-Eijnden, 2018; Chizat & Bach, 2018; Sirignano &
Spiliopoulos, 2020), to deep fully-connected networks (Ara´ujo et al., 2019; Sirignano & Spiliopou-
los, 2021; Nguyen, 2019; Wojtowytsch et al., 2020), and residual networks (Lu et al., 2020; E et al.,
2020). The mean-ﬁeld formulations treat parameters as probability distributions, and the training
dynamics are usually the gradient ﬂow under Wasserstein metric. Attempts to prove convergence of
the dynamics to global minima are made (Mei et al., 2018; Chizat & Bach, 2018; Rotskoff et al.,
2019), though in the case without entropy regularization a convergence assumption should usually
be made a priori."

β is large. We can also see better tolerance to large β when more inner iterations are conducted.
This shows the advantage of the QSLGD over LGDA when the regularization stength is weak. The
middle ﬁgures shows slightly better performance of the QSLGD when the step length η (both ηx
and ηy) is small. However, when η is big, LGDA tends to give smaller error. The results may be
caused by the instability of the inner loop when η is big. It also guides us to pick small step length
when applying the proposed method. Finally, the right ﬁgure compares the inﬂuence of the number

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.4397905759162304,"In this paper, we study the quasistatic Wasserstein gradient ﬂow for the mixed Nash equilibrium
problem. We theoretically show the convergence of the continuous dynamics to the unique Nash
equilibrium. Then, a quasistatic particle method is proposed by discretizing the continuous dynam-
ics. The particle method consists of two nested loops, and conduct sufﬁcient inner loop in each step
of the outer loop. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the method. Comparison with
LGDA shows the proposed method has advantage over LGDA when β is large (which is usually the
case of interest), and performs as good as LGDA in most other cases."
DISCUSSION,0.4424083769633508,"Theoretical extensions are possible. For example, strong convergence results may be established by
similar approaches taken in (Feng & Li, 2020). We leave this as future work."
DISCUSSION,0.44502617801047123,"In practice, the idea of nested loops is not new for minimax optimization problems. It is already
discussed and utilized in the earliest works for GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014a), and Wasserstein
GANs (Arjovsky et al., 2017). In those works, the discriminator is updated for several steps each
time the generator is updated. Our work is different from these works because we consider mixed
Nash equilibrium and hence our method is particle based, while their method searches for pure Nash
equilibrium."
DISCUSSION,0.4476439790575916,"Finally, though particle methods ﬁnding mixed Nash equilibria have stronger theoretical guarantees,
applying these methods to the training of GANs faces the problem of computational cost. With both
the generator and discriminator being large neural networks, training mixture of GANs with many
generators and discriminators imposes formidable computational cost. Developing more efﬁcient
particle methods for GANs is an important future work."
