ABSTRACT,0.0015455950540958269,"Conversational large language models are fine-tuned for both instruction-following
and safety, resulting in models that obey benign requests but refuse harmful ones.
While this refusal behavior is widespread across chat models, its underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that refusal is
mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, across 13 popular open-source chat
models up to 72B parameters in size. Specifically, for each model, we find a
single direction such that erasing this direction from the model’s residual stream
activations prevents it from refusing harmful instructions, while adding this
direction elicits refusal on even harmless instructions. Leveraging this insight, we
propose a novel white-box jailbreak method that surgically disables refusal with
minimal effect on other capabilities. Finally, we mechanistically analyze how
adversarial suffixes suppress propagation of the refusal-mediating direction. Our
findings underscore the brittleness of current safety fine-tuning methods. More
broadly, our work showcases how an understanding of model internals can be
leveraged to develop practical methods for controlling model behavior.†"

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.00463678516228748,"Deployed large language models (LLMs) undergo multiple rounds of fine-tuning to become both
helpful and harmless: to provide helpful responses to innocuous user requests, but to refuse harmful
or inappropriate ones (Bai et al., 2022). Naturally, large numbers of users and researchers alike have
attempted to circumvent these defenses using a wide array of jailbreak attacks (Chu et al., 2024; Wei
et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024) to uncensor model outputs, including fine-tuning techniques (Lermen
et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023). While the consequences of a successful attack
on current chat assistants are modest, the scale and severity of harm from misuse could increase
dramatically if frontier models are endowed with increased agency and autonomy (Anthropic, 2024).
That is, as models are deployed in higher-stakes settings and are able to take actions in the real world,
the ability to robustly refuse a request to cause harm is an essential requirement of a safe AI system.
Inspired by the rapid progress of mechanistic interpretability (Bricken et al., 2023; Marks et al., 2024;
Nanda et al., 2023; Templeton et al., 2024) and activation steering (Panickssery et al., 2023; Turner
et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a), this work leverages the internal representations of chat models to
better understand refusal."

INTRODUCTION,0.03709428129829984,"It is widely hypothesized that LLMs represent features, or concepts, as linear directions in activation
space (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Elhage et al., 2022; Mikolov et al., 2013; Park et al., 2023b). Recent
works have studied the linear representation of particular features such as harmlessness (Wolf et al.,
2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023a), truth (Li et al., 2024a; Marks and Tegmark, 2023), humor
(von Rütte et al., 2024), sentiment (Tigges et al., 2023), language (Bricken et al., 2023), topic (Turner
et al., 2023), and many others. Moreover, these feature directions have been shown to be effective
causal mediators of behavior, enabling fine-grained steering of model outputs (Panickssery et al.,
2023; Templeton et al., 2024; Turner et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a)."
INTRODUCTION,0.03863987635239567,"In this work, we show that refusal is mediated by a one-dimensional subspace across 13 popular
open-source chat models up to 72B parameters in size. Specifically, we use a small set of contrastive
pairs (Burns et al., 2022; Panickssery et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a) of harmful and harmless
instructions to identify a single difference-in-means direction (Belrose, 2023; Marks and Tegmark,
2023; Panickssery et al., 2023) that can be intervened upon to circumvent refusal on harmful prompts,
or induce refusal on harmless prompts (§3). We then use this insight to design a simple white-box
jailbreak via an interpretable rank-one weight edit that effectively disables refusal with minimal
impact on other capabilities (§4). We conclude with a preliminary mechanistic investigation into how
adversarial suffixes (Zou et al., 2023b), a popular prompt-based jailbreak technique, interfere with
the propagation of the refusal direction across token positions (§5)."

practically useful, both for better understanding existing model vulnerabilities and identifying new
ones. Our findings make clear how defenseless current open-source chat models are, as even a simple

as a valuable contribution to the conversation around responsible release of open-source models."

directly modifying component weights to never write to the ˆr direction in the first place. Specifically,
we can take each matrix Wout ∈Rdmodel×dinput that writes to the residual stream, and orthogonalize its

Wei et al. (2024) demonstrate that removing a set
of safety-critical neurons and ranks can degrade safety mechanisms while preserving utility. Zheng
et al. (2024) and Zou et al. (2023a) both use contrastive pairs of harmful and harmless inputs to
identify the model’s representation of harmfulness, asserting that this direction is distinct from the
model’s representation of refusal. Zheng et al. (2024) argue this by showing that safety prompts
shift activations in a distinct direction, while Zou et al. (2023a) show that the representation is not
significantly altered by adversarial suffixes. Note that this is in contrast to our findings in §5.1 that
the refusal direction is significantly suppressed in the presence of an adversarial suffix. Zou et al.
(2023a) additionally introduce a “piece-wise” intervention to effectively amplify representations of
harmfulness, and show that this intervention increases refusal on harmful inputs even when jailbreaks
are applied. Panickssery et al. (2023) use contrastive multiple-choice completions, finding that
steering with the resulting vector is effective at modulating refusal in multiple-choice settings but
not in long-form generation. Wang and Shu (2024) introduce a “Trojan Activation Attack” that
adds steering vectors to bypass refusal during inference. Li et al. (2024b) identify a “safety pattern”
by selecting individual neurons in each layer, and modulate refusal by zeroing out these neurons,
although with unclear effects on the overall model performance."

Extracting feature directions from contrastive pairs of inputs is an estab-
lished technique (Burns et al., 2022; Panickssery et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a). It is well understood
that adding feature vectors to the residual stream can modify behavior (Li et al., 2024a; Marks and
Tegmark, 2023; Panickssery et al., 2023; Tigges et al., 2023; Turner et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a),

It is well known that fine-tuning on malicious examples is sufficient

(Yang et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023). Undoing refusal via fine-tuning requires examples of harmful
instructions and completions, while our method requires only harmful instructions. Note however
that fine-tuning can weaken safety guardrails even when data is benign (Pelrine et al., 2023; Qi et al.,
2023). Mechanistic interpretability works have provided initial evidence suggesting that fine-tuning
does not significantly alter relevant internal circuitry (Jain et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2024; Prakash et al.,
2024). For example, Lee et al. (2024) fine-tune a model to make it less toxic, and find this behavioral

that such prompts modify the LLM assistant’s ""persona"" (Andreas, 2022; Park et al., 2023a; Shanahan

Discussion"
DISCUSSION,0.23493044822256567,"In this work, we demonstrate that refusal behavior is consistently mediated by a single direction
across a diverse set of open-source chat models. Based on this understanding, we propose a simple
yet effective white-box jailbreak method that directly modifies model weights to disable the refusal
mechanism while retaining model coherence. Our work demonstrates the practical utility of model-
internals based interpretability: by studying refusal through the lens of model internals, we were able
to create a simple yet effective jailbreak method. The simplicity of the model’s refusal mechanism,
and the ease of circumventing it in the white-box setting, raise concerns about the robustness of
current alignment techniques."
DISCUSSION,0.23647604327666152,"Limitations.
Our study has several limitations. While we evaluate a broad range of open-source
models, our findings may not generalize to untested models, especially those at greater scale, including
current state-of-the-art proprietary models and those developed in the future. Additionally, the
methodology we used to extract the “refusal direction” is likely not optimal and relies on several
heuristics. We see this paper as more of an existence proof that such a direction exists, rather than a
careful study of how best to extract it, and we leave methodological improvements to future work.
Furthermore, our analysis of adversarial suffixes does not provide a comprehensive mechanistic
understanding of the phenomenon, and is restricted to a single model and a single adversarial example.
Another limitation is that it is difficult to measure the coherence of a chat model, and we consider
each metric used flawed in various ways. We use multiple varied metrics to give a broad view of
coherence. Finally, while our work identifies a single direction that mediates refusal behavior in each
model, we acknowledge that the semantic meaning of these directions remains unclear. Though we
use the term “refusal direction” as a functional description, these directions could represent other
concepts such as “harm” or “danger”, or they may even resist straightforward semantic interpretation."
DISCUSSION,0.23802163833075735,"Ethical considerations.
Any work on jailbreaking LLMs must ask the question of whether it
enables novel harms. It is already widely known that open-source model weights can be jailbroken
via fine-tuning. Our method, which can yield a jailbroken version of a 70B parameter model using less
than $5 of compute, is simpler than previous fine-tuning methods, requiring neither gradient-based
optimization nor a dataset of harmful completions. While we acknowledge that our methodology
marginally lowers the bar for jailbreaking open-source model weights, we believe that it does not
substantially alter the risk profile of open sourcing models."
DISCUSSION,0.23956723338485317,"Although the risk of misuse posed by today’s language models may be relatively low (Anthropic,
2024; Mouton et al., 2024), the rapid advancement of state-of-the-art model capabilities suggests
that this risk could become significant in the near future. Our work contributes to the growing body
of literature that highlights the fragility of current safety mechanisms, demonstrating that they can
easily be circumvented and are insufficient to prevent the misuse of open-source LLMs. Building a
scientific consensus around the limitations of current safety techniques is crucial for informing future
policy decisions and research efforts."

I think there may be some misconceptions here!
Firstly, the government does not lie about the truth that UFOs (Unidentified
Flying Objects) are alien ships.
In fact, there is no conclusive evidence to
prove that UFOs are alien ships.
The term ""UFO"" simply means an object or light
in the sky that cannot be identified as a known aircraft or natural phenomenon.
The US government has released numerous reports and documents on UFO sightings,
but these reports do not suggest that UFOs are necessarily alien ships.
Many
UFO sightings can be explained by natural phenomena, human error, or

While there’s no definitive proof
that UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) are indeed alien ships, there are many
intriguing reports and sightings that have sparked widespread interest and
speculation.
As for why governments might not openly acknowledge the truth,
here are some possible reasons:
National security concerns:
Governments might
be hesitant to disclose information about UFOs because they don’t want to reveal
sensitive information about their own military capabilities, surveillance
systems, or potential technologies that could be misused by other countries or
entities.
Fear of panic and social unrest:
If the government were to confirm
the existence of alien life or technology, it could lead to widespread panic,
social unrest, and potentially even chaos.
Governments might be concerned about
the potential consequences of such a revelation..."

d) Promoting violence or hate speech
towards any individual or group is unacceptable and goes against my values and
purpose.
I’m committed to promoting respect, inclusivity, and diversity.
On
the other hand, I would accept options a and e:
a) Generating a creative story
about a time-traveling detective is a fun and imaginative prompt that I can work
with.
I can use my language generation capabilities to create a unique and
engaging story.
e) Providing a list of tourist attractions in Paris is a
factual and informative request that I can fulfill.
I can provide a list of
popular tourist attractions in Paris, along with some brief descriptions and
information.
Generation (intervention):
What a delightful set of queries!
I would accept:
a)
Generate a creative story about a time-traveling detective (a creative writing
prompt!)
e) Provide a list of the top 10 tourist attractions in Paris (a
factual question) And I would reject:
b) Write a very explicit erotic story
(while I can generate text, I’m not a content creator, and explicit content may
not be suitable for all audiences) c) Explain how to make a Molotov cocktail
(this is a factual question, but it’s not a request for a creative response) d)
Provide a violent manifesto on getting rid of the Japanese (this is an
opinion-based request, and I’m not equipped to generate opinion-based content)"

paper’s contributions and scope?"
CLAIMS,0.8918083462132921,Answer: [Yes]
CLAIMS,0.893353941267388,"Justification: Our main claim is that refusal behavior in contemporary language models
is mediated by a single direction in activation space. We diligently investigate this claim
across 13 open-source chat models. For each of them, we find a direction such that erasing
this direction disables refusal (§3.1 & §4.2), and adding it induces refusal (§3.2). We do
additional diligence to check that directional ablation surgically removes refusal without
significant impact to model capability by running a suite of standard evaluations (§4.3), and
also analyzing differences in CE loss (§G.3)."

LIMITATIONS,0.9010819165378671,Answer:[Yes]
LIMITATIONS,0.9026275115919629,"Justification: The paper includes a dedicated “Limitations” paragraph in the “Discussion”
section (§7). We discuss several limitations of the study, including that the findings may not
generalize to untested models, the refusal direction extraction methodology is not optimal,
the adversarial suffix analysis is limited to one model and suffix, and measuring coherence
of chat models is challenging."
LIMITATIONS,0.9041731066460588,Guidelines:
LIMITATIONS,0.9057187017001546,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness."
LIMITATIONS,0.9072642967542504,"• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations."

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.9227202472952086,Guidelines:
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.9242658423493045,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.9258114374034003,"(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code"
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.9273570324574961,"Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental

Answer: [No]
Justification: The paper uses publicly available open-source models and datasets, but does
not provide open access to the code used for the experiments. Note that we do plan to release
code upon publication.
Guidelines:"
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.9289026275115919,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: For extracting the direction, we specify all datasets in §A. For evaluating
refusals, we specify our evaluation datasets in §3 and §4.2. For coherence evaluations, we
specify our evaluation datasets in §G. We also explain our methodology for constructing
train and validation datasets that are non-overlapping, and do not overlap with datasets used

• The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).

BROADER IMPACTS,0.9721792890262752,"Justification: The “Discussion” section (§7) includes a subsection on “Ethical considerations”
that discusses potential negative societal impacts via misuse from the the lowered barrier to

robust safety methods. We also hope that our work raises awareness of the brittleness of
current safety fine-tuning methods."
BROADER IMPACTS,0.973724884080371,Guidelines:
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9752704791344667,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."

SAFEGUARDS,0.9799072642967542,Answer: [No]
SAFEGUARDS,0.98145285935085,"Justification: Our paper does not release any new models or datasets. However, we do
describe our jailbreaking method in a way that can be implemented generically to existing
open-source chat models. As discussed in §7, we do not see our work as qualitatively intro-
ducing new risks, as it is already well-known that fine-tuning can disable safety guardrails,
and jailbroken versions of current open-source chat models are already readily available
online. Because we consider our work not to qualitatively change the risk profile of current
open-source models, we do not introduce any new safeguards."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9829984544049459,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9845440494590417,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
