ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.006172839506172839,"The paper studies the convergence properties of a zero-order multidimensional
stochastic optimization algorithm with a constant step-size. An estimate of the
finite time convergence error is given. The operation of the algorithm is illustrated
by the simulation of the spacecraft spatial position adjustment within a satellite
constellation, which is relevant in controlling the orientation of an interferometric
mega-constellation space telescope under conditions of uncertainty."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.018518518518518517,"Algorithm can be used with two possible step size selection strategies: a constant step size strategy
and an adaptive step size. Initially, the works considered an algorithm with a variable step size.
Choosing the step size is also a major challenge. In practice, the step size affects the accuracy. The
algorithm SPSA allows to solve many problems in different areas where optimization of a function
of a large number of parameters is required and when it is expensive to calculate the objective
function for a long time. SPSA is used for study of variational quantum algorithms Periyasamy et al.
(2024), in Experimental verification of active oscillation controller for vehicle drivetrain Yonezawa
et al. (2024) , The properties of the algorithm are still being researched Zago et al. (2024) and
the algorithm is developing and shows its advantages when compared with others Dieleman et al.
(2024) the algorithm is used in optimization of CO2 flooding for Enhanced Oil Recovery Liu et al.
(2024) also for tuning for flight control system of morphing arm octorotor Kose (2024) Since the
level of interference and its statistic properties is not known in advance, a constant step-size could
be considered as a better option to achieve a globally optimal solution."

ALGORITHM"
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.14814814814814814,"In case of presence of systematic error in the model a method should be chosen that gives unbiased
estimates under these conditions. A stochastic approximation method, based on SPSA algorithm
introduced by Spall Spall (1992), is capable of providing estimates under an unknown-but-bounded
noise Granichin & Amelina (2015). In case the noise is random the knowledge of distribution
and its parameters is not required, apart from upper bound of the second raw moment, to provide
efficient estimates of the required variable. If the noise is not random it is only required to know an
upper bound on the difference of subsequent noise values. Such variety in possible noise is caused
by the usage of the randomized input ∆n which is required to be independent of the noise. This
property allows to cancel the bias induced by external disturbance when estimating the mathematical
expectation of the parameter deviation. It should be noted that in theory it is not always easy to prove
the required independence of the randomized input and the noise. However, in practice it is quite
reasonable to assume the independence of the generated random values and external disturbances
affecting the considered object."

APPLICATION FOR ORIENTATION IMPROVEMENT OF INTERFEROMETRIC
MEGA-CONSTELLATION SPACE TELESCOPE"
OTHER,0.6851851851851852,"The main tasks of the telescope are: to collect radiation that falls on the mirror system, with mini-
mal losses, and also obtain the most accurate image of the object. If the radiation is collected with
significant errors, then the image will be disturbed. An important and time-consuming part of im-
age acquisition is the precise tuning of the radio telescope antenna (or systems consisting of such
antennas). The quality of the image obtained on a radio telescope directly depends on the quality
of the construction of a reflecting system of mirrors that focuses the radiation coming from outside.
To improve the image quality, it is necessary to focus the radiation of the device in such a way that
it works as accurately as possible, especially if it is located in space. Conventional antenna tuning
algorithms are sufficient. However, they lose their effectiveness under uncontrolled unpredictable
external influences such as deformations of the radio telescope shields that arise due to environmen-
tal influences e.g. temperature changes, wind etc. Moreover, if we consider an autonomous system
representing a grouping of spacecraft, the relevance of the approach used is obvious. In particular,
the SPSA algorithm can be applied to improve the orientation of a megaconstellation interferometric
space telescope such as Knapp et al. (2024)"

OTHER,0.7777777777777778,"At the same time, if one moves along an ideal reflective surface, its local characteristics change.
Therefore, a real reflective surface composed of identical elements will repeat deviations from the
ideal surface from element to element. These deviations will be greater, if the shape of the surface
of the element differs from the shape of that portion of the ideal surface which this element should
represent. If the size of the reflective elements increases, then the deviations naturally increase.
These deviations comprise an error distributed over the reflector of a variable profile antenna, which,
at large values, creates unacceptable distortions reducing the efficiency of the antenna. We will call
vn the signal power measurement errors arising due to unknown and uncontrolled deformations in
the reflective elements of the antenna caused by weather, wind, and temperature changes."
OTHER,0.7839506172839507,"After conventional procedures for adjusting the inclination angles and positions of the radio tele-

is still a necessity of tuning in a certain neighborhood of ˆθ0 to obtain the optimal value θ⋆corre-
sponding to the maximum power of the received signal. For adjustment, we could use a stochastic
optimization algorithm with two measurements per iteration, which allows us to reduce the negative
impact of various disturbances on the power of the recorded signal.

placed in space in such a way that the reflected signal from the mirrors is focused in a small area

circular paraboloid which, due to its properties, focuses the parallel beams in a single point. The
satellites equipped with the sensors could adjust their relative positions and the mirrors orientation
to form a paraboloid. However, due to the errors caused by measurement and the natural phenomena
the mirror system needs to be adjusted for better focusing."

The graph in Fig. 1 shows the signal power in the receiver computed according equation 28. The
graph is constructed by averaging the results of 40 simulations. After converging to the maximum
value the algorithm continues to fluctuate due to input randomization. The experiments show strong
dependence on step-size parameter value which has to be carefully adjusted to achieve fast and
monotonous convergence behavior."
