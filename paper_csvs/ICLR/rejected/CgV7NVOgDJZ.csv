ABSTRACT,0.004366812227074236,"Most neural text-to-speech (TTS) models require ⟨speech, transcript⟩paired data
from the desired speaker for high-quality speech synthesis, which limits the us-
age of large amounts of untranscribed data for training. In this work, we present
Guided-TTS, a high-quality TTS model that learns to generate speech from un-
transcribed speech data. Guided-TTS combines an unconditional diffusion prob-
abilistic model with a separately trained phoneme classiﬁer for text-to-speech.
By modeling the unconditional distribution for speech, our model can utilize the
untranscribed data for training. For text-to-speech synthesis, we guide the gener-
ative process of the unconditional DDPM via phoneme classiﬁcation to produce
mel-spectrograms from the conditional distribution given transcript. We show that
Guided-TTS achieves comparable performance with the existing methods with-
out any transcript for LJSpeech. Our results further show that a single speaker-
dependent phoneme classiﬁer trained on multispeaker large-scale data can guide
unconditional DDPMs for various speakers to perform TTS."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.013100436681222707,"Neural text-to-speech (TTS) models have been achieved to generate high-quality human-like speech
given text (van den Oord et al. (2016); Shen et al. (2018)). In general, these TTS models are condi-
tional generative models that encode text into the hidden representation and generate speech from
the encoded representation. Early TTS models are autoregressive generative models which generate
high-quality speech but suffer from slow synthesis speed due to the sequential sampling procedure
(Shen et al. (2018); Li et al. (2019)). Owing to the development of non-autoregressive generative
models, recent TTS models are capable of generating high-quality speech with faster inference speed
(Ren et al. (2019); Ren et al. (2021); Kim et al. (2020); Popov et al. (2021)). Recently, high-quality
end-to-end TTS models have been proposed that generate raw waveform from the text at once (Kim
et al. (2021); Weiss et al. (2021); Chen et al. (2021b))."
INTRODUCTION,0.017467248908296942,"Despite the high-quality and fast inference speed of speech synthesis, most TTS models can be
trained only if the transcribed data of the desired speaker is given. While long-form untranscribed
data, such as audiobooks or podcasts, is available on various websites, it is challenging to use these
unpaired speech data to train existing TTS models. To utilize these untranscribed data, long-form
untranscribed speech data has to be segmented into sentence-level, and then each segmented speech
should be transcribed accurately. Since the existing TTS models must directly model the conditional
distribution of speech given text, the direct usage of untranscribed data remains challenging to solve."
INTRODUCTION,0.021834061135371178,"In this work, we propose Guided-TTS, an unconditional diffusion-based generative model trained
on untranscribed data that leverages a phoneme classiﬁer for text-to-speech synthesis. Trained on
untranscribed speech data for the desired speaker, our unconditional diffusion probabilistic model
learns to generate mel-spectrograms of the speaker without any context. As training data does not
have to be aligned with text sequence for unconditional speech modeling, we simply use random
chunks of untranscribed speech to train our unconditional generative model. This allows us to build
training data without extra effort in modeling the speech of speakers for which only long-form
untranscribed speech data is available."

mance without seeing any transcript of LJSpeech, which shows the possibility to build a high-quality
text-to-speech model without a transcript for the desired speaker. We encourage the readers to listen

and guides the unconditional model to generate speech with a given text. To the best of our knowl-

GUIDED-TTS,0.1965065502183406,"Both unconditional speech modeling and controllable generation with the unconditional generative

unconditional DDPM for TTS, which requires transcribed data for training."
GUIDED-TTS,0.20087336244541484,"In Guided-TTS, the generative model and the phoneme classiﬁer are trained separately so that we can
utilize different datasets to train each module. For instance, assume only the untranscribed speech

trained on other transcribed datasets that contain rich, large-scale multi-speaker data. The phoneme
classiﬁer trained in such a manner effectively guides the generative model, trained only using the
untranscribed speech data of the target speaker. By doing so, with the two modules independent of
each other, we can achieve the text-to-speech model without any transcript of the target speaker."

RELATED WORK,0.5414847161572053,"Text-to-Speech Models Most text-to-speech (TTS) models are composed of two parts: a model
that generates intermediate features (e.g., mel-spectrogram) from text (Shen et al. (2018)) and the
vocoder, which synthesizes raw waveforms from intermediate features (van den Oord et al. (2016)).
The autoregressive model is used for the text-to-intermediate feature model (Wang et al. (2017);
Shen et al. (2018); Ping et al. (2018); Li et al. (2019)) and vocoder (van den Oord et al. (2016);
Kalchbrenner et al. (2018)) to perform high-quality TTS. Since the autoregressive models generate
samples in a sequential manner, their inference speed is slow. Thus, various parallel TTS mod-
els have been proposed to improve the sampling speed. Flow-based generative models (Kingma &
Dhariwal (2018)) and feed-forward models have been proposed for text-to-mel-spectrogram models
(Ren et al. (2019); Ren et al. (2021); Kim et al. (2020); Shih et al. (2021)) and vocoders (Oord et al.
(2018); Prenger et al. (2019); Kim et al. (2019)). Also, variational autoencoder (Kingma & Welling

perform conditional generation tasks using transcribed speech data of the target speaker. We propose
a new TTS model that learns to generate speech of the target speaker using untranscribed data and
guides it through a phoneme classiﬁer trained with other transcribed datasets. By guiding the uncon-

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5633187772925764,"In this work, we present Guided-TTS, a new type of TTS model that generates speech given tran-
script by guiding the unconditional diffusion-based model for speech. As Guided-TTS models un-
conditional distribution for speech, the proposed model can construct a TTS model using the desired
speaker’s untranscribed data. Thanks to the properties of diffusion-based generative models, our
unconditional generative model can generate a speech when a transcript is given by introducing
the separately trained phoneme classiﬁer. To the best of our knowledge, Guided-TTS is the ﬁrst
TTS model to leverage the unconditional generative model for speech. We showed that Guided-TTS
matches the performance of the previous TTS models on LJSpeech. Moreover, Guided-TTS without
the transcript of the target speaker generates samples comparable to existing models using tran-
scripts by training its phoneme classiﬁer on a large-scale multi-speaker dataset. We also showed that
the single well-performed phoneme classiﬁer can guide various unconditional DDPMs to generate
high-quality sample. We believe that Guided-TTS can reduce the burden of constructing training
datasets for high-quality TTS."

speaker (ID: 6097) from Hi-Fi TTS and a female speaker from LJSpeech. Two cross-shaped masks
(LJSpeech, Hi-Fi TTS male) and one binarized MNIST (LeCun & Cortes (2010)) mask (Hi-Fi TTS

duration predictor, and we train MFA to extract the alignment using the same dataset used to train
the phoneme classiﬁer and duration predictor."
R T,0.9388646288209607,"For both Guided-TTS-T and Guided-TTS-U, the unconditional models are trained with batch size
16 for all datasets. The duration predictor is trained for 20 epochs with batch size 64. The phoneme
classiﬁer of Guided-TTS-T uses a WaveNet-like structure with 256 residual channels, 6 residual
blocks stacks of 3 dilated convolution layers, and is trained for 1000 epochs with batch size 64. For
Guided-TTS-U, we use a WaveNet-like structure with 512 residual channels, 3 residual blocks stacks
of 6 dilated convolution layers for the phoneme classiﬁer, and it is trained for 140 epochs with batch
size 64. The speaker encoder is a two-layer LSTM with 768 channels followed by a linear projection
layer to extract 256-dimensional speaker embedding eS, and trained for 300K iterations."

HARDWARE AND SAMPLING SPEED"
R T,0.9519650655021834,"We conduct all experiments and evaluations using NVIDIA’s RTX 8000 with 48GB memory. Al-
though our model is not focused on fast inference, Guided-TTS can perform real-time speech syn-
thesis on GPU for N = 50, which is the number of reverse steps we use for evaluation. We measure
the sampling speed of Guided-TTS using a real-time factor (RTF). We also measure how much
time it takes to compute the unconditional score (∇Xt log pθ(Xt)) and gradient of the classiﬁer
(∇Xt log pφ(ˆy|Xt)). Guided-TTS-T achieves an RTF of 0.56, of which 0.39 is used to calculate the
score and 0.16 is used for classiﬁer gradient calculation. Similarly, Guided-TTS-U achieves an RTF
of 0.63, 0.39 for computing the score and 0.23 for computing the gradient of the classiﬁer."

R T,0.9956331877729258,"2000)) using the
Eq. (3) for all 500 samples from the test set of the LJSpeech. We then obtain the norm of the
unconditional score and the gradient of the classiﬁer using the sampled Xt with the modules of
Guided-TTS-T. Each norm is averaged over 500 samples for each timestep. As shown in Fig. 4a,
the norm of the unconditional score rises steeply around t = 0. This is about 70 times larger than
the norm of the classiﬁer gradient near t = 0 (Fig. 4b), which signiﬁcantly reduces the effect of
the classiﬁer guidance. To alleviate this problem, we propose the norm-based guidance in Section
3.2.1, which helps prevent both the gradient of the classiﬁer from being ignored and the issue of
synthesized speech not matching the text."
