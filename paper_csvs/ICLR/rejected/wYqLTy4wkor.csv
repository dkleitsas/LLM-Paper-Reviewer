ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.005291005291005291,"In reinforcement learning (RL), adaptive curricula have proven highly effective
for learning policies that generalize well under a wide variety of changes to the
environment. Recently, the framework of Unsupervised Environment Design
(UED) generalized notions of curricula for RL in terms of generating entire
environments, leading to the development of new methods with robust minimax-
regret properties. However, in partially-observable or stochastic settings (those
featuring aleatoric uncertainty), optimal policies may depend on the ground-
truth distribution over the aleatoric features of the environment. Such settings
are potentially problematic for curriculum learning, which necessarily shifts the
environment distribution used during training with respect to the ﬁxed ground-
truth distribution in the intended deployment environment. We formalize this
phenomenon as curriculum-induced covariate shift, and describe how, when the
distribution shift occurs over such aleatoric environment parameters, it can lead to
learning suboptimal policies. We then propose a method which, given black-box
access to a simulator, corrects this resultant bias by aligning the advantage estimates
to the ground-truth distribution over aleatoric parameters. This approach leads to a
minimax-regret UED method, SAMPLR, with Bayes-optimal guarantees."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.015873015873015872,"Adaptive curricula, which dynamically adjust the distribution of training environments to optimize
the performance of the resulting policy, have played a key role in many recent achievements in
deep reinforcement learning (RL). Applications have spanned both single-agent RL (Portelas et al.,
2020; Wang et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2020; Justesen et al., 2018), where adaptation occurs over
environment variations, and multi-agent RL (MARL), where adaptation can additionally occur over
co-players (Silver et al., 2016; Vinyals et al., 2019; Stooke et al., 2021). By presenting the agent with
challenges at the threshold of its abilities, such methods demonstrably improve the sample efﬁciency
and the generality of the ﬁnal policy (Matiisen et al., 2017; Dennis et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2021b;a)."
INTRODUCTION,0.021164021164021163,"This work introduces a fundamental problem relevant to adaptive curriculum learning methods for RL,
which we call curriculum-induced covariate shift (CICS). Analogous to the covariate shift that occurs
in supervised learning (SL), CICS refers to a mismatch between the input distribution at training and
test time, and in this case, speciﬁcally when the distribution shift is caused by the selective sampling
performed by an adaptive curriculum. While there may be cases in which CICS impacts model
performance in SL, adaptive curricula for SL have generally not been found to be as impactful as in
RL (Wu et al., 2021). Therefore, here we focus on addressing this problem speciﬁcally as it arises in
the RL setting, and leave investigation of its potential impact in SL to future work."
INTRODUCTION,0.026455026455026454,"To establish precise language around adaptive curricula, we cast our discussion under the lens of
Unsupervised Environment Design (UED, Dennis et al., 2020). UED provides a formal problem
description for which curriculum learning is the solution, by deﬁning the Underspeciﬁed POMDP
(UPOMDP; see Section 2), which expands the classic POMDP with a set of free parameters Θ,
representing the dimensions along which the environment may vary across episodes. The goal of
UED is then to adapt distributions over Θ, so to maximize some objective, which could be tied to an
RL agent’s performance over this distribution. This allows us to view adaptive curricula as emerging
via a multi-agent game between a teacher that proposes environments with parameters θ ∼Θ and a
student that learns to solve them. In addition to the notational clarity it provides, this formalism lends"

INTRODUCTION,0.08465608465608465,"This game-theoretic view has led to the development of curriculum methods with principled robustness
guarantees, such as PAIRED (Dennis et al., 2020) and Prioritized Level Replay (PLR, Jiang et al.,
2021a), which showed that curricula optimizing for the student’s regret lead to minimax regret
(Savage, 1951) policies at Nash equilibria, implying the agent can solve all solvable environments
within the training domain. While other methods can also be cast in this framework, they do not hold
the same desirable property at equilibrium. For this reason, we will focus on addressing CICS for
regret-maximizing UED, but note that our solution can be used with other UED methods."
INTRODUCTION,0.08994708994708994,"To see how the CICS can be problematic, consider the simpliﬁed case of training a self-driving car
in simulation, so it learns to take the fastest route from home to ofﬁce. Suppose trafﬁc data shows
on 70% of the days, Route 1 is faster than Route 2. Moreover, on any given day the self-driving car
cannot infer which route is faster ahead of time, so always picking Route 1 is faster in expectation.
To support training a policy using an adaptive curriculum, one could build a simulator which sets
road conditions per episode based on a random day sampled from the trafﬁc data. However, adaptive
curriculum over the trafﬁc settings may oversample days when Route 1 is closed—perhaps because
it ﬁnds the agent needs more practice on Route 2—shifting the best choice to Route 2 in training.
In fact, methods for minimax regret UED like PLR would keep shifting the distribution of fastest
route, to maximize the agent’s regret. Their curriculum dynamics would map to the zero-sum game
of matching pennies, in which one player wins for guessing whether the other chose heads or tails;
the NE corresponds to each player randomly playing each option half the time. Randomly picking
the route in this way is suboptimal, because in reality Route 1 is faster in expectation. This example
is depicted in Figure 1, where the two routes are replaced by an apple and banana."
INTRODUCTION,0.09523809523809523,"If, on a given day, the faster route could be identiﬁed before having to pick one, the agent could
choose optimally. Instead, it is an aleatoric parameter, inducing irreducible uncertainty in the limit
of inﬁnite experiential data (Der Kiureghian & Ditlevsen, 2009). When CICS occurs over such
parameters, with respect to a ground-truth distribution of environments P(θ), the learned policy can
be suboptimal with respect to P. It can therefore be useful to ground—that is, to constrain—the
aleatoric parameters Θ′ ⊂Θ to P(θ′) when it is known or can be learned, as in simulation or from
real-world data. However, grounding all θ is undesirable, preventing the curriculum from sampling
enough opportunities to learn from useful scenarios with low support under P(θ)."

UNSUPERVISED ENVIRONMENT DESIGN"
UNSUPERVISED ENVIRONMENT DESIGN,0.12698412698412698,"The problem of Unsupervised Environment Design (UED, Dennis et al. (2020)) is the problem of
automatically generating an adaptive distribution of environments which will lead to policies that
successfully transfer within a target domain. The domain of possible environments is represented
by an Underspeciﬁed POMDP (UPOMDP), which adds a set of free parameters to the standard
deﬁnition of a POMDP, along which each concrete instantiation, or level, of the UPOMDP. For
instance, these free parameters can be the position of obstacles in a maze, or friction coefﬁcients
in a physics-based task. Formally a UPOMDP is deﬁned as a tuple M = ⟨A, O, Θ, S, T , I, R, γ⟩,
where A is a set of actions, O is a set of observations, Θ is a set of free parameters, S is a set of
states, T : S × A × Θ →∆(S) is a transition function, I : S →O is an observation (or inspection)
function, R : S →R is a reward function, and γ is a discount factor. UED typically approaches the
curriculum design problem as training a teacher agent that co-evolves an adversarial curriculum for a
student agent, for example, by maximizing the student’s regret."
UNSUPERVISED ENVIRONMENT DESIGN,0.13227513227513227,"We will focus on a recent UED algorithm called Robust Prioritized Level Replay (PLR⊥, Jiang
et al., 2021b), which performs environment design via random search. PLR maintains a buffer of
the most useful levels for training, according to some learning potential score—typically based on
a regret approximation, such as the positive value loss—and with probability p, actively samples
the next training level from this level buffer instead of the ground-truth training distribution. This
selective-sampling mechanism has been demonstrated to greatly improve sample-efﬁciency and
generalization in several domains, while provably leading to a minimax regret policy for the student
at NE. In maximizing regret, PLR curricula naturally avoid unsolvable levels, which have no regret."

OFF-BELIEF LEARNING"
OFF-BELIEF LEARNING,0.14285714285714285,"In cooperative MARL, self-play promotes the formation of cryptic conventions—arbitrary sequences
of actions that allow agents to communicate information about the environment state. These
conventions are learned jointly among all agents during training, but are arbitrary and hence,
indecipherable to independently-trained agents or humans at test time. Crucially, this leads to
policies that fail to perform zero-shot coordination (ZSC, Hu et al., 2020), where independently-
trained agents must cooperate successfully without additional learning steps, or ad-hoc team play.
Off-Belief Learning (OBL) resolves this problem by forcing agents to assume their co-players act
according to a ﬁxed, known policy π0 until the current time t, and optimally afterwards, conditioned
on this assumption. If π0 is playing uniformly random, this removes the possibility of forming
arbitrary conventions."

(AOH) for agent i be τ i = (Ii(s1), a1, ..., at−1, Ii(st)). Further, let π0 be an arbitrary policy, such
as a uniformly random policy, and Bπ0(τ|τ i) = P(τt|τ i

OBL’s ﬁctitious transition can be adapted to the single-agent curriculum learning setting to address

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.1746031746031746,"The mismatch between training and testing distributions of input features is referred to as covariate
shift, and has long served as a fundamental problem for the machine learning community. Covariate
shifts have been extensively studied in supervised learning (Vapnik & Chervonenkis, 1971; Huang
et al., 2006; Bickel et al., 2009; Arjovsky et al., 2019). In RL, prior works have largely focused
on covariate shifts due to training on off-policy data (Sutton et al., 2016; Rowland et al., 2020;
Espeholt et al., 2018; Hallak & Mannor, 2017; Gelada & Bellemare, 2019; Thomas & Brunskill,
2016) including the important case of learning from demonstrations (Pomerleau, 1988; Ross &
Bagnell, 2010). Recent work also aims to learn invariant representations robust to covariate shifts
(Zhang et al., 2019; 2021). More generally, CICS can be interpreted as a kind of sample-selection
bias (Heckman, 1979). We believe this work to be the ﬁrst to formalize and provide a solution to the
problem of covariate shifts in reinforcement learning due to curriculum learning."
RELATED WORK,0.17989417989417988,"Our method ﬁxes a critical ﬂaw that can cause curricula to fail under CICS—an important problem as
curricula have been shown to be essential for training RL agents across many of the most challenging
domains, including combinatorial gridworlds (Zhong et al., 2020), Go (Silver et al., 2016), StarCraft 2
(Vinyals et al., 2019), and achieving comprehensive task mastery in open-ended environments (Stooke
et al., 2021). While this work focuses on PLR, other recent methods include minimax adversarial
curricula (Wang et al., 2019; 2020) and curricula based on changes in return (Matiisen et al., 2017;
Portelas et al., 2020). Most similar to our work, OFFER (Ciosek & Whiteson, 2017) adapts a
curriculum over transition functions and uses importance sampling to correct for biased gradient
estimates. Unlike this work, Ciosek & Whiteson (2017) requires whitebox access to the transition
function and does not directly study the impact of CICS on the learning dynamics. Curriculum
methods have also been studied in goal-conditioned RL (Florensa et al., 2018; Campero et al., 2021;
Sukhbaatar et al., 2018; OpenAI et al., 2021), though CICS does not occur here as goals are observed
by the agent. Lastly, domain randomization (DR, Sadeghi & Levine, 2017; Peng et al., 2017) can
be seen as a degenerate form of UED, though curriculum-based extensions of DR have also been
studied (Jakobi, 1997; Tobin et al., 2017)."
RELATED WORK,0.18518518518518517,"Prior work has also investigated methods for learning Bayes optimal policies under uncertainty about
the task (Zintgraf et al., 2020; Osband et al., 2013), based on the framework of Bayes-adaptive
MDPs (BAMDPs) (Bellman, 1956; Duff, 2002). In this setting, the agent can adapt to an unknown
MDP over several episodes by acting to reduce its uncertainty about the identity of the MDP. In
contrast, SAMPLR learns a robustly Bayes optimal policy for the case of zero-shot transfer. Further
unlike these works, our setting assumes the distribution of certain aleatoric parameters are biased
during training, which would lead to biased a posteriori uncertainty estimates with respect to the
ground-truth distribution when optimizing for the BAMDP objective. Instead, SAMPLR proposes a
means to correct for this bias assuming knowledge of the true environment parameters for each level,
to which we can safely assume access in curriculum learning."

learn to behave optimally under some set of otherwise identiﬁable level parameters. This is distinct

UED, so as to still beneﬁt from a curriculum. To achieve this, we adapt the ﬁctitious transition to
single-agent curriculum learning by treating the UED teacher as a co-player—one that performs the

k=1 pairs to update a posterior model P(θ′|τ) that predicts

implement the ﬁctitious transition by setting θ′ ∼P(θ′) at the start of each episode; subsequent
transitions will then be consistent with B. For example, in the fruit choice example, whether apple
or banana was the right goal is deterministically revealed by the ﬁnal reward, and otherwise, does
not impact transition dynamics. Additionally, we often only have limited access to P(θ) throughout
training, for example, if sampling P(θ) is costly. In this case, we can learn an estimate ˆP(θ′) using

only learn to choose optimally in expectation at test time by grounding to the distribution of correct
choices in the deployment domain. Speciﬁcally, in each level, the agent must traverse between one to
eight randomly generated rooms, and in the ﬁnal room, the agent must choose to eat the apple or the
banana. The correct choice is ﬁxed for each level, but indiscernible to the agent. Thus, the identity of
the true goal acts as the aleatoric parameter. Figure 3 shows example levels from this environment."
EXPERIMENTS,0.5714285714285714,"This environment presents a hard exploration challenge for standard RL algorithms, as it requires
learning to both navigate multiple rooms, as well as the NLE-speciﬁc skills of kicking doors and
eating. The doors opening into adjacent rooms are locked. In order to go from one room to the next,
the agent must learn to, potentially repeatedly, kick the locked door until it opens. Likewise, upon
reaching a piece of fruit in the ﬁnal room, the agent must learn to deliberately choose to eat the fruit.
If the right choice of fruit were determinable per episode, we expect PLR⊥’s adaptive curriculum to
improve learning by selectively sampling levels at the threshold of the agent’s abilities."

EXPERIMENTS,0.582010582010582,"Let πA be the policy in which the agent always chooses the apple,
and πB, the banana. If the probability of the goal being apple
P(A) = q, the expected return of the agent is RAq under πA
and RB(1 −q) under πB. The optimal policy is then to act
according to πA when q > RB/(RA + RB), and according to πB
otherwise. We expect training under domain randomization, which
samples each level completely at random from the ground-truth
distribution P(θ), deﬁned by the environment parameterization,
would converge to the correct choice of πA or πB, assuming
the environment is learnable by the choice of RL algorithm. In
contrast, PLR evolves an adversarial curriculum, incentivizing
PLR to shift the distribution over goals throughout training. For
example, PLR is incentivized to ﬂip the curriculum distribution
to favor eating apples whenever the agent begins to consistently
succeed at eating bananas. We thus expect the PLR curriculum to
continually oscillate the preferred choice of goal."
EXPERIMENTS,0.5873015873015873,"In our experiments, we set RA = 3, RB = 10, and q in {0.7, 0.5, 0.3}, making it always optimal to
follow the banana-eating policy πB, but with the marginal beneﬁt of doing so varying with q. We
report train and test performance of each agent over 200M training steps in Figure 4. We ﬁnd that
DR struggles to learn an effective policy, plateauing at an expected return under 1.0; PLR performs
even worse, due to its adversarial curriculum shifting the distribution over the correct goal, leading to
rapid oscillations in the optimal choice of fruit under the curriculum distribution, as visible in the
high-variance oscillations in the proportion of apple goals selected by PLR for each value of q in 4).
This makes it difﬁcult for the agent to settle on the optimal policy with respect to any ground-truth
distribution. The proportion of each choice outcome, shown in Figure 5, reveals that both DR and
PLR policies fail to eat any fruit most of the time, even after 200M training steps. In contrast, both
SAMPLR and LP-SAMPLR realize a marked improvement in test performance by grounding PLR’s"

can capture reward signal, and which can then be made more complex to push the agent along its
threshold of abilities."
BANANA,0.6931216931216931,"We next turn to a more challenging environment that introduces additional NetHack-speciﬁc dynamics.
The FireDungeon environment (see Figure 6 for example levels), requires the agent to navigate through
up to 13 chambers, and ultimately choose between chamber A or B, each containing a valid goal.
Reaching this goal ends the episode and provides the agent with a sparse reward. Further, in this
penultimate chamber, there is an armor, which if worn grants the agent with ﬁre resistance with
probability q. Chamber B is marked by a red gemstone by the door and contains enemy units, whose
ﬁre attack will instantly kill the agent. Killing each enemy grants the agent with +1 ﬁnal reward,
which is only provided upon reaching either goal. The agent thus stands to attain a higher reward
by attacking the enemies in Chamber B, before reaching the goal, only if the armor is ﬁreproof.
This environment presents an even more difﬁcult exploration problem for the agent, yet we see in
Figure 6, both SAMPLR variants begin to learn to solve this environment with signiﬁcantly greater
sample-efﬁciency than DR, while PLR again struggles to learn. As in the case of the previous
stochastic choice environment, we see that PLR rapidly oscillates the key aleatoric parameter, which
in this case, determines whether the armor is ﬁreproof."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.7037037037037037,"Using the formal notions of environment parameterizations in the framework of UED, we deﬁned
the problem of curriculum-induced covariate shift in RL. Our deﬁnition highlights the issues that
can arise when there is persisitent uncertainty over the environment parameters, either because the
uncertainty is irreducible or because reducing the uncertainty is costly. We then adapted a ﬁctitious
transition mechanism previously used to improve zero-shot coordination in cooperative MARL to
correct for this covariate shift. We demonstrated that our resulting algorithm, SAMPLR, avoids the
pitfalls of this type of covariate shift, while preserving the beneﬁts of curriculum learning."
