ABSTRACT,0.0018148820326678765,"We present a detailed study of surrogate losses and algorithms for multi-label
learning, supported by H-consistency bounds. We ﬁrst show that, for the simplest
form of multi-label loss (the popular Hamming loss), the well-known consistent
binary relevance surrogate suffers from a sub-optimal dependency on the number of
labels in terms of H-consistency bounds, when using smooth losses such as logistic
losses. Furthermore, this loss function fails to account for label correlations. To
address these drawbacks, we introduce a novel surrogate loss, multi-label logistic
loss, that accounts for label correlations and beneﬁts from label-independent H-
consistency bounds. We then broaden our analysis to cover a more extensive
family of multi-label losses, including all common ones and a new extension
deﬁned based on linear-fractional functions with respect to the confusion matrix.
We also extend our multi-label logistic losses to more comprehensive multi-label
comp-sum losses, adapting comp-sum losses from standard classiﬁcation to the
multi-label learning. We prove that this family of surrogate losses beneﬁts from
H-consistency bounds, and thus Bayes-consistency, across any general multi-label
loss. Our work thus proposes a uniﬁed surrogate loss framework beneﬁting from
strong consistency guarantees for any multi-label loss, signiﬁcantly expanding
upon previous work which only established Bayes-consistency and for speciﬁc loss
functions. Additionally, we adapt constrained losses from standard classiﬁcation
to multi-label constrained losses in a similar way, which also beneﬁt from H-
consistency bounds and thus Bayes-consistency for any multi-label loss. We further
describe efﬁcient gradient computation algorithms for minimizing the multi-label
logistic loss."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.0054446460980036296,"Supervised learning methods often assign a single label to each instance. However, real-world data
exhibits a more complex structure, with objects belonging to multiple categories simultaneously.
Consider a video about sports training, which could be categorized as both ‘health’ and ‘athletics,’ or a
culinary blog post tagged with ‘cooking’ and ‘nutrition’. As a result, multi-label learning [McCallum,
1999, Schapire and Singer, 2000] has become increasingly important, leading to the development of
various interesting and effective approaches, predominantly experimental in nature, in recent years
[Elisseeff and Weston, 2001, Deng et al., 2011, Petterson and Caetano, 2011, Kapoor et al., 2012]."
INTRODUCTION,0.007259528130671506,"Although there is a rich literature on multi-label learning (see [Zhang and Zhou, 2013] and [Bo-
gatinovski et al., 2022] for detailed surveys), only a few studies focus on the theoretical analysis
of multi-label learning, particularly the study of the Bayes-consistency of surrogate losses [Zhang,
2004a,b, Bartlett et al., 2006, Tewari and Bartlett, 2007, Steinwart, 2007]."
INTRODUCTION,0.009074410163339383,"Gao and Zhou [2011] initiated the study of Bayes-consistency in multi-label learning with respect to
Hamming loss and (partial) ranking loss. They provided negative results for ranking loss, demonstrat-
ing that no convex and differentiable pairwise surrogate loss is Bayes-consistent for that multi-label
loss. They also showed that the binary relevance method, which learns an independent binary
classiﬁer for each of the l labels, is Bayes-consistent with respect to the Hamming loss. Dembczynski
et al. [2011] further demonstrated that under the assumption of conditionally independent labels, the
binary relevance method is also Bayes-consistent with respect to the Fβ measure loss. However, they
noted that it can perform arbitrarily poorly when this assumption does not hold. Dembczynski et al.
[2012] provided a positive result for the (partial) ranking loss by showing that the simpler univariate
variants of smooth surrogate losses are Bayes-consistent with respect to it. Additionally, Zhang et al.
[2020] proposed a family of Bayes-consistent surrogate losses for the Fβ measure by reducing the
Fβ learning problem to a set of binary class probability estimation problems. This approach was
motivated by the consistent output coding scheme in [Ramaswamy et al., 2014] for general multiclass
problems. Other works have studied generalization bounds in multi-label learning [Yu et al., 2014,
Wydmuch et al., 2018, Wu and Zhu, 2020, Wu et al., 2021, 2023, Busa-Fekete et al., 2022]."
INTRODUCTION,0.010889292196007259,"Another related topic is the characterization of the Bayes classiﬁer and corresponding Bayes-consistent
plug-in algorithm in multi-label learning. This includes the characterization of the Bayes classiﬁer
for subset 0/1 loss and Hamming loss in [Cheng et al., 2010] and the characterization of the Bayes
classiﬁer for F1 measure in [Dembczynski et al., 2011]. Dembczynski et al. [2013], Waegeman et al.
[2014] further extended the results in [Dembczynski et al., 2011] by designing a Bayes-consistent
plug-in algorithm for the Fβ measure. Koyejo et al. [2015] characterized the Bayes classiﬁer for
general linear fractional losses with respect to the confusion matrix and designed the corresponding
plug-in algorithms in the empirical utility maximization (EUM) framework. In this framework, the
measures are directly deﬁned as functions of the population, in contrast to a loss function that is
deﬁned as a function over a single instance in the decision theoretic analysis (DTA) framework [Ye
et al., 2012]. Menon et al. [2019] studied the Bayes-consistency of various reduction methods with
respect to Precision@κ and Recall@κ in multi-label learning. However, all these publications only
established Bayes-consistency for speciﬁc loss functions. Can we derive a uniﬁed surrogate loss
framework that is Bayes-consistent for any multi-label loss?"
INTRODUCTION,0.012704174228675136,"Furthermore, as Awasthi, Mao, Mohri, and Zhong [2022a,b] pointed out, Bayes-consistency is an
asymptotic guarantee and does not provide convergence guarantees. It also applies only to the family
of all measurable functions unlike the restricted hypothesis sets typically used in practice. Instead,
they proposed a stronger guarantee known as H-consistency bounds, which are both non-asymptotic
and account for the hypothesis set while implying Bayes-consistency. These guarantees provide upper
bounds on the target estimation error in terms of the surrogate estimation error. Can we leverage
this state-of-the-art consistency guarantee when designing surrogate loss functions for multi-label
learning?"
INTRODUCTION,0.014519056261343012,"Moreover, one of the main concerns in multi-label learning is label correlations (see [Dembczy´nski
et al., 2012]). For the simplest form of multi-label loss, the popular Hamming loss, the existing
Bayes-consistent binary relevance surrogate fails to account for label correlations. Can we design
consistent loss functions that effectively account for label correlations as well?"

Preliminaries"
PRELIMINARIES,0.029038112522686024,"Multi-label learning. We consider the standard multi-label learning setting. Let X be the input space
and Y = {+1,−1}l the set of all possible labels or tags, where l is a ﬁnite number. For example, X can
be a set of images, and Y can be a set of l pre-given tags (such as ’ﬂowers’, ’shoes’, or ’books’) that
can be associated with each image in the image tagging problem. Let n = ∣Y∣. For any instance x ∈X
and its associated label y = (y1,...,yl) ∈Y, if yi = +1, we say that label i is relevant to x. Otherwise,
it is not relevant. Let [l] = {1,...,l}. Given a sample S drawn i.i.d. according to some distribution
D over X × Y, the goal of multi-label learning is to learn a hypothesis h∶X × [l] →R to minimize the
generalization error deﬁned by a multi-label loss function L∶Hall × X × Y →R,
RL(h) =
E
(x,y)∼D[L(h,x,y)],
(1)"
PRELIMINARIES,0.030852994555353903,"where Hall is the family of all measurable hypotheses. For convenience, we abusively denote the
scoring vector by h(x) = (h(x,1),...,h(x,l)). Given a hypothesis set H ⊂Hall, we denote by
R∗
L(H) = infh∈H R(h) the best-in-class error. We refer to the difference RL(h) −R∗
L(H) as the
estimation error, which is termed the excess error when H = Hall. Let sign∶t ↦1t≥0 −1t<0 be the
sign function, and let t∶X →R+ be a threshold function. The target loss function L can be typically
given by a function L mapping from Y × Y to real numbers:
L(h,x,y) = L(h(x),y),
(2)
where h(x) ∶= [h1(x),...,hl(x)] ∈Y is the prediction for the input x ∈X and hi(x) = sign(h(x,i))
for any i ∈[l]. There are many multi-label loss functions, such as Hamming loss, (partial) ranking
loss, F1 and the more general Fβ measure loss, subset 0/1 loss, precision@κ, recall@κ, etc. [Zhang
and Zhou, 2013]. Among these, several loss functions are deﬁned based on the prediction of the
hypothesis h(x), while others are based on the scoring vector h(x). We will speciﬁcally consider the
ﬁrst type of multi-label loss in the form given in (2), which is based on some ‘distance’ between the
prediction and the true label. This includes all the loss functions previously mentioned (see Section 5
for a list of several common multi-label losses in this family) but excludes the (partial) ranking loss,
which is deﬁned based on pairwise scores. For convenience, we may alternatively refer to L or its
induced L as the multi-label loss. Without loss of generality, we assume that L ∈[0,1], which can
be achieved through normalization. We also denote by Lmax = maxy′,y L(y′,y). Our analysis is
general and adapts to any multi-label loss L. Note that we adhere to the decision-theoretic analysis
(DTA) framework, in which a loss function is deﬁned over a single instance, and the measure is
the expected loss, also known as the generalization error (the expectation of the loss function over
samples). Another popular framework is empirical utility maximization (EUM), where measures are
deﬁned directly as functions of the population, that is, as a function of the expectation over samples."
PRELIMINARIES,0.032667876588021776,"Surrogate risk minimization and consistency. Minimizing the multi-label loss L directly is com-
putationally hard for most hypothesis sets because it is discrete and non-convex. A common method
involves minimizing a smooth surrogate loss function ̃L∶Hall × X × Y →R, which is the main focus
of this paper. Minimizing a surrogate loss directly leads to an algorithm for multi-label learning.
A desirable guarantee for the surrogate loss in multi-label learning is Bayes-consistency [Zhang,
2004a,b, Bartlett et al., 2006, Tewari and Bartlett, 2007, Steinwart, 2007, Gao and Zhou, 2011]. That
is, minimizing the surrogate loss over the family of all measurable functions leads to the minimization
of the multi-label loss over the same family:

is an asymptotic guarantee that cannot provide any guarantee for approximate minimizers; it also
applies only to the family of all measurable functions and does not consider the hypothesis sets
typically used in practice. Instead, they propose a stronger guarantee known as H-consistency bounds,
which are both non-asymptotic and dependent on the hypothesis set, and imply Bayes-consistency
when H = Hall. These guarantees provide upper bounds on the target estimation error in terms of the
surrogate estimation error. In the multi-label learning scenario, they can be formulated as follows:"

loss function ̃Lbr clearly fails to account for the inherent correlations among labels. For instance,
‘coffee’ and ’mug’ are more likely to co-occur than ‘coffee’ and ‘umbrella’. Additionally, ̃Lbr is only
Bayes-consistent with respect to the Hamming loss and cannot yield risk-minimizing predictions for
other multi-label losses such as subset 0/1 loss or Fβ-measure loss [Dembczy´nski et al., 2012]. To

two single-source shortest-distance algorithms over the (+,×) semiring on an appropriate weighted

are (l + 1) vertices labeled 0,...,l. There are two transitions from k to (k + 1) labeled with +1 and
−1. The weight of the transition with label +1 is exp(+w ⋅̃Ψ(xj,k)), and exp(−w ⋅̃Ψ(xj,k)) for

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.3157894736842105,"We presented a comprehensive analysis of surrogate losses for multi-label learning, establishing
strong consistency guarantees. We introduced a novel multi-label logistic loss that addresses the
shortcomings of existing methods and enjoys label-independent consistency bounds. Our proposed
family of multi-label comp-sum losses offers a uniﬁed framework with strong consistency guarantees
for any general multi-label loss, signiﬁcantly expanding upon previous work. Additionally, we
presented efﬁcient algorithms for their gradient computation. While empirical validation is left for
future work, our theoretical results demonstrate the potential of these new surrogate losses to advance
multi-label learning. This uniﬁed framework shows promise for broader applications and paves the
way for future research in multi-label learning and related areas."

LIMITATIONS,0.9001814882032668,Justiﬁcation: See Appendix C.
LIMITATIONS,0.9019963702359347,Guidelines:
LIMITATIONS,0.9038112522686026,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-speciﬁcation, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reﬂect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reﬂect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reﬂect on the factors that inﬂuence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be speciﬁcally instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations."

perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions

Answer: [NA]
Justiﬁcation: The paper does not include experiments.
Guidelines:"
THEORY ASSUMPTIONS AND PROOFS,0.9165154264972777,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or veriﬁable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might sufﬁce, or if the contribution is a speciﬁc model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

of the mean."
THEORY ASSUMPTIONS AND PROOFS,0.9310344827586207,"• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not veriﬁed.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
ﬁgures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding ﬁgures or tables in the text."

BROADER IMPACTS,0.9546279491833031,10. Broader Impacts
BROADER IMPACTS,0.956442831215971,"Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?"
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9582577132486388,Answer: [NA]
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9600725952813067,"Justiﬁcation: Our work is theoretical in nature and we do not anticipate any immediate
negative societal impact."
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9618874773139746,Guidelines:
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9637023593466425,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake proﬁles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact speciﬁc
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations."
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9655172413793104,"• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efﬁciency and accessibility of ML)."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9673321234119783,11. Safeguards
SAFEGUARDS,0.969147005444646,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?"
SAFEGUARDS,0.9709618874773139,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.9727767695099818,Justiﬁcation: The paper poses no such risks.
SAFEGUARDS,0.9745916515426497,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9764065335753176,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety ﬁlters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
