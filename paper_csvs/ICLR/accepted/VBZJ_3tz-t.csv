ABSTRACT,0.0021321961620469083,"Random pruning is arguably the most naive way to attain sparsity in neural net-
works, but has been deemed uncompetitive by either post-training pruning or
sparse training. In this paper, we focus on sparse training and highlight a per-
haps counter-intuitive ﬁnding, that random pruning at initialization can be quite
powerful for the sparse training of modern neural networks. Without any delicate
pruning criteria or carefully pursued sparsity structures, we empirically demon-
strate that sparsely training a randomly pruned network from scratch can match
the performance of its dense equivalent. There are two key factors that con-
tribute to this revival: (i) the network sizes matter: as the original dense networks
grow wider and deeper, the performance of training a randomly pruned sparse
network will quickly grow to matching that of its dense equivalent, even at high
sparsity ratios; (ii) appropriate layer-wise sparsity ratios can be pre-chosen for
sparse training, which shows to be another important performance booster. Simple
as it looks, a randomly pruned subnetwork of Wide ResNet-50 can be sparsely
trained to outperforming a dense Wide ResNet-50, on ImageNet. We also ob-
served such randomly pruned networks outperform dense counterparts in other
favorable aspects, such as out-of-distribution detection, uncertainty estimation, and
adversarial robustness. Overall, our results strongly suggest there is larger-than-
expected room for sparse training at scale, and the beneﬁts of sparsity might be
more universal beyond carefully designed pruning. Our source code can be found

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.006396588486140725,"Most recent breakthroughs in deep learning are fairly achieved with the increased complexity of
over-parameterized networks (Brown et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Fedus
et al., 2021. arXiv:2101.03961; Jumper et al., 2021; Berner et al., 2019). It is well-known that large
models train better (Neyshabur et al., 2019; Novak et al., 2018; Allen-Zhu et al., 2019), generalize
better (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019; Xie & Yuille, 2020; Zhao et al., 2018), and transfer better (Chen
et al., 2020b;a; 2021b). However, the upsurge of large models exacerbates the gap between research
and practice since many real-life applications demand compact and efﬁcient networks."
INTRODUCTION,0.008528784648187633,"Neural network pruning, since proposed by (Mozer & Smolensky, 1989; Janowsky, 1989), has evolved
as the most common technique in literature to reduce the computational and memory requirements of
neural networks. Over the past few years, numerous pruning criteria have been proposed, including
magnitude (Mozer & Smolensky, 1989; Han et al., 2015; Frankle & Carbin, 2019; Mocanu et al.,
2018), Hessian (LeCun et al., 1990; Hassibi & Stork, 1993), mutual information (Dai et al., 2018),
Taylor expansion (Molchanov et al., 2016), movement (Sanh et al., 2020), connection sensitivity (Lee
et al., 2019), etc. Motivated for different scenarios, pruning can occur after training (Han et al., 2015;
Frankle & Carbin, 2019; Molchanov et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2021), during training (Zhu & Gupta,"

INTRODUCTION,0.01279317697228145,"2017; Gale et al., 2019; Louizos et al., 2018; You et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021c;a), and even before
training (Mocanu et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Gale et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Tanaka et al.,
2020). The last regime can be further categorized into “static sparse training” (Mocanu et al., 2016;
Gale et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020) and “dynamic sparse training” (Mocanu et al.,
2018; Bellec et al., 2018; Evci et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2021b;a)."
INTRODUCTION,0.014925373134328358,"While random pruning is a universal method that can happen at any stage of training, training a
randomly pruned network from scratch is arguably the most appealing way, owing to its “end-to-end”
saving potential for the entire training process besides the inference. Due to this reason, we focus
on random pruning for sparse training in this paper. When new pruning approaches bloom, random
pruning naturally becomes their performance’s empirical “lower bound” since the connections are
randomly chosen without any good reasoning. Likely due to the same reason, the results of sparse
training with random pruning (as “easy to beat” baselines to support fancier new pruning methods)
reported in the literature are unfortunately vague, often inconsistent, and sometimes casual. For
instance, it is found in Liu et al. (2020b) that randomly pruned sparse networks can be trained from
scratch to match the full accuracy of dense networks with only 20% parameters, whereas around 80%
parameters are required to do so in Frankle et al. (2021). The differences may arise from architecture
choices, training recipes, distribution hyperparameters/layer-wise ratios, and so on."
INTRODUCTION,0.017057569296375266,"In most pruning literature (Gale et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019; Frankle et al., 2021; Tanaka et al.,
2020), random pruning usually refers to randomly removing the same proportion of parameters
per layer, ending up with uniform layer-wise sparsities. Nevertheless, researchers have explored
other pre-deﬁned layer-wise sparsities, e.g., uniform+ (Gale et al., 2019), Erd˝os-R´enyi random
graph (ER) (Mocanu et al., 2018), and Erd˝os-R´enyi-Kernel (ERK) (Evci et al., 2020a). These layer-
wise sparsities also ﬁt the category of random pruning, as they require no training to obtain the
corresponding sparsity ratios. We assess random pruning for sparse training with these layer-wise
sparsity ratios, in terms of various perspectives besides the predictive accuracy."
INTRODUCTION,0.019189765458422176,Our main ﬁndings during this course of study are summarized below:
INTRODUCTION,0.021321961620469083,"• We ﬁnd that the network size matters for the effectiveness of sparse training with random
pruning. With small networks, random pruning hardly matches the full accuracy even at mild
sparsities (10%, 20%). However, as the networks grow wider and deeper, the performance
of training a randomly pruned sparse network will quickly grow to matching that of its dense
equivalent, even at high sparsity ratios."
INTRODUCTION,0.023454157782515993,"• We further identify that appropriate layer-wise sparsity ratios can be an important booster
for training a randomly pruned network from scratch, particularly for large networks. We
investigate several options to pre-deﬁne layer-wise sparsity ratios before any training; one
of them is able to push the performance of a completely random sparse Wide ResNet-50
over the densely trained Wide ResNet-50 on ImageNet."
INTRODUCTION,0.0255863539445629,"• We systematically assess the performance of sparse training with random pruning, and
observe surprisingly good accuracy and robustness. The accuracy achieved by ERK ratio
can even surpass the ones learned by complex criteria, e.g., SNIP or GraSP. In addition,
randomly pruned and sparsely trained networks are found to outperform conventional dense
networks in other favorable aspects, such as out-of-distribution (OoD) detection, adversarial
robustness, and uncertainty estimation."

STATIC SPARSE TRAINING,0.04051172707889126,"Non-Random Pruning. Instead of pre-choosing a sparsity ratio for each layer, many works utilize
the proposed saliency criteria to learn the layer-wise sparsity ratios before training, also termed
as pruning at initialization (PaI). Lee et al. (2019) ﬁrst introduced SNIP that chooses structurally
important connections at initialization via the proposed connection sensitivity. Following SNIP,
many efﬁcient criteria have been proposed to improve the performance of non-random pruning
at initialization, including but not limited to gradient ﬂow (GraSP; Wang et al. (2020)), synaptic
strengths (SynFlow; Tanaka et al. (2020)), neural tangent kernel (Liu & Zenke, 2020), and iterative
SNIP (de Jorge et al., 2021; Verdenius et al., 2020). Su et al. (2020); Frankle et al. (2021) uncovered
that the existing PaI methods hardly exploit any information from the training data and are very
robust to mask shufﬂing, whereas magnitude pruning after training learns both, reﬂecting a broader
challenge inherent to pruning at initialization."

DYNAMIC SPARSE TRAINING"
DYNAMIC SPARSE TRAINING,0.04477611940298507,"In contrast to static sparse training, dynamic sparse training stems from randomly initialized sparse
subnetworks, and meanwhile dynamically explores new sparse connectivity during training. Dynamic
sparse training starts from Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET) (Mocanu et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020a)
which initializes the sparse connectivity with Erd˝os-R´enyi (Erd˝os & R´enyi, 1959) topology and peri-
odically explores the sparse connectivity via a prune-and-grow scheme during the course of training.
While there exist numerous pruning criteria in the literature, simple magnitude pruning typically
performs well in the ﬁeld of dynamic sparse training. On the other hand, the criteria used to grow
weights back differs from method to method, including randomness (Mocanu et al., 2018; Mostafa &
Wang, 2019), momentum (Dettmers & Zettlemoyer, 2019), gradient (Evci et al., 2020a; Jayakumar
et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021b). Besides the prune-and-grow scheme, layer-wise sparsities are vital
to achieving high accuracy. (Mostafa & Wang, 2019; Dettmers & Zettlemoyer, 2019) reallocates
weights across layers during training based on reasonable heuristics, demonstrating performance
improvement. Evci et al. (2020a) extended ER to CNNs and showed considerable performance
gains to sparse CNN training with the Erd˝os-R´enyi-Kernel (ERK) ratio. Very recently, Liu et al.
(2021a) started from a subnetwork at a smaller sparsity and gradually pruned it the target sparsity
during training. The denser initial subnetwork provides a larger exploration space for DST at the
early training phase and thus leads to a performance improvement, especially for extreme sparsities.
Even though dynamic sparse training achieves promising sparse training performance, it changes the
sparse connectivity during training and is thus out of the scope of random pruning."
DYNAMIC SPARSE TRAINING,0.046908315565031986,"While prior works have observed that random pruning can be more competitive in certain cases (Mo-
canu et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020b; Su et al., 2020; Frankle et al., 2021), they did not give principled
guidelines on when and how it can become that good; nor do they show it can match the performance
of dense networks on ImageNet. Standing on the shoulders of those giants, our work summarized
principles by more extensive and rigorous studies, and demonstrate the strongest result so far, that
randomly pruned sparse Wide ResNet-50 can be sparsely trained to outperform a dense Wide ResNet-
50, on ImageNet. Moreover, compared with the ad-hoc sparsity ratios used in (Su et al., 2020), we
show that ERK (Evci et al., 2020a) and our modiﬁed ERK+ are more generally applicable sparsity
ratios that consistently demonstrate competitive performance without careful layer-wise sparsity
design for every architecture. Speciﬁcally, ERK+ ratio achieves similar accuracy with the dense Wide
ResNet-50 on ImageNet while being data free, feedforward free, and dense initialization free."

lowest scores in one iteration are pruned before training. While not initially designed for random
pruning, we adjust SNIP for random pruning by only keeping its layer-wise sparsity ratios, while
discarding its mask positions. New mask positions (non-zero elements) are re-sampled through a
uniform distribution ∼Uniform(0, 1) with a probability of 1 −sl. Such layer-wise sparsities are
obtained in a (slightly) data-driven way, yet very efﬁciently before training without any weight update.

To avoid overlapping of multiple curves, we share the results of GraSP in Appendix C. The main
observations are as follows:"
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON CIFAR,0.18763326226012794,"1 Performance of random pruning improves with the size of the network. We vary the depth
and width of ResNet and report the test accuracy in Figure 1. When operating on small networks,
e.g., ResNet-20 and ResNet-32, we can hardly ﬁnd matching subnetworks even at mild sparsities, i.e.,
10%, 20%. With larger networks, e.g., ResNet-56 and ResNet-110, random pruning can match the
dense performance at 60% ∼70% sparsity. Similar behavior can also be observed when we increase
the width of ResNet-20 in Figure 2. See Appendix B for results on deeper models."
THE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT PRUNING METHODS BECOMES INDISTINCT AS THE,0.18976545842217485,"2 The performance difference between different pruning methods becomes indistinct as the
model size increases. Even though uniform sparsities fail to match the accuracy achieved by non-
uniform sparsities (ERK and SNIP) with small models, their test accuracy raises to a comparable
level as non-uniform sparsities with large models, e.g., ResNet-110 and ResNet-20-56."
THE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT PRUNING METHODS BECOMES INDISTINCT AS THE,0.19189765458422176,"3 Random pruning with ERK even outperforms pruning with the well-versed methods (SNIP,
GraSP). Without using any information, e.g., gradient and magnitude, training a randomly pruned
subnetwork with ERK topology leads to expressive accuracy, even better than the ones trained with
the delicately designed sparsity ratios, i.e., SNIP, and GraSP (shown in Appendix C)."

THE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT PRUNING METHODS BECOMES INDISTINCT AS THE,0.19616204690831557,"In general, sparse training with random pruning achieves quite strong results on CIFAR-10 in terms
of uncertainty estimation, OoD robustness, and adversarial robustness without any fancy techniques.
We summary main observations as below:"
RANDOMLY PRUNED NETWORKS ENJOY BETTER UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION THAN THEIR DENSE COUNTER-,0.19829424307036247,"1 Randomly pruned networks enjoy better uncertainty estimation than their dense counter-
parts. Figure 3 shows that randomly pruned ResNet-20 matches or even improves the uncertainty
estimation of dense networks with a full range of sparsities. ECE of random pruning grows with the
model size, in line with the ﬁnding of dense networks in Guo et al. (2017). Still, random pruning
is capable of sampling matching subnetworks with high sparsities (e.g., 80%) except for the largest
model, ResNet-110. Results of NLL are presented in Appendix G.2, where randomly pruned networks
also match NLL of dense networks at extremely high sparsities."
RANDOMLY PRUNED NETWORKS ENJOY BETTER UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION THAN THEIR DENSE COUNTER-,0.20042643923240938,"2 Random pruning produces extremely sparse yet robust subnetworks on OoD. Figure 4 plots
the results of networks trained on CIFAR-10, tested on CIFAR-100. The results tested on SVHN
are reported in Appendix G.1. Large network sizes signiﬁcantly improve the OoD performance of
random pruning. As the model size increases, random pruning can match the OoD performance of
dense networks with only 20% parameters. Again, SNIP ratio and ERK outperform uniform sparsities
in this setting."
RANDOMLY PRUNED NETWORKS ENJOY BETTER UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION THAN THEIR DENSE COUNTER-,0.2025586353944563,"3 Random pruning improves the adversarial robustness of large models. The adversarial
robustness of large models (e.g., ResNet-56 and ResNet-110) improves signiﬁcantly with mild
sparsities in Appendix G.3. One explanation here is that, while achieving high clean accuracy,
these over-parameterized large models are highly overﬁtted on CIFAR-10, and thus suffer from poor
performance on adversarial examples (shown by Tsipras et al. (2019); Zhang et al. (2019) as well).
Sparsity induced by random pruning serves as a cheap type of regularization which possibly mitigates
this overﬁtting problem."

beneﬁts do the layer-wise sparsities of SNIP provide to sparse training? Since SNIP takes gradients
into account when determines the layer-wise sparsities, we turn to gradient ﬂow in the hope of
ﬁnding some insights on this question. The form of gradient norm we choose is the effective gradient
ﬂow (Tessera et al., 2021) which only calculates the gradient norm of active weights. We measure the

phase after gradient norm drops) could better understand the behaviour of networks trained under
different scenarios. We empirically ﬁnd that ﬁnal performance gaps between sparse networks and
dense networks is highly correlated with gaps of gradient norm early in training. Training with
small networks (e.g., ResNet-20) on CIFAR-10 results in large performance and gradient norm gaps
between sparse networks and dense networks, whereas these two gaps simultaneously vanish when
trained with large networks, e.g., ResNet-56 and ResNet-110. Similar behavior can be observed in
Wide ResNet-50 on ImageNet in terms of sparsity. Both the performance and gradient norm gaps
decrease gradually as the sparsity level drops from 85% to 60%. This actually makes sense, since
large networks (either large model size or large number of parameters) are likely to still be over-
parameterized after pruning, so that all pruning methods (including random pruning) can preserve
gradient ﬂow along with test accuracy equally well."

CONCLUSION,0.4072494669509595,"In this work, we systematically revisit the underrated baseline of sparse training – random pruning.
Our results highlight a counter-intuitive ﬁnding, that is, training a randomly pruned network from
scratch without any delicate pruning criteria can be quite performant. With proper network sizes and
layer-wise sparsity ratios, random pruning can match the performance of dense networks even at
extreme sparsities. Impressively, a randomly pruned subnetwork of Wide ResNet-50 can be trained
to outperforming a strong benchmark, dense Wide ResNet-50 on ImageNet. Moreover, training with
random pruning intrinsically brings signiﬁcant beneﬁts to other desirable aspects, such as out-of-
distribution detection, uncertainty estimation and adversarial robustness. Our paper indicates that in
addition to appealing performance, large models also enjoy strong robustness to pruning. Even if we
pruning with complete randomness, large models can preserve their performance well."

REFERENCES,0.6140724946695096,"Formally, let’s denote a (sparse) network f : X →Y trained on samples from distribution D. f(x, θ)
and f(x, θ ⊙m) refers to the dense network and the pruned network, respectively. The test accuracy
of the pruned subnetworks is typically reported as their accuracy on test queries drawn from D, i.e.,
P(x,y)∼D(f(x, θ ⊙m) = y). In addition to the test accuracy, we also evaluate random pruning from
the perspective of adversarial robustness (Goodfellow et al., 2014), OoD performance (Hendrycks
et al., 2021), and uncertainty estimation (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2016)."
REFERENCES,0.6162046908315565,"Adversarial Robustness. Despite of the remarkable ability solving classiﬁcation problems, the
predictions of deep neural networks can often be fooled by small adversarial perturbations (Szegedy
et al., 2013; Papernot et al., 2016). Prior works have shown the possibility of ﬁnding the sweet point
of sparsity and adversarial robustness (Guo et al., 2018; Ye et al., 2019; Gui et al., 2019; Hu et al.,
2020). As the arguably most naive method of inducing sparsity, we are also interested in if training a
randomly pruned subnetwork can improve the adversarial robustness of deep networks. We follow
the classical method proposed in Goodfellow et al. (2014) and generate adversarial examples with
Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). Speciﬁcally, input data is perturbed with ϵsign(∇xL(θ, x, y)),
where ϵ refers to the perturbation strength, which is chosen as

evaluate whether random pruning brings beneﬁts to OoD. Following the classic routines (Augustin

REFERENCES,0.8763326226012793,"ERK+. We demonstrate the performance improvement caused by ERK+ on ImageNet. As mentioned
earlier, ERK naturally allocates higher sparsities to the larger layers while allocating lower sparsities
to the smaller ones. As a consequence, the last fully-connected layer is very likely to be dense for the
datasets with only a few classes, e.g., CIFAR-10. However, for the datasets with a larger number of
classes, e.g., ImageNet, the fully-connected layer is usually sparse. We empirically ﬁnd that allocating
more parameters to the last fully-connected layer while keeping the overall parameter count ﬁxed
leads to higher accuracy for ERK with Wide ResNet-50 on ImageNet."

test accuracy achieved by the corresponding sparse Wide ResNet-50 on ImageNet in Figure 14-left.
We can observe that the test accuracy consistently increases as the last layer’s sparsity decreases from
0.8 to 0. Consequently, we keep the last fully-connected layer of ERK dense for ImageNet and term
this modiﬁed variant as ERK+."
REFERENCES,0.8805970149253731,"Compare random pruning with its dense equivalents. To draw a more solid conclusion, we train
large, randomly pruned Wide ResNet-50 on ImageNet and compare it to the dense equivalents with
the same number of parameters on ImageNet. As shown in Figure14-right, all randomly pruned
networks outperform the dense ResNet-34 with the same number of parameters. ERK+ consistently
achieves higher accuracy than ERK, even closely approaching the strong baseline – dense ResNet-50.
More interestingly, the layer-wise sparsities discovered by SNIP boost the accuracy of sparse Wide
ResNet-50 over dense ResNet-50, highlighting the importance of layer-wise sparsity ratios on sparse
training . Given the fact that the performance gap between SNIP ratio and ERK on CIFAR-10 is
somehow vague, our results highlight the necessity of evaluating any proposed pruning methods with
large-scale models and datasets, e.g., ResNet-50 on ImageNet."
