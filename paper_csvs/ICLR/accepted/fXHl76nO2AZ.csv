ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.002680965147453083,"Though recent works have developed methods that can generate estimates (or im-
putations) of the missing entries in a dataset to facilitate downstream analysis, most
depend on assumptions that may not align with real-world applications and could
suffer from poor performance in subsequent tasks such as classiﬁcation. This is par-
ticularly true if the data have large missingness rates or a small sample size. More
importantly, the imputation error could be propagated into the prediction step that
follows, which may constrain the capabilities of the prediction model. In this work,
we introduce the gradient importance learning (GIL) method to train multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) and long short-term memories (LSTMs) to directly perform
inference from inputs containing missing values without imputation. Speciﬁcally,
we employ reinforcement learning (RL) to adjust the gradients used to train these
models via back-propagation. This allows the model to exploit the underlying infor-
mation behind missingness patterns. We test the approach on real-world time-series
(i.e., MIMIC-III), tabular data obtained from an eye clinic, and a standard dataset
(i.e., MNIST), where our imputation-free predictions outperform the traditional
two-step imputation-based predictions using state-of-the-art imputation methods."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.00804289544235925,"We consider learning from incomplete datasets. Components of the data could be missing for various
reasons, for instance, missing responses from participants, data loss, and restricted access issues. This
phenomenon is prevalent in the healthcare domain, mostly in the context of electronic health records
(EHRs), which are structured as patient-speciﬁc irregular timelines with attributes, e.g., diagnosis,
laboratory tests, vitals, thus resulting in high missingness across patients for any arbitrary time
point. Such missingness introduces difﬁculties when developing models and performing inference in
real-world applications such as Kam & Kim (2017); Scherpf et al. (2019). Existing works tackle
this problem by either proposing imputation algorithms (IAs) to explicitly produce estimates of the
missing data, or by imposing imputation objectives during inference, e.g., withholding observed
values as being the ground-truth and learning to impute them. However, some of these either require
additional modeling assumptions for the underlying distributions (Bashir & Wei, 2018; Fortuin et al.,
2020), or formatting of the data (Yu et al., 2016; Schnabel et al., 2016). Other applications depend on
domain knowledge for pre-processing and modeling such as Yang et al. (2018); Kam & Kim (2017),
or introduce additional information-based losses (Cao et al., 2018; Lipton et al., 2016), which are
usually intractable with real-world data. Moreover, generative methods (Mattei & Frellsen, 2019;
Yoon et al., 2018) could result in imputations with high variation (e.g., low conﬁdence of the output
distribution), when data have high missingness rates or small sample sizes. Figure 1 illustrates
imputations generated by two state-of-the-art deep generative models on the MNIST dataset with
50%, 70% and 90% of the pixels set as missing (i.e., masked out). It is observed that both approaches
suffer from inaccurate reconstruction of the original digits as the missingness rate increases, which
is manifested as some of the imputed images not being recognizable as digits. Importantly, the
error introduced by the imputation process can be further propagated into downstream inference and
prediction stages."

INTRODUCTION,0.01876675603217158,"Consider a scenario in which two patients, A and B, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) suffer
from bacterial and viral infections, respectively, and assume that the healthcare provider monitors the
status of the patients by ordering two (slightly) different blood tests periodically, namely, a culture
test/panel speciﬁc to bacterial infections and a RT-PCR test/panel speciﬁc to viral infections. Hence,
patient A is likely to have much fewer orders (and results) for viral tests. In both cases, the missingness
patterns are indicative of the underlying condition of both patients. Moreover, such patterns are
more commonly found in incomplete data caused by missing at random (MAR) or missing not at
random (MNAR) mechanisms, which usually introduce additional difﬁculties for inference (Little &
Rubin, 2019). Inspired by this, we propose the gradient importance learning (GIL) method, which
facilitates an imputation-free learning framework for incomplete data by simultaneously leveraging
the observed data and the information underlying missingness patterns."

INTRODUCTION,0.024128686327077747,"Speciﬁcally, we propose to use an importance
matrix to weight the gradients that are used
to update the model parameters in the back-
propagation process, after the computational
graph of the model is settled, which allows
the model to exploit the information underly-
ing missingness without imputation. However,
these gradients cannot be tracked by automated
differentiation tools such as Tensorﬂow (Abadi
et al., 2016). So motivated, we propose to gener-
ate the importance matrix using a reinforcement
learning (RL) policy on-the-ﬂy. This is done by
conditioning on the status of training procedure
characterized by the model parameters, inputs and model performance at the current training step.
Concurrently, RL algorithms are used to update the policy by ﬁrst modeling the back-propagation
process as an RL environment, or a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, by interacting with the
environment, the RL algorithm can learn the optimal policy so the importance matrix can aid the
training of the prediction models to attain desirable performance. Moreover, we also show that our
framework can be augmented with feature learning techniques, e.g., contrastive learning as in Chen
et al. (2020), which can further improve the performance of the proposed imputation-free models."
INTRODUCTION,0.02680965147453083,"The technical contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: (i) to the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work that trains deep learning (DL) models to perform accurate imputation-
free predictions with missing inputs. This allows models to effectively handle high missing rates, while
signiﬁcantly reducing the prediction error compared to existing imputation-prediction frameworks.
(ii) Unlike existing approaches that require additional modeling assumptions or that rely on methods
(or pre-existing knowledge) that intrinsically have advantages over speciﬁc types of data, our method
does not require any assumptions or domain expertise. Consequently, it can consistently achieve top
performance over a variety of data and under different conditions. (iii) The proposed framework
also facilitates feature learning from incomplete data, as the importance matrix can guide the hidden
layers of the model to capture information underlying missingness patterns during training, which
results in more expressive features, as illustrated in Figure 3."

GRADIENT IMPORTANCE
Missingness is a common issue found in tabular data and time series, where multi-layered perceptron
(MLP) (Bishop, 2006) and long short-term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)
models, respectively, are often considered for predictions. Below we illustrate how the importance
matrix can be applied to gradients, which are produced by taking regular stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) steps, toward training MLP models with incomplete tabular inputs. Note that this idea can
be easily extended to sequential inputs with LSTM models and the corresponding details can be
found in Appendix A. First, the deﬁnitions of the dataset and missing indicators can be reduced
to Xtab = (x1, x2, . . . , xN) and Mtab = (m1, m2, . . . , mN), with xj ∈Rd and mj ∈Rd,
respectively. Then we deﬁne an MLP with k hidden layers, for k ≥2, as follows"

RL TO GENERATE IMPORTANCE MATRIX
Now we show how to use RL to generate the importance matrix A. In general, RL aims to learn an
optimal policy that maximizes expected rewards, by interacting with an unknown environment (Sutton
& Barto, 2018). Formally, the RL environment is characterized by a Markov decision process (MDP),
with details introduced below. Each time after the agent chooses an action a = π(s) at state s
following some policy π, the environment responds with the next state s′, along with an immediate
reward r = R(s, a) given a reward function R(·, ·). The goal is to learn an optimal policy that
maximizes the expected total reward deﬁned as J(π) = Eρπ[PT
i=0 γir(si, ai)] , where T is the
horizon of the MDP, γ ∈[0, 1) is the discounting factor, and ρπ = {(s0, a0), (s1, a1), . . . |ai =
π(si)} is the sequence of states and actions drawn from the trajectory distribution determined by π."

"EXTENSIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK
THE PROPOSED GIL FRAMEWORK USES RL AGENTS TO GUIDE THE MODEL TOWARD MINIMIZING ITS OBJECTIVE",0.1126005361930295,"2.4
EXTENSIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK
The proposed GIL framework uses RL agents to guide the model toward minimizing its objective
E(ˆy, y), which is usually captured by general prediction losses such as cross entropy or mean
squared error. Below we use an example to show how our method can be extended to adapt ideas
from related domains, which can augment training of the imputation-free prediction models by
altering the reward function. Recent works in contrastive learning, e.g., Chen et al. (2020), can train
DL models to generate highly expressive features by penalizing (or promoting) the distributional
difference D(ζ+, ζ−) among the features associated with inputs that are similar to (or different from)
each other, where ζ+ denotes the set of features corresponding to one set of homogeneous inputs
Xcon, and ζ−are the features generated by data that are signiﬁcantly different from the ones in Xcon.
However, such methods may not be directly applied to the missing data setting considered in this
work, as their loss D is usually designed toward unsupervised training and might need to be carefully
re-worked in our case. This idea can be adapted to our framework by deﬁning ζ+ as the features
mapped from the inputs (by the encoding layers Wenc) associated with the same label y ∈Y and ζ−
the features corresponding to some other label y′ ∈Y. Then we can deﬁne the new reward function
R(s, a) = −E(ˆy, y) + c · D(ζ+, ζ−), c > 0, which does not require D to be carefully crafted,
provided that Wenc is not trained by directly propagating gradients from it. In Section 4 it will be
shown in case studies that by simply deﬁning D as the mean squared error between ζ+ and ζ−can
improve the prediction performance."

underlying distribution, or fail to generalize well when used with datasets containing mixed types of
variables, i.e., when discrete and continuous values exist simultaneously (Yoon et al., 2018; Fortuin
et al., 2020). There also exist matrix-completion methods that usually assume the data are static,
i.e., information does not change over time, and often rely on low-rank assumptions (Wang et al.,
2006; Yu et al., 2016; Mazumder et al., 2010; Schnabel et al., 2016). More recently, several DL-based
IAs have been proposed following advancements in deep generative models such as deep latent
variable models (DLVMs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Mattei & Frellsen, 2019;
Yoon et al., 2018; Fortuin et al., 2020; Li et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2018). DLVMs are usually trained to
capture the underlying distribution of the data, by maximizing an evidence lower bound (ELBO),
which could introduce high variations to the output distributions (Kingma & Welling, 2013) and
cause poor performance in practice, if the data have high missingness (as for the example shown in
Figure 1). There also exist end-to-end methods that withhold observed values from inputs and impose
reconstruction losses during training of prediction models (Cao et al., 2018; Ipsen et al., 2020). In
addition, data-driven IAs are developed speciﬁcally toward medical time series by incorporating prior
domain knowledge (Yang et al., 2018; Scherpf et al., 2019; Calvert et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2021).
On the other hand, a few recent works attempt to address missing inputs through an imputation-free
manner (Morvan et al., 2020; Sportisse et al., 2020), however, they are limited to linear regression."
RELATED WORK,0.1260053619302949,"Attention.
The importance matrix used in the GIL is somewhat reminiscent of visual attention
mechanisms in the context of image captioning or multi-object recognition (Mnih et al., 2014;
Ba et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015) as they both require training of the prediction models with RL.
We brieﬂy discuss the connections and distinctions between them, with full details provided in
Appendix C. Visual attentions are commonly used to train CNNs to focus on speciﬁc portions of
the inputs that are most helpful for making predictions. They are determined by maximizing an
evidence lower bound (ELBO), which is later proved to be equivalent to the REINFORCE algorithm
in the RL literature (Sutton & Barto, 2018; Mnih et al., 2014). However, these methods cannot be
applied directly to our problem, as they require features to be exclusively associated spatially with
speciﬁc parts of the inputs, which is attainable by using convolutional encoders with image inputs
but intractable with the type of data considered in our work. Instead, our approach overcomes this
issue by directly applying importance weights, generated by RL, into the gradient space during
back-propagation. Such issues motivate use of the term importance instead of attention. Lastly, our
method does not require one to formulate the learning objective as an ELBO, and as a result GIL
can adopt any state-of-the-art RL algorithm, without being limited to REINFORCE as in Mnih et al.
(2014); Ba et al. (2014); Xu et al. (2015). Besides, other types of attention mechanisms are also
proposed toward applications in sequence modeling and natural language processing (NLP) such
as Cheng et al. (2016); Vaswani et al. (2017)."

EXPERIMENTS,0.13136729222520108,"We evaluate the performance of the imputation-free prediction models trained by GIL against the
existing imputation-prediction paradigm on both benchmark and real-world datasets, where the
imputation stage employs both state-of-the-art and classic imputation algorithms (IAs), with the
details introduced in Section 4.1. We also consider variations of the GIL method proposed in Section 2
to illustrate its robustness and ﬂexibility. The datasets we use include i) MIMIC-III (Johnson et al.,
2016) that consists of real-world EHRs obtained from intensive care units (ICUs), ii) a de-identiﬁed
ophthalmic patient dataset obtained from an eye center in North America, and iii) hand-written digits
MNIST (LeCun & Cortes). We also tested on a smaller scaled ICU time-series from 2012 Physionet
challenge (Silva et al., 2012) and these results can be found in Appendix D.4. Some of the data are
augmented with additional missingness to ensure sufﬁcient missing rates and the datasets we use
cover all types of missing data, i.e., missing complete at random (MCAR), MAR and MNAR (Little
& Rubin, 2019). We found that the proposed method not only outperforms the baselines on all three
datasets under various experimental settings, but also offers better feature representations as shown in
Figure 3. We start with an overview of the baseline methods, in the following sub-section, and then
proceed to present our experimental ﬁndings."

VARIANTS OF GIL AND BASELINES,0.15281501340482573,"For other baselines, following the imputation-prediction framework, the imputation stage employs
state-of-the-art IAs including MIWAE (Mattei & Frellsen, 2019) which imputes the missing data
by training variational auto-encoders (VAEs) to maximize an ELBO, GP-VAE (Fortuin et al., 2020)
that couples VAEs with Gaussian processes (GPs) to consider the temporal correlation in time-series,
and the generative adversarial network-based method GAIN (Yoon et al., 2018). Further, some
classical imputation methods are also considered, including MICE, missForest (MF), k-nearest
neighbor (kNN), expectation-maximization (EM), mean-imputation (Mean), zero-imputation (Zero)
and carrying-forward (CF). The imputed data from these baselines are fed into the prediction models
that share the same architecture as the ones trained by GIL, for fair comparison. For time-series, we
also compare to BRITS (Cao et al., 2018) which trains bidirectional LSTMs end-to-end by masking
out additional observed data and jointly imposing imputation and classiﬁcation objectives."

MIMIC-III
We consider the early prediction of septic shock using the MIMIC-III dataset, following the frame-
works provided in recent data-driven works for data pre-processing (Sheetrit et al., 2017; Fleuren
et al., 2020; Khoshnevisan et al., 2020). Speciﬁcally, we use 14 commonly-utilized vital signs and
lab results over a 2-hour observation window to predict whether a patient will develop septic shock in
the next 4-hour window. The resulting dataset used for training and testing contains 2,166 sequences
each of which has length between 3 and 125, and the overall missing rate is 71.63%; the missing
data in this dataset can be considered as a mixture of MCAR, MAR and MNAR. More details can be
found in Appendix D.1."
MIMIC-III,0.1581769436997319,"To evaluate performance, we consider the prediction model constituted by a 1024-unit LSTM layer
for encoding followed by a dense output layer for inference. Considering that some of the baseline
methods are not designed to capture the temporal correlations within the sequences which do not
follow a ﬁxed horizon, besides testing with the varied-length sequences (Var-l.) obtained in above,
we also test with a ﬁxed-length version (Fix-l.) where the maximum time step for each sequence is
set to be 8 (see Appendix D.1 for details). The accuracy1 and AUC for the two tests are summarized
in Table 1. When varied-length sequences are considered, GIL(-D) slightly outperforms GAIN
and MICE while it signiﬁcantly dominates the other baseline methods. However, when ﬁxed-
length sequences are considered, GAIN and MICE’s performance decreases dramatically and are
signiﬁcantly dominated by that of GIL(-D). This could be caused by omitting the records beyond
the 8-th time step as both models are ﬂexible enough to capture such information from that point on-
wards, while in contrast, the performance increases for kNN, MF and EM which are in general based
on much simpler models. On the other hand, the models trained by GIL(-D) was not signiﬁcantly
affected by the information loss. In fact, it emphasizes that applying importance to the gradients
during training can enable the model to capture the information behind missing data. Moreover, the
dramatically increased performance from GIL-H to GIL(-D) in both tests underscores the signiﬁcance
of training the models using the importance determined by the RL policy learned by GIL(-D), instead
of a pre-deﬁned heuristic. Note that according to a recent survey of septic shock predictions (Fleuren
et al., 2020), the overall maximum AUC attained by existing data-driven methods, which uses domain
knowledge to design models speciﬁcally for ICU time-series, is 0.96 and it is comparable to that
attained by our method. Finally, GP-VAE and BRITS require the input sequences to have the same
horizon, so we only report for the Fix-l. case where they under-perform. These are possibly due to"

OPHTHALMIC DATA
We consider identifying diabetic retinopathy (DR), an eye disease caused by diabetes, using the
de-identiﬁed data obtained from Duke Eye Center, constituted by a mixture of image feature vectors
and tabular information. Speciﬁcally, the data collected from each subject is formulated as a
vector with 4,101 dimensions containing two 2,048-length feature vectors from two retinal imaging
modalities, optic coherence tomography (OCT) and color fundus photography (CFP), followed by a
5-dimensional data characterizing demographic (e.g., age) and diabetic information (e.g., years of
diabetes). Additional details of the dataset and examples of the OCT and CFP images are provided
in the Appendix D.2. At most one of the two types of retinal images could be missing due to
MAR as sometimes the diagnosis can be performed with a single modality (Cui et al., 2021), while
the demographic/diabetic information can be missing due to MCAR. A total of 1,148 subjects are
included in this dataset with a 17% missing rate (M.R.)3. We apply additional random masks over
both the input image features (by assuming one or two entire image feature vectors are missing) and
demographic/diabetic information (by assuming some entries are missing) to increase the missing
rate to 25% and 35%, where for each case 3 different random masks are applied."
OPHTHALMIC DATA,0.18498659517426275,"For this experiment we consider an MLP with 2 hidden layers with 1,000 nodes each for prediction.
The results are shown in Table 2 where the mean and standard deviations (in subscripts) of accuracy
and AUC are reported. Although GIL and GP-VAE result in similar performance in the 25% missing
rate case, GIL still achieves higher accuracy and AUC; these are signiﬁcantly improved, with
signiﬁcantly lower standard deviation over GP-VAE, when the missing rate increases to 35%. In
general, GIL-D outperforms all the other methods, with an exception of the higher standard deviation
of accuracy in the 35% M.R. case, which beneﬁts from the ﬂexibility of the framework we proposed.
With increased missingness, the performance of most baselines drops signiﬁcantly and are close to
the zero-imputation baseline as the image feature vectors occupy most dimensions of the inputs while
imputing with zeros would be a reasonable heuristic."

This work focuses mostly on tabular inputs or time-series; however, we test on MNIST images given
its simple structure, which could be classiﬁed using MLPs and more importantly, because results
from these data are easier to interpret. Speciﬁcally, we test on the MCAR version of MNIST where a
pre-determined portion of pixels (i.e., out of 50%, 70% and 90%) are masked off uniformly at random
from the original images, and the MAR version, which assumes part of the image is always observable
and the positions of missing pixels are determined by a distribution conditioned on features extracted
from the observable portion following Mattei & Frellsen (2019). For each test, the masks are applied"

models4. Note that in the MCAR setting, GP-VAE achieves slightly higher average accuracy than our
method when 50% and 70% of the pixels missing, because it relies on convolutional encoding layers,
which intrinsically have advantages on this dataset. However, GP-VAE’s performance is associated
with higher standard deviation in both cases and is signiﬁcantly outperformed by our method when
90% pixels are missing. The models trained by GIL also signiﬁcantly outperforms the baselines
following the imputation-prediction framework. This suggests that most of the IAs fail to reconstruct
the input data when the missing rate is high (see Figure 1). Moreover, the errors produced during
the imputation are then propagated into the prediction step which results in the inferior performance.
In the MAR setting, the task becomes more challenging as entire rows of pixels could be missing.
Finally, the model trained by GIL outperforms most of the baselines depending on IAs with an
exception of MIWAE, which only slightly outperforms it. Note that GIL-H’s performance is close
to GIL in most of the settings due to the simple structure of the MNIST digits where the missing

CORRELATION BETWEEN IMPUTATION AND PREDICTION PERFORMANCE
In this section we study if imputation error is correlated with the downstream prediction performance,
under the imputation-prediction framework. Each column of Table 4 is obtained by calculating the
Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (Freedman et al., 2007) and its p-value, between the imputation
mean squared error (MSE) and prediction accuracy, across different imputation methods under the
same dataset. It can be observed that the imputation MSE is negatively correlated with prediction
performance for most of the datasets and data with higher M.R. tends to have higher degree of
negative correlation, which indicates that imputation error could be propagated to downstream tasks.

CONCLUSION"
CORRELATION BETWEEN IMPUTATION AND PREDICTION PERFORMANCE,0.225201072386059,"We have developed the GIL method, training DL models (MLPs and LSTMs) to directly perform
inference with incomplete data, without the need for imputation. Existing methods addressing the
problem of missing data mostly follow the two-step (imputation-prediction) framework. However,
the error produced during imputation can be propagated into subsequent tasks, especially when the
data have high missingness rates or small sample sizes. GIL circumvents these issues by applying
importance weighting to the gradients to leverage the information underlying the missingness patterns
in the data. We have evaluated our method by comparing it to the state-of-the-art baselines using IAs
on two real-world datasets and one benchmark dataset."

the reward following the reward function R. Then the training sample x′ for the next iteration is

The MIMIC-III9 contains EHRs obtained from roughly 40,000 patients who
stayed in the ICUs in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012 (Johnson

Figure 4 illustrates the 2-hour observation window, 4-hour early prediction window (EPW) and the
relation between inputs and targets for predictions. Note that each work related to septic shock
predictions adopts a slightly different strategy in terms of selecting lab/vital attributes and the lengths
of the observation and EPW (Mao et al., 2018; Darwiche & Mukherjee, 2018; Yee et al., 2019;
Sheetrit et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019; Khoshnevisan et al., 2020; Fleuren et al., 2020). In this work, the
4-hour EPW allows including sufﬁcient number of subjects which can ensure statistical signiﬁcance
of the results, while the smaller observation window keeps the task challenging. To formulate the
training and testing dataset, we ﬁrst selected 14 commonly used attributes for predictions as suggested

we ﬁrst identify the patients who were diagnosed with sepsis by indexing with the International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases 9 (ICD-9) code 995.91 and 995.92. Then the patients with septic shock
history are selected using ICD-9 code 785.52 with their septic shock onset time determined following
the third international consensus for sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3) standard (Singer et al., 2016).
Finally, we remove the patients whose septic shock onset time was less than 6 hours after admission
to the ICUs since the data is not enough to be formulated as sequences pertaining to the 2-hour
observation and 4-hour prediction window. Consequently, a total of 1,083 septic shock patients are
identiﬁed. To form the non-shock (or control) cohort, ﬁrst 1,083 patients are randomly sampled from
all admissions who have at least 2 hours of records excluding the ones who are in the septic shock

ADDITIONAL RELATED WORKS"
REFERENCES,0.9651474530831099,"RL for Optimization.
This work is also related to approaches that use RL to solve optimization
problems, or to improve existing solvers. For example, Boyan & Moore (2000) proposes a framework
to improve the efﬁciency of local search algorithms by predicting the search outcomes and biasing
toward directions that provide higher returns, which is approached by estimating value functions of
the MDP corresponding to the optimization problem. Recently, Li & Malik (2016) trains RL agents
to perform gradient descent steps over linear regression and neural network models. Similarly, Wei
et al. (2020) introduces a policy network to automatically determine parameters for the plug-and-play
frameworks (Sreehari et al., 2017) which can solve inverse imaging problems. Note that these
methods require complete inputs and cannot be adapted to the problem we consider."

REFERENCES,0.9919571045576407,"In Table 7 it shows the performance of the model described above over the ophthalmic dataset, as
well as MNIST digits with 70% and 90% missing rate (M.R.). Speciﬁcally, hψ(x) is captured by
a neural network with the same architecture as the policy πθ in GIL. The training and testing are
conducted following the same convention (e.g., random seeds that determine the missing entries and
hyper-parameter search) as introduced in Sections 4.3, 4.4 and Appendix D.2, D.3. It can be observed
that the ablation baseline attained similar performance as to GIL-H and zero imputation. The reason
that leads to these results would be that the gradients for training hψ(x) still follow the outer product
format ∆· x⊤which are left to be accounted for. Speciﬁcally, our method is built on top of the
idea, and the experiments in Section 4 also support that if part of the inputs are missing they may not
provide sufﬁcient information to train the prediction models, given the outer product format of the
gradients. Similarly, the gradients for hψ(x) also follow this format and hψ(x) may not be properly
trained directly on incomplete inputs x, which could in general limit the overall performance of the
prediction model."
REFERENCES,0.9946380697050938,"Additional rationales for using RL to obtain gradient importance in GIL.
The ablation base-
line above is closely related to visual attention (VA) models as discussed in Appendix C, and could
be seen as a preliminary version of them where hψ(x) is used to re-weight elements in the inputs
x. VA techniques beneﬁt from the fact that features learned by CNNs are spatially correlated to the
inputs, so the attentions could be directly applied to learned features. To achieve this, VA formulates
the objective as an ELBO which is shown equivalent to the objective of a basic policy gradient RL
algorithm, REINFORCE (Mnih et al., 2014). However, it was not clear how such VA methods could
be adapted to the problem we consider, as the features learned by MLPs or LSTMs are not spatially
correlated with inputs."
REFERENCES,0.9973190348525469,"More on importance versus attentions.
The other baseline, BRITS (Cao et al., 2018), uses
bidirectional RNN to process time-series, with attentions applied to the hidden states of RNNs,
followed by optimizing over imputation and prediction objectives jointly during training. BRITS
is considered as the state-of-the-art method that could predict with incomplete time-series inputs
end-to-end. However, we showed that BRITS is outperformed by our method on the MIMIC dataset;
see Table 1. The reason would be that BRITS requires masking off part of the observed inputs to
constitute the imputation objective; thus, the information provided for model training is even more
limited given the intrinsic > 70% M.R. of MIMIC."
