ABSTRACT,0.0,Abstract
ABSTRACT,0.003952569169960474,"Exploiting pre-trained diffusion models for restoration has recently become a
favored alternative to the traditional task-specific training approach. Previous
works have achieved noteworthy success by limiting the solution space using
explicit degradation models. However, these methods often fall short when faced
with complex degradations as they generally cannot be precisely modeled. In this
paper, we propose PGDiff by introducing partial guidance, a fresh perspective that
is more adaptable to real-world degradations compared to existing works. Rather
than specifically defining the degradation process, our approach models the desired
properties, such as image structure and color statistics of high-quality images, and
applies this guidance during the reverse diffusion process. These properties are
readily available and make no assumptions about the degradation process. When
combined with a diffusion prior, this partial guidance can deliver appealing results
across a range of restoration tasks. Additionally, PGDiff can be extended to handle
composite tasks by consolidating multiple high-quality image properties, achieved
by integrating the guidance from respective tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method not only outperforms existing diffusion-prior-based approaches
but also competes favorably with task-specific models."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.011857707509881422,"Recent years have seen diffusion models achieve outstanding results in synthesizing realistic details
across various content [33, 29, 7, 15, 34]. The rich generative prior inherent in these models opens up
a vast array of possibilities for tasks like super-resolution, inpainting, and colorization. Consequently,
there has been a growing interest in formulating efficient guidance strategies for pre-trained diffusion
models, enabling their successful adaptation to various restoration tasks [9, 42, 20, 37]."
INTRODUCTION,0.015810276679841896,"A common approach [9, 42, 20] is to constrain the solution space of intermediate outputs during
the denoising process1. At each iteration, the intermediate output is modified such that its degraded
counterpart is guided towards the input low-quality (LQ) image. Existing works achieve this goal
either by using a closed-form solution [42, 20] or back-propagating simple losses [9]. These methods
are versatile in the sense that the pre-trained diffusion model can be adapted to various tasks without
fine-tuning, as long as the degradation process is known in advance."
INTRODUCTION,0.019762845849802372,"While possessing great versatility, the aforementioned methods are inevitably limited in generaliz-
ability due to the need for prior knowledge of the degradation process. In particular, a closed-form
solution generally does not exist except for special cases such as linear operators. In addition,
back-propagating losses demand differentiability of the degradation process, which is violated for
many degradations such as JPEG compression. Importantly, degradations in the wild often consist"

colorization task as an example to illustrate our inference pipeline. One may refer to Table 1 for the
corresponding details (e.g., property, classifier, and target) of other tasks. We show that our method
can handle a wide range of tasks, including (a) blind face restoration, (b) face colorization, (c) face
inpainting, and also composite tasks such as (d) old photo restoration."
INTRODUCTION,0.1067193675889328,"of a mixture of degradations [41], and hence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to model them accu-
rately. As a result, existing works generally limit the scope to simplified cases, such as fixed-kernel
downsampling. The generalization to real-world degradations remains a formidable challenge."
INTRODUCTION,0.11067193675889328,"Motivated by the above, instead of modeling the degradation process, we propose to model the
desired properties of high-quality (HQ) images. The merit of such guidance is the agnosticity to the
degradation process. However, it remains unclear what properties are desired and how appropriate
guidance can be constructed. Through our extensive experiments, we find that with diffusion prior
acting as a natural image regularization, one could simply guide the denoising process with easily
accessible properties, such as image structure and color statistics. For example, as shown in Fig. 1,
one could generate plausible outputs simply by providing guidance on the lightness and the statistics
(i.e., mean and variance) of each color channel, without knowing the exact decolorization process.
By constraining the HQ image space, our idea bypasses the difficulty of knowing the prior relation
between LQ and HQ images, thus improving generalizability."
INTRODUCTION,0.11462450592885376,"In this work, we devise a simple yet effective instantiation named PGDiff by introducing partial
guidace. PGDiff adopts classifier guidance [7] to constrain the denoising process. Each image
property corresponds to a classifier, and the intermediate outputs are updated by back-propagating
the gradient computed on the loss between the classifier output and the target property. Since our
partial guidance is agnostic to the degradation process, it can be easily extended to complex tasks by
compositing multiple properties. For instance, the task of old photo restoration can be regarded as a
combination of restoration, inpainting, and colorization, and the resultant guidance is represented as
a weighted sum of the guidance in the respective task. We also demonstrate that common losses such
as perceptual loss [2, 16] and adversarial loss [22] can be incorporated for further performance gain."
INTRODUCTION,0.11857707509881422,"Contributions. Our main contributions include i) a new concept of adapting diffusion models to
restoration without presumptions of the degradation process. We show that it suffices to guide the
denoising process with easily accessible properties in the HQ image space, with diffusion prior acting
as regularization, and ii) partial guidance, a versatile approach that is applicable to a broad range of
image restoration and enhancement tasks. Furthermore, it allows flexible combinations of guidance
for intricate tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of PGDiff on
a variety of challenging tasks including blind face restoration and old photo restoration. We also
demonstrate interesting applications, such as reference-based restoration. The results confirm the
superiority of PGDiff over previous state-of-the-art methods."

restoration tasks, including super-resolution, inpainting, and colorization. One prominent approach in"
RELATED WORK,0.13043478260869565,"this field is the use of pre-trained generative adversarial networks (GANs) [10, 18, 1]. For instance,
GAN-inversion [26, 11, 28] inverts a corrupted image to a latent code, which is then used for
generating a clean image. Another direction is to incorporate the prior into an encoder-decoder
architecture [3, 4, 40, 44], bypassing the lengthy optimization during inference. VQVAE [35] is also
commonly used as generative prior. Existing works [48, 13, 43, 47] generally first train a VQVAE with
a reconstruction objective, followed by a fine-tuning stage to adapt to the subsequent restoration task.
Recently, diffusion models have gained increasing attention due to their unprecedented performance
in various generation tasks [33, 29, 7, 15, 34], and such attention has led to interest in leveraging
them as a prior for restoration."
RELATED WORK,0.13438735177865613,"Diffusion Prior. There has been a growing interest in formulating efficient guidance strategies for
pre-trained diffusion models, enabling their successful adaptation to various restoration tasks [9, 42,
20, 37, 39]. Among them, DDRM [20], DDNM [42], and GDP [9] adopt a zero-shot approach to
adapt a pre-trained diffusion model for restoration without the need of task-specific training. At each
iteration, the intermediate output is modified such that its degraded counterpart is guided towards the
input low-quality image. This is achieved under an assumed degradation process, either in the form
of a fixed linear matrix [42, 20] or a parameterized degradation model [9], with learnable parameters
representing degradation extents. In this work, we also exploit the generative prior of a pre-trained
diffusion model by formulating efficient guidance for it, but unlike existing works that limit the
solution space using explicit degradations [9, 42, 20], we propose to model the desired properties of
high-quality images. Such design is agnostic to the degradation process, circumventing the difficulty
of modeling the degradation process."

PARTIAL GUIDANCE,0.31620553359683795,"Dynamic Guidance Scheme. Our dynamic guidance scheme consists of two components. First, we
observe that the conventional classifier guidance, which adopts a constant gradient scale s, often fails
in guiding the output towards the target value. This is especially unfavourable in tasks where high
similarity to the target is desired, such as inpainting and colorization. To alleviate this problem, we
calculate the gradient scale based on the magnitude change of the intermediate image [37]:"

PARTIAL GUIDANCE,0.32806324110671936,"Second, the conventional classifier guidance typically executes a single gradient step at each denoising
step. However, a single gradient step may not sufficiently steer the output toward the intended target,
particularly when the intermediate outputs are laden with noise in the early phases of the denoising
process. To address this, we allow multiple gradient steps at each denoising step [5] to improve
flexibility. Specifically, one can improve the guidance strength of a specific property by increasing
the number of gradient steps. The process degenerates to the conventional classifier guidance when
the number of gradient steps is set to 1. During inference, users have the flexibility to modulate the
strength of guidance for each property as per their requirements, thus boosting overall controllability."
PARTIAL GUIDANCE,0.33201581027667987,"Composite Guidance. Our partial guidance controls only the properties of high-quality outputs, and
therefore can be easily extended to complex degradations by stacking respective properties. This is
achieved by compositing the classifiers and summing the loss corresponding to each property. An
example of composite tasks is shown in Table 1. In addition, we also demonstrate that additional
losses such as perceptual loss [2, 16] and adversarial loss [22] can be incorporated for further quality
improvement. Experiments demonstrate that our PGDiff achieves better performance than existing
works in complex tasks, where accurate modeling of the degradation process is impossible."

Blind Face Restoration"
BLIND FACE RESTORATION,0.383399209486166,"Partial Guidance Formulation. The objective of blind face restoration is to reconstruct a high-
quality face image given a low-quality input corrupted by unknown degradations. In this task, the most
straightforward approach is to train a network with the MSE loss using synthetic pairs. However, while
these methods are able to remove the degradations in the input, it is well-known [26] that the MSE loss
alone results in over-smoothed outputs. Therefore, extensive efforts have been devoted to improving
the perceptual quality, such as incorporating addition losses (e.g., GAN loss) [22, 10, 16, 46, 8] and
components (e.g., codebook [48, 13, 43, 47, 35] and dictionary [23, 24, 12, 8]). These approaches
often require multi-stage training and experience training instability."
BLIND FACE RESTORATION,0.38735177865612647,"In our framework, we decompose a high-quality face image into smooth semantics and high-frequency
details, and provide guidance solely on the smooth semantics. In this way, the output ˆx0 in each diffu-
sion step is guided towards a degradation-free solution space, and the diffusion prior is responsible for
detail synthesis. Given an input low-quality image y0, we adopt a pre-trained face restoration model
f to predict smooth semantics as partial guidance. Our approach alleviates the training pressure of
the previous models by optimizing model f solely with the MSE loss. This is because our goal is to
obtain smooth semantics without hallucinating unnecessary high-frequency details. Nevertheless, one
can also provide guidance of various forms by selecting different restorers, such as CodeFormer [48].
The loss for classifier guidance is computed as: Lres = ||ˆx0 −f(y0)||2

BLIND FACE RESTORATION,0.4031620553359684,"Quantitative Results on Real-world Datasets. To compare our performance with other methods
quantitatively on real-world datasets, we adopt FID [14] and NIQE [27] as the evaluation metrics and
test on three real-world datasets: LFW-Test [40], WebPhoto-Test [40], and WIDER-Test [48]. LFW-
Test consists of the first image from each person whose name starts with A in the LFW dataset [40],
which are 431 images in total. WebPhoto-Test is a dataset comprising 407 images with medium
degradations collected from the Internet. WIDER-Test contains 970 severely degraded images from
the WIDER Face dataset [40]. As shown in Table 2, our method achieves the best or second-best
scores across all three datasets for both metrics. Although GFP-GAN achieves the best NIQE scores
across datasets, notable artifacts can be observed, as shown in Fig. 2. Meanwhile, our method shows
exceptional robustness and produces visually pleasing outputs without artifacts."
BLIND FACE RESTORATION,0.40711462450592883,"Quantitative Results on Synthetic Dataset. We present a quantitative evaluation on the synthetic
CelebRef-HQ dataset [24] in Table 3. Considering the importance of identity-preserving in blind
face restoration, we introduce reference-based restoration in Sec. 4.5 in addition to the general
restoration in Sec. 4.1. Table 3 shows that our methods achieve best or second best scores across both
no-reference (NR) metrics for image quality (i.e., FID and MUSIQ) and full-reference (FR) metrics
for identity preservation (i.e., LPIPS and IDS). Since we employ heavy degradation settings when
synthesizing CelebRef-HQ, it is noteworthy that identity features are largely distorted in severely
corrupted input images. Thus, it is almost impossible to predict an identity-preserving face without
any additional identity information. Nevertheless, with our reference-based restoration, we observe
that a high-quality reference image of the same person helps generate personal characteristics that are
highly similar to the ground truth. The large enhancement of identity preservation is also indicated in
Table 3, where our reference-based method achieves the highest IDS, increasing by 0.32."

Face Colorization"
FACE COLORIZATION,0.4150197628458498,"Partial Guidance Formulation. Motivated by color space decomposition (e.g., YCbCr, YUV),
we decompose our guidance into lightness and color, and provide respective guidance on the two
aspects. For lightness, the input image acts as a natural target since it is a homogeneous-color image.
Specifically, we guide the output lightness towards that of the input using the simple rgb2gray
operation. Equivalently, the loss is formulated as follows: Ll = ||rgb2gray(ˆx0) −rgb2gray(y0)||2
2.
The lightness guidance can also be regarded as a dense structure guidance. This is essential in
preserving image content."
FACE COLORIZATION,0.4189723320158103,"With the lightness guidance constraining the structure of the output, we could guide the color synthesis
process with a lenient constraint – color statistics (i.e., mean and variance of each color channel).
In particular, we construct the target by applying AdaIN [18] to ˆx0, using a pre-determined set of
color statistics for each R, G, B channel. Then we push ˆx0 towards the color-normalized output:
Lc = ||ˆx0 −sg (AdaIN(ˆx0, P)) ||2
2, where P refers to the set of color statistics and sg(·) denotes the
stop-gradient operation [35]. The overall loss is formulated as: Lcolor = Ll + α · Lc, where α is
a constant that controls the relative importance of the structure and color guidance. To construct a
universal color tone, we compute the average color statistics from a selected subset of the CelebA-HQ
dataset [17]. We find that this simple strategy suffices to produce faithful results. Furthermore, our
PGDiff can produce outputs with diverse color styles by computing the color statistics from different
reference images."
FACE COLORIZATION,0.42292490118577075,"Experimental Results. As shown in Fig. 3, GDP [9] and DDNM [42] lack the capability to produce

Therefore, we cast this problem as a joint task of restoration, colorization, and inpainting3. Similar to
face colorization that composites the loss for each property, we composite the respective loss in each

Reference-Based Restoration"
REFERENCE-BASED RESTORATION,0.5138339920948617,"Partial Guidance Formulation. In reference-based restoration, a reference image from the same
identity is given to improve the resemblance of personal details in the output image. Most existing
works exploiting diffusion prior [9, 42, 20, 45] are not applicable to this task as there is no direct
transformation between the reference and the target. In contrast, our partial guidance is extensible to
more complex tasks simply by compositing multiple losses. In particular, our PGDiff can incorporate
personal identity as a partial attribute of a facial image. By utilizing a reference image and incor-
porating the identity loss into the partial guidance, our framework can achieve improved personal
details. We extract the identity features from the reference image using a pre-trained face recognition
network, such as ArcFace [6]. We then include the negative cosine similarity to the loss term Lres
in blind face restoration (Sec. 4.1): Lref = Lres −β · sim(vˆx0, vr), where β controls the relative
weight of the two losses. Here sim(·) represents the cosine similarity, and vˆx0 and vr denote the
ArcFace features of the predicted denoised image and the reference, respectively."
REFERENCE-BASED RESTORATION,0.5177865612648221,"Experimental Results. We use the CelebRef-HQ dataset [24], which contains 1, 005 entities and
each person has 3 to 21 high-quality images. To build testing pairs, for each entity, we choose one
image and apply heavy degradations as the input, and then we select another image from the same
identity as the reference. In Fig. 6, we observe that without the identity loss term sim(vˆx0, vr), some
of the personal details such as facial wrinkles and eye color cannot be recovered from the distorted
inputs. With the additional identity loss as guidance, such fine details can be restored. In addition,
our PGDiff can be used to improve identity preservation of arbitrary face restorers. For instance, as
shown in Fig. 7 (a), by using CodeFormer [48] as our restorer and incorporating the identity loss,
the fine details that CodeFormer alone cannot restore can now be recovered. Quantitative results are
included in Table 3 and discussed in Sec. 4.1."

ABLATION STUDIES,0.5612648221343873,"Effectiveness of Dynamic Guidance Weight. We first investigate the effectiveness of dynamic
guidance weight snorm in the face inpainting task, where the unmasked regions of the output image
should be of high similarity to that of the input. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), without the dynamic
guidance weight, although plausible content can still be generated in the masked area, the similarity
and sharpness of the unmasked regions are remarkably decreased compared with the input. With
snorm replacing the constant s, the output is of high quality with unmasked regions nicely preserved.
The results indicate that our dynamic guidance weight is the key to ensuring high similarity to the
target during the guidance process."
ABLATION STUDIES,0.5652173913043478,"Effectiveness of Multiple Gradient Steps. To verify the effectiveness of multiple gradient steps, we
compare the blind restoration results with the number of guidance steps N set to be 1, 2, and 3. While
N = 1 is just the conventional classifier guidance, we set N = 2 during the first 0.5T steps and set
N = 3 during the first 0.3T steps. As shown in Fig. 8 (b), artifacts are removed and finer details
are generated as N increases. These results suggest that multiple gradient steps serve to improve the
strength of guiding the output toward the intended target, particularly when the intermediate outputs
are laden with noise in the early phases of the denoising process."

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.5731225296442688,"The generalizability of existing diffusion-prior-based restoration approaches is limited by their
reliance on prior knowledge of the degradation process. This study aims to offer a solution that
alleviates this constraint, thereby broadening its applicability to the real-world degradations. We find
that through directly modeling high-quality image properties, one can reconstruct faithful outputs
without knowing the exact degradation process. We exploit the synthesizing power of diffusion models
and provide guidance only on properties that are easily accessible. Our proposed PGDiff with partial
guidance is not only effective but is also extensible to composite tasks through aggregating multiple
properties. Experiments demonstrate that PGDiff outperforms diffusion-prior-based approaches in
both homogeneous and composite tasks and matches the performance of task-specific methods."

Restorer Design"
REFERENCES,0.8221343873517787,"Network Structure. In the blind face restoration task, given an input low-quality (LQ) image y0,
we adopt a pre-trained face restoration model f to predict smooth semantics as partial guidance. In
this work, we employ the ×1 generator of Real-ESRGAN [41] as our restoration backbone. The
network follows the basic structure of SRResNet [22], with RRDB being its basic blocks. In a ×1
generator, the input image is first downsampled 4 times by a pixel unshuffling [31] layer before any
convolution operations. In our work, we deal with 512 × 512 input/output pairs, which means that
most computation is done only in a 128 × 128 resolution scale. To employ it as the restorer f, we
modify some of its settings. Empirically we find that adding xt and t as the input alongside y0 can
enhance the sample quality in terms of sharpness. Consequently, the input to f is a concatenation of
y0, xt, and t, with t embedded with the sinusoidal timestep embeddings [36]."
REFERENCES,0.8260869565217391,"Training Details. f is implemented with the PyTorch framework and trained using four NVIDIA
Tesla V100 GPUs at 200K iterations. We train f with the FFHQ [18] and CelebA-HQ [17] datasets
and form training pairs by synthesizing LQ images Il from their HQ counterparts Ih, following
a common pipeline with a second-order degradation model [41, 23, 40, 44]. Since our goal is to
obtain smooth semantics without hallucinating unnecessary high-frequency details, it is sufficient to
optimize the model f solely with the MSE loss."
