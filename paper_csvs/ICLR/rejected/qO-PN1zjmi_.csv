ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0023094688221709007,"Despite their excellent performance on in-distribution (ID) data, deep neural net-
works often conﬁdently predict on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples that come
from novel classes instead of ﬂagging them for expert evaluation. Even though
conventional OOD detection algorithms can distinguish far OOD samples, cur-
rent methods that can identify near OOD samples require training with labeled
data that is very similar to these near OOD samples.
In turn, we develop a
new ensemble-based procedure for semi-supervised novelty detection (SSND) that
only utilizes a mixture of unlabeled ID and OOD samples to achieve good detec-
tion performance on near OOD data. It crucially relies on regularization to pro-
mote diversity on the OOD data while preserving agreement on ID data. Extensive
comparisons of our approach to state-of-the-art SSND methods on standard im-
age data sets (SVHN/CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100) and medical image data sets reveal
signiﬁcant gains with negligible increase in computational cost 1."

INTRODUCTION,0.006928406466512702,"Despite achieving great in-distribution (ID) performance, deep neural networks (DNN) often have
trouble dealing with samples in the test set that are out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e. test inputs that are
unlike the data seen during training. For example, DNNs often make incorrect predictions with high
conﬁdence when new unseen classes emerge over time (e.g. undiscovered bacteria Ren et al. (2019),
new diseases Katsamenis et al. (2020)), or when data suffers from distribution shift (e.g. corruptions
Lu et al. (2019), environmental changes Kumar et al. (2020))."

INTRODUCTION,0.011547344110854504,"If the labels of these OOD samples follow the
same conditional probability distribution as the
training set Shimodaira (2000), it is most desir-
able to output calibrated uncertainty estimates
in addition to a single predicted value, as in
Neal (1996); Gal & Ghahramani (2016); Ma-
linin & Gales (2018); Lakshminarayanan et al.
(2017). In contrast, when this assumption does
not hold and some inputs might come from pre-
viously unseen classes, we would like to detect
such novel samples and bring them to the at-
tention of experts. More speciﬁcally, in novelty
detection, we want to detect inputs x that sat-
isfy PX(x) < α for a small threshold α, where
PX is the marginal training (ID) distribution."

are known as open-set recognition and OOD detection methods. In what follows, we use the terms

INTRODUCTION,0.04387990762124711,"Numerous novelty detection methods are successful for simple benchmarks where the OOD samples
are far from the training samples (such as SVHN vs CIFAR10). As Winkens et al. (2020) and a
number of concurrent works (Tack et al., 2020; Fort et al., 2021) recently noted, these methods
however have subpar performance on near OOD data, for instance when OOD samples are drawn
from unseen classes from the same data set (e.g. CIFAR100 vs CIFAR10). A recent method that
is reported to have high near OOD detection performance involves tuning large models pretrained
on ImageNet21k (Fort et al., 2021) and, hence, arguably relies on using during training OOD data
that contains classes that are close to the unseen CIFAR classes during test time. However, in many
scientiﬁc applications that use, for instance, medical or satellite images, such large data sets for
pretraining are not available. In particular, truly novel classes will be inherently dissimilar from any
previously available data while still sharing some of the same characteristics."
INTRODUCTION,0.046189376443418015,"Instead, a more realistic scenario assumes access to a small batch of unlabeled test data that includes
ID and OOD samples without knowing which are the outliers. We can use this set during train-
ing to ultimately perform well on future samples (i.e. semi-supervised novelty detection (SSND)
(Blanchard et al., 2010)) or to detect outliers from that particular test batch itself (reminiscent of
transductive OOD detection (Scott & Blanchard, 2008)). Even though using unlabeled data has the
potential to improve detection performance as argued in Scott & Blanchard (2009), existing SSND
methods for deep neural networks (Kiryo et al., 2017; Yu & Aizawa, 2019; Guo et al., 2020; Zhang
et al., 2020b) do not leverage the unlabeled set well enough to improve near OOD detection perfor-
mance, as shown in Figure 1. This includes previous methods that try to obtain a diverse ensemble
and use it for novelty detection, such as MCD (Yu & Aizawa, 2019)."

We assume that, apart from class-labeled training data, we also have access to a small batch of
unlabeled data drawn from the test distribution. It consists of ID and OOD data without explicitly
knowing which samples are ID and OOD. SSND methods attempt to detect OOD samples from a
new batch drawn from the same test distribution (Blanchard et al., 2010; M˜unoz-Mar´ı et al., 2010;
du Plessis et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2018). This is similar to the goal of approaches that use unlabeled
data for learning with augmented classes (U-LAC) (Da et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,
2020b). The SSND setting is related to transductive novelty detection (Scott & Blanchard, 2008;

however, struggle to learn the density from ﬁnite samples when the data is high-dimensional. Alter-
natively, one-class classiﬁcation (M˜unoz-Mar´ı et al., 2010; Ruff et al., 2020; Sohn et al., 2021) and
PU learning approaches (du Plessis et al., 2014; Kiryo et al., 2017) try to directly learn a discrimina-

disagreement using unlabeled data and regularization via early stopping (refer to the following the-
oretical works on early stopping implicitly restricting model complexity Yao et al. (2007); Raskutti
et al. (2013); Wei et al. (2017)). Previous methods have also tried to leverage a set of unlabeled
data to obtain more diverse ensembles for OOD detection (Yu & Aizawa, 2019; Jain et al., 2020)
or for better predictive performance(Bennett et al., 2002; Zhang & Zhou, 2010). The Maximum
discrepancy method (MCD), the only candidate that can be used for our large-scale datasets, tends
to result in ensembles that do not disagree enough on OOD data, resulting in subpar performance
(see Figure 9a in Appendix B)."
DISAGREEMENT VIA ARTIFICIAL LABELS AND REGULARIZATION VIA EARLY STOPPING,0.18937644341801385,"We argue that Algorithm 1 when regularized via early stopping succeeds based on two observations

samples Yilmaz & Heckel (2019); Li et al. (2020); Song et al. (2020); Liu et al. (2020); Xia et al.

while we 2) use the model at an earlier stopping time that achieves high validation accuracy while
enough of the samples in the U have been ﬁt. We now give a more detailed argument why such a

models from ﬁtting training samples with label noise, which, in our case, amounts to the incorrectly
labeled subset (U ¬c
ID , c). In Proposition A.1 in Appendix A we provide a rigorous proof based on
previous theoretical results that establishes the existence of such an optimal stopping time under
mild assumptions on the data distributions.
To ﬁnd the best stopping time in practice, we use a validation set of labeled ID points to select
an intermediate checkpoint before convergence. As a model starts to ﬁt (U ¬c
ID , c), i.e. the wrongly
labeled ID samples in UID, it also predicts the label c on some validation ID points, leading to a
decrease in validation accuracy, as shown in Figure 5. In our experiments, we wait for one epoch
to allow for the ﬁne-tuning to have any effect at all, and then pick the iteration with the largest
validation accuracy (indicated by the vertical line in the ﬁgure). In Appendix I we show that the
trend depicted in Figure 5 persists for various different data sets.
Finally, we note that instead of early stopping we could also explicitly regularize using dropout
or weight decay. However, running a grid search to select the right hyperparameters can be more
computationally expensive than simply using one run of the training process to select the optimal
stopping time."

BASELINES,0.23556581986143188,"We compare our method against a wide range of baselines that require different access to OOD data
for training, as indicated in Table 1.
Semi-supervised novelty detection.
We primarily compare our method to approaches that can be
used in the semi-supervised setting for deep neural networks, in which a small set of unlabeled ID
and OOD samples is available. The MCD method Yu & Aizawa (2019) trains an ensemble of two
classiﬁers with different types of predictive distributions on the unlabeled samples: one model gives
high-entropy predictions, while the other has low entropy. Notably, this method uses oracle OOD
data for hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning du Plessis et al.
(2014) considers a binary classiﬁcation setting, in which the labeled data comes from one class (i.e.
ID samples, in our case), while the unlabeled set contains a mixture of samples from both classes.
Crucially, PU learning methods, like nnPU Kiryo et al. (2017), require oracle knowledge of the ratio
of OOD samples in the unlabeled set.
In addition to these methods, we propose two more baselines that use an unlabeled set. Firstly,
we present a version of the Mahalanobis approach (Mahal-U) that is calibrated using the unlabeled
set. Secondly, since PU learning requires access to the OOD ratio of the unlabeled set, we also
consider a less burdensome alternative: a binary classiﬁer trained to separate the training data from
the unlabeled set and regularized with early stopping like our method.
Unsupervised novelty detection.
When it comes to methods that use no OOD data for training,
the current SOTA on the usual benchmarks is the Gram method Sastry & Oore (2019). Other ap-
proaches that use no OOD data include vanilla ensembles Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017), deep
generative models that tend to give undesirable results for OOD detection Kirichenko et al. (2020),
or various Bayesian approaches that are often poorly calibrated on OOD data Ovadia et al. (2019).
Other methods.
We also compare with Outlier Exposure Hendrycks et al. (2019) and Deep Prior
Networks (DPN) Malinin & Gales (2018) which use TinyImages as known outliers during training,
irrespective of the OOD set used for evaluation (A-UND). On the other hand, the Mahalanobis
baseline Lee et al. (2018) is tuned on samples from the same OOD distribution used for evaluation
(SND). Preliminary analyses revealed that generative models and one-class classiﬁcation methods
perform poorly on near OOD data sets (see also Appendix E.2).
Choice of hyperparameters.
For all the baselines, we use the default hyperparameters suggested
by their authors on the same ID data set. The Gram method requires laborious hyperparameter tuning
for multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models, so we do not consider it for the MNIST and FMNIST data"

OUR METHOD AND EVALUATION"
OUR METHOD AND EVALUATION,0.2678983833718245,"ERD.
We present results for two ﬂavors of our method. For one, we ﬁne-tune each model in
the ensemble with early stopping, starting from weights that are pretrained on the labeled ID set S
(ERD). We also train the models from random initializations (ERD++) that can obtain slightly better
OOD detection at the cost of more training iterations. We train ensembles of K = 5 MLP models
for MNIST and FMNIST and ResNet20 He et al. (2016) networks for the other settings (results
for other architectures and ensemble sizes are presented in Appendix E.7 and E.8, respectively).
We choose the arbitrary label assigned to the unlabeled set at random, without replacement (see
Appendix E.8 for a discussion on the impact of the choice of arbitrary label). For each model in
the ensemble we perform post-hoc early stopping: we train for 10 epochs (100 epochs for ERD++)
and select the iteration with the lowest validation loss. The other hyperparameters for training are
chosen to maximize validation accuracy on the ID data.
Evaluation.
As in standard hypothesis testing problems, choosing different thresholds for reject-
ing the null hypothesis leads to different false positive and true positive rates (FPR and TPR, re-
spectively). The ROC curve follows the FPR and the TPR for all possible threshold values and the
area under the curve (AUROC; larger values are better) captures the performance of a statistical test
without having to select a speciﬁc threshold. In addition to the AUROC, we also use the TNR at a
TPR of 95% (TNR@95; larger values are better) for evaluation.7"

MAIN RESULTS,0.27251732101616627,"Table 2 summarizes the main empirical results. On the easy scenarios (top part of the table) most
methods achieve near-perfect OOD detection with AUROC close to 1. However, on the novelty
detection scenarios (bottom part), ERD has a clear edge over other baselines, even when they are
calibrated on oracle OOD data, or when they use the true OOD ratio of the unlabeled set, e.g.
nnPU. The substantial gap between ERD and other approaches, both in average AUROC and average
TNR@95, indicates that our method lends itself well to practical situations when accurate OOD
detection is critical. We note that repeated runs of ERD show a small variance σ2 < 0.01 in the
detection metrics. In Appendix E we show that our method successfully identiﬁes OOD samples
with mild distribution shift (e.g. corrupted CIFAR10 Hendrycks & Dietterich (2019), CIFAR10v2

CONCLUSION
In this section, we discuss the possible limitations of using ERD in practice before summarizing the
advantages compared to other methods and outlining potential avenues for future work.
Discussion on potential limitations of ERD and SSND.
First, as mentioned in Section 3.3, ERD
requires the OOD samples in the unlabeled set to be representative of the OOD distribution. Even
though this may not be realistic for anomaly detection where outliers are rare, it may very well be
feasible when a novel class (such as a disease like COVID-19) emerges at inference time. We em-
pirically investigate the impact on the performance of ERD of the size and the ratio of OOD samples
in the unlabeled set (
|UOOD|
|UID|+|UOOD|). We ﬁnd that there is a broad spectrum of values for which
ERD maintains a good performance, as indicated in Figure 6b (see also Appendix H). Moreover, in
Appendix I and J we provide insight as to why near OOD data affects the performance of ERD."
CONCLUSION,0.2909930715935335,"Another limitation concerns the general applicability of SSND: the OOD data in the unlabeled set
used for ﬁne-tuning needs to match the OOD data at test time. In the following we argue using an
example that i) it may be inherently valuable to predict the OOD samples in the unlabeled set itself;
and ii) ERD allows for a different test OOD distribution, at the cost of a slight delay.
Consider, for instance, a medical center that uses an automated system for real-time diagnosis and
an ofﬂine system which runs at the end of each week, for novelty detection. All the X-rays collected
during the week constitute the unlabeled set U that the SSND method may then use for training. If
a quickly spreading novel disease circulates the patient population, the detection model can identify
the OOD samples that are then shown to the scarcely available experts. While the experts are exam-
ining the peculiar X-rays in the course of the next week, the model helps to collect more instances
of the same new condition and can already encourage clinicians to practice extra caution when di-
agnosing these patients. Since the novelty detection algorithm is run every week, new diseases are
identiﬁed with a delay of at most a week – the time it takes to collect an unlabeled set. Since new dis-
eases emerge seldomly and the beneﬁts of even delayed identiﬁcation greatly outweigh the waiting
time, SSND approaches are particularly suitable to this practical scenario."
CONCLUSION,0.29330254041570436,"Summary and future work.
We would like to stress once again that a signiﬁcant advantage of the
SSND setting is that it does not require any labeled or oracle OOD data during ﬁne-tuning, unlike
many other related works summarized in Table 1. The only other approach that achieves comparable
performance to our method (see Appendix E.2) uses a large transformer model pretrained on a much
larger data set (Fort et al., 2021). At the same time, computationally, ERD reaches the optimal
stopping time within the ﬁrst 10 epochs on all the data sets we consider, which amounts to around
6 minutes of training time if the models in the ensemble are ﬁne-tuned in parallel on NVIDIA
1080 Ti GPUs. Other ensemble diversiﬁcation methods require training different models for each
hyperparameter choice and have training losses that cannot be easily parallelized.
In conclusion, we propose a procedure that succeeds in exploiting unlabeled data to generate an
ensemble with regularized disagreement, with remarkable novelty detection performance. We leave
as future work a thorough investigation into the inﬂuence of the labeling scheme of the unlabeled
set on the sample complexity of the method, as well as an analysis of the trade-off governed by the
complexity of the model class of the classiﬁers."

DISAGREEMENT SCORE FOR OOD DETECTION"
PN,0.5542725173210161,"As we argue in Section 3.3, Algorithm 1 produces an ensemble that disagrees on OOD data, and
hence, we want to devise a scalar score that reﬂects this model diversity. Previous works Laksh-
minarayanan et al. (2017); Ovadia et al. (2019) ﬁrst average the softmax predictions of the mod-
els in the ensemble and then use the entropy as a metric, i.e. (H ◦Avg)(f1(x), ..., fK(x)) :=

detection performance for two aggregation scores: (H ◦Avg) (Left) and (Avg ◦ρ) with ρ(f1(x), f2(x)) =
1sgn(f1(x))̸=sgn(f2(x)) (Right). The two metrics achieve similar TPRs, but using (H◦Avg) instead of our score,
(Avg◦ρ), leads to more false positives, since the former simply ﬂags as OOD a band around the averaged model
(solid black line) and does not take advantage of the ensemble’s diversity."
PN,0.5773672055427251,"score in Equation 4. Recall that varying thresholds yield different true negative and true positive
rates (TNR and TPR, respectively) for a given statistic. In the sketch in Figure 7 we show that
the score we propose, (Avg ◦ρ), achieves a higher TNR compared to (H ◦Avg), for a ﬁxed TPR,
which is a common way of evaluating statistical tests. Notice that the detection region for (H ◦Avg)
is always limited to a band around the average model for any threshold value t0. In order for the
(H ◦Avg) to have large TPR, this band needs to be wide, leading to many false positives. Instead,
our disagreement score exploits the diversity of the models to more accurately detect OOD data."
PN,0.5796766743648961,"Figure 8: Relying only on the randomness of SGD and of the weight initialization to diversify
models is not enough, as it often yields similar classiﬁers. Each column shows a different predictor
trained from random initializations with Adam. All models have the same 1-hidden layer MLP
architecture."
PN,0.581986143187067,"We now provide further quantitative evidence to support the intuition presented in Figure 7. The
aggregation metric is tailored to exploit ensemble diversity, which makes it particularly beneﬁcial for
ERD. On the other hand, Vanilla Ensembles only rely on the stochasticity of the training process and
the random initializations of the weights to produce diverse models, which often leads to classiﬁers
that are strikingly similar as we show in Figure 8 for a few 2D data sets. As a consequence, using our
disagreement score (Avg◦ρ) for Vanilla Ensembles can sometimes hurt OOD detection performance.
To see this, consider the extreme situation in which the models in the ensemble are identical, i.e.
f1 = f2. Then it follows that (Avg ◦ρ)(f1(x), f2(x)) = 0, for all test points x and for any function
ρ that satisﬁes the distance axioms."
PN,0.5842956120092379,"We note that the disagreement score that we propose takes a form that is similar to previous diversity
scores, e.g. Zhang & Zhou (2010); Yu & Aizawa (2019). In the context of regression, one can
measure uncertainty using the variance of the outputs metric previously employed in works such
as Gal & Ghahramani (2016). However, we point out that using the output variance requires that
the ensemble is the result of sampling from a random process (e.g. sampling different training data
for the models, or sampling different parameters from a posterior). In our framework, we obtain
the ensemble by solving a different optimization problem for each of the models by assigning a
different label to the unlabeled data. Therefore, despite their similarities, our disagreement score
and the output variance are, on a conceptual level, fundamentally different metrics."

ERD (see Section 3.3), then there is a clear advantage to using a score that, unlike (H ◦Avg), takes

how we choose their hyperparameters. For all baselines we use the hyperparameters suggested by
the authors for the respective data sets (e.g. different hyperparameters for CIFAR10 or ImageNet).
For all methods, we use pretrained models provided by the authors. However, we note that for the
novel-class settings, pretraining on the entire training set means that the model is exposed to the
OOD classes as well, which is undesirable. Therefore, for these settings we pretrain only on the
split of the training set that contains the ID classes. Since the classiﬁcation problem is similar to the
original one of training on the entire training set, we use the same hyperparameters that the authors
report in the original papers."

Appendix E.7."
PN,0.6304849884526559,"• Vanilla Ensembles Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017): We train an ensemble on the training
set according to the true labels. For a test sample, we average the outputs of the softmax
probabilities predicted by the models, and use the entropy of the resulting distribution as the
score for the hypothesis test described in Section 3.2. We use ensembles of 5 models, with
the same architecture and hyperparameters as the ones used for ERD. Hyperparameters are
tuned to achieve good validation accuracy.
• Gram method Sastry & Oore (2019): The Gram baseline is similar to the Mahalanobis
method in that both use the intermediate feature representations obtained with a deep neural
network to determine whether a test point is an outlier. However, what sets the Gram
method apart is the fact that it does not need any OOD data for training or calibration.
We use the pretrained models provided by the authors, or train our own, using the same
methodology as described for the Mahalanobis baseline. For OOD detection, we use the
code published by the authors. We note that for MLP models, the Gram method is difﬁcult
to tune and we could not ﬁnd a conﬁguration that works well, despite our best efforts and
following the suggestions proposed during our communication with the authors.
• Deep Prior Networks (DPN) Malinin & Gales (2018): DPN is a Bayesian Method that
trains a neural network (Prior Network) to parametrize a Dirichlet distribution over the
class probabilities. We train a WideResNet WRN-28-10 for 100 epochs using SGD with
momentum 0.9, with an initial learning rate of 0.01, which is decayed by 0.2 at epochs 50,
70, and 90. For MNIST, we use EMINST/Letters as OOD for tuning. For all other settings,
we use TinyImages as OOD for tuning.
• Outlier Exposure Hendrycks et al. (2019): This approach makes a model’s softmax pre-
dictions close to the uniform distribution on the known outliers, while maintaining a good
classiﬁcation performance on the training distribution. We use the WideResNet architec-
ture (WRN) Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016). For ﬁne-tuning, we use the settings rec-
ommended by the authors, namely we train for 10 epochs with learning rate 0.001. For
training from scratch, we train for 100 epochs with an initial learning rate of 0.1. When
the training data set is either CIFAR10/CIFAR100 or ImageNet, we use the default WRN
parameters of the author’s code, namely 40 layers, 2 widen-factor, droprate 0.3. When the
training dataset is SVHN, we use the author’s recommended parameters of 16 layers, 4
widen-factor and droprate 0.4. All settings use the cosine annealing learning rate sched-
uler provided with the author’s code, without any modiﬁcations. For all settings, we use
TinyImages as known OOD data during training. In Section E.5 we show results for known
OOD data that is similar to the OOD data used for testing.
• Mahalanobis Lee et al. (2018): The method pretrains models on the labeled training data.
For a test data point, it uses the intermediate representations of each layer as “extracted fea-
tures”. It then performs binary classiﬁcation using logistic regression using these extracted
features. In the original setting, the classiﬁcation is done on “training” ID vs “training”
OOD samples (which are from the same distribution as the test OOD samples). Further-
more, hyperparameter tuning for the optimal amount of noise is performed on validation
ID and OOD data. We use the WRN-28-10 architecture, pretrained for 200 epochs. The
initial learning rate is 0.1, which is decayed at epochs 60, 120, and 160 by 0.2. We use
SGD with momentum 0.9, and the standard weight decay of 5 · 10−4. The code published
for the Mahalanobis method performs a hyperparameter search automatically for each of
the data sets."

tection performance. We perform a grid search over the learning rate and the threshold
that appears in the nnPU regularizer and pick the option with the best validation accuracy

PN,0.6420323325635104,"• Maximum Classiﬁer Discrepancy (MCD) Yu & Aizawa (2019): The MCD method trains
two classiﬁers at the same time, and makes them disagree on the unlabeled data, while
maintaining good classiﬁcation performance. We use the WRN-28-10 architecture as sug-
gested in the paper. We did not change the default parameters which came with the author’s
code, so weight decay is 10−4, and the optimizer is SGD with momentum 0.9. When avail-
able (for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100), we use the pretrained models provided by the authors.
For the other training datasets, we use their methodology to generate pretrained models:
We train a WRN-28-10 for 200 epochs. The learning rate starts at 0.1 and drops by a factor
of 10 at 50% and 75% of the training progress."

the inliers). The early stopping iteration is chosen to minimize the classiﬁcation errors on
a validation set that contains only ID data (recall that we do not assume to know which are
the OOD samples)."

set and the mixed unlabeled set, that contains both ID and OOD data. We use regularization
to prevent the trivial solution for which the entire unlabeled set is predicted as OOD. Unlike
PU learning, the binary classiﬁer does not require that the OOD ratio in the test distribution
is known. The approach is similar to a method described in Scott & Blanchard (2008)
which also requires that the OOD ratio of the unlabeled set is known. We tune the learning
rate and the weight of the unlabeled samples in the training loss by performing a grid search
and selecting the conﬁguration with the best validation accuracy, computed on a holdout
set containing only ID samples. We note that the binary classiﬁer that appears in Section F
in the medical benchmark, is not the same as this baseline. For more details on the binary
classiﬁer that appears in the medical data experiments we refer the reader to Cao et al.

TRAINING CONFIGURATION FOR ERD"

generalization and do not perform further hyperparameter tuning for the different OOD data sets on
which we evaluate our approach. We point out that, if the ID labeled set is known to suffer from
class imbalance, subpopulation imbalance or label noise, any training method that addresses these
issues can be used instead of standard empirical risk minimization to train our ensemble (e.g. see
the works of Sagawa et al. (2020); Li et al. (2020) etc)."

OOD DETECTION FOR DATA WITH COVARIATE SHIFT"

PN,0.745958429561201,"We want to stress that in practice one may not be interested in identifying all samples with distri-
bution shift as OOD, since a classiﬁer may still produce correct predictions on some of them. In
contrast, when data suffers from covariate shift we can try to learn predictors that perform well on
both the training and the test distribution, and we may use a measure of predictive uncertainty to
identify only those test samples on which the classiﬁer cannot make conﬁdent predictions. Never-
theless, we use these covariate shift settings as a challenging OOD detection benchmark and show

FAR10v2 Recht et al. (2018), a data set meant to be drawn from the same distribution as CIFAR10
(generated from the Tiny Images collection Torralba et al. (2008)). In Recht et al. (2019), the authors
argue that CIFAR10 and CIFAR10v2 come from very similar distributions. They provide supporting
evidence by training a binary classiﬁer to distinguish between them, and observing that the accuracy
that is obtained of 52.9% is very close to random."

work has argued. First, our own binary classiﬁer trained on CIFAR10 vs CIFAR10v2 obtains a test
accuracy of 67%, without any hyperparameter tuning. The model we use is a ResNet20 trained for
200 epochs using SGD with momentum 0.9. The learning rate is decayed by 0.2 at epochs 90, 140,
160 and 180. We use 1600 examples from each data set for training, and we validate using 400

choice of the arbitrary labels and notice that the OOD detection performance metrics do not vary

MEDICAL OOD DETECTION BENCHMARK"

sets, from three different domains: two data sets with chest X-rays, one with fundus imaging and
one with histology images. For each ID data set, the authors consider three different OOD scenarios:"
PN,0.8914549653579676,"1. Use case 1: The OOD data set contains images from a completely different domain, similar
to our category of easy OOD detection settings."

LEARNING CURVES FOR OTHER DATA SETS"

OOD data. Choosing a stopping time before the validation accuracy starts to deteriorate prevents
the model from ﬁtting the arbitrary label on unlabeled ID data."

The learning curves illustrated in Fig-

and the impact that has on training the proposed method. In particular, notice that for CIFAR10[0-4]
vs CIFAR10[5-9] in Figure 20d, the models require more training epochs before reaching an accu-
racy on unlabeled OOD samples of 100%. The learning of the arbitrary label on the OOD samples
is delayed by the fact that the ID and OOD data are similar, and hence, the bias of the correctly la-
beled training set has a strong effect on the predictions of the models on the OOD inputs. Since we"

we end up using models that do not interpolate the arbitrary label on the OOD samples. Therefore,
the ensemble does not disagree on the entirety of the OOD data in the unlabeled set, which leads
to lower OOD detection performance. Importantly, however, our empirical evaluation reveals that
the drop in performance for ERD ensembles is substantially smaller than what we observe for other

EVOLUTION OF DISAGREEMENT SCORE DURING FINE-TUNING"

is impacted by near OOD data."
PN,0.9792147806004619,"Figure 21 reveals that for far OOD data (the left column) the disagreement scores computed on OOD
samples are well separated from the disagreement scores on ID data (note that disagreement on OOD
data is so concentrated around the maximum value of 2 that the boxes are essentially reduced to a line
segment). On the other hand, for near OOD data (the right column) there is sometimes signiﬁcant
overlap between the disagreement scores on ID and OOD data, which leads to the slightly lower
AUROC values that we report in Table 2."
PN,0.9815242494226328,"The ﬁgures also illustrate how the disagreement on the ID data tends to increase as we ﬁne-tune the

samples. Conversely, in most instances one epoch sufﬁces for ﬁtting the arbitrary label on the OOD
data."
