ABSTRACT,0.002331002331002331,"Reward-free, unsupervised discovery of skills is an attractive alternative to the
bottleneck of hand-designing rewards in environments where task supervision is
scarce or expensive. However, current skill pre-training methods, like many RL
techniques, make a fundamental assumption – stationary environments during
training. Traditional methods learn all their skills simultaneously, which makes
it difficult for them to both quickly adapt to changes in the environment, and to
not forget earlier skills after such adaptation. On the other hand, in an evolving or
expanding environment, skill learning must be able to adapt fast to new environment
situations while not forgetting previously learned skills. These two conditions make
it difficult for classic skill discovery to do well in an evolving environment. In this
work, we propose a new framework for skill discovery, where skills are learned one
after another in an incremental fashion. This framework allows newly learned skills
to adapt to new environment or agent dynamics, while the fixed old skills ensure
the agent doesn’t forget a learned skill. We demonstrate experimentally that in
both evolving and static environments, incremental skills significantly outperform
current state-of-the-art skill discovery methods on both skill quality and the ability
to solve downstream tasks. Videos for learned skills and code are made public on:

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.006993006993006993,"Modern successes of Reinforcement Learning (RL) primarily rely on task-specific rewards to learn
motor behavior (Levine et al., 2016; Schulman et al., 2017; Haarnoja et al., 2018; Andrychowicz et al.,
2020). This learning requires well behaved reward signals in solving control problems. The challenge
of reward design is further coupled with the inflexibility in the learned policies, i.e. policies trained
on one task do not generalize to a different task. Not only that, but the agents also generalize poorly
to any changes in the environment (Raileanu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2019). This is in stark contrast
to how biological agents including humans learn (Smith & Gasser, 2005). We continuously adapt,
explore, learn without explicit rewards, and are importantly incremental in our learning (Brandon,
2014; Corbetta & Thelen, 1996)."
INTRODUCTION,0.009324009324009324,"Creating RL algorithms that can similarly adapt and generalize to new downstream tasks has hence
become an active area of research in the RL community (Bellemare et al., 2016; Eysenbach et al.,
2018; Srinivas et al., 2020). One viable solution is unsupervised skill discovery (Eysenbach et al.,
2018; Sharma et al., 2019b; Campos et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020). Here, an agent gets access to a
static environment without any explicit information on the set of downstream tasks or reward functions.
During this unsupervised phase, the agent, through various information theoretic objectives (Gregor
et al., 2016), is asked to learn a set of policies that are repeatable while being different from each other.
These policies are often referred to as behavioral primitives or skills (Kober & Peters, 2009; Peters
et al., 2013; Schaal et al., 2005). Once learned, these skills can then be used to solve downstream
tasks in the same static environment by learning a high-level controller that chooses from the set of
these skills in a hierarchical control fashion (Stolle & Precup, 2002; Sutton et al., 1999; Kulkarni
et al., 2016) or by using Behavior Transfer to aid in agent exploration (Campos et al., 2021). However,
the quality of the skills learned and the subsequent ability to solve downstream tasks are dependent
on the unsupervised objective."

INTRODUCTION,0.03263403263403263,"Figure 1: We present Discovery of Incremental Skills (DISk). As illustrated in (a), DISk learns skills incremen-
tally by having each subsequent skills be diverse from the previous skills while being consistent with itself. DISk
lets us learn skills in environment where dynamics change during training, an example of which is shown in (b):
an Ant environment where a different leg breaks every few episodes. In this environment, DISk’s learned skills’
trajectories are shown in (c) under each broken leg – each color shows a different skill."
INTRODUCTION,0.03496503496503497,"Unfortunately, current objectives for unsupervised skill discovery make a major assumption about
the environment stationarity. Since all skills are simultaneously trained from start to finish, if the
environment changes, every skill is equally exposed to highly non-stationary experience during its
training. Moreover, all skills trying to adapt to the changed environment means that the agent may
catastrophically forget previously learned skills, which is undesirable for an agent with expanding
scope. This severely limits the application of current skill discovery methods in lifelong RL set-
tings (Nareyek, 2003; Koulouriotis & Xanthopoulos, 2008; Da Silva et al., 2006; Cheung et al., 2020),
a simple example of which is illustrated in Figure 1(b), or real-world dynamic settings (Gupta et al.,
2018; Julian et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.037296037296037296,"In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised model-free framework: Discovery of Incremental Skills
(DISk). Instead of simultaneously learning all desired skills, DISk learns skills one after another to
avoid the joint skill optimization problem. In contrast to prior work, we treat each individual skill as
an independent neural network policy without parameter sharing, which further decouples the learned
skills. Given a set of previously learned skills, new skills are optimized to have high state entropy with
respect to previously learned skills, which promotes skill diversity. Simultaneously, each new skill
is also required to have low state entropy within itself, which encourages the skill to be consistent.
Together, these objectives ensure that every new skill increases the diversity of the skill pool while
being controllable (Fig. 1(a)). Empirically, this property enables DISk to generate higher quality
skills and subsequently improve downstream task learning in both dynamic and static environments
compared to prior state-of-the-art skill discovery methods. Especially in evolving environments, DISk
can quickly adapt new skills to the changes in the environment while keeping old skills decoupled
and fixed to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate this property empirically in MuJoCo
navigation environments undergoing varying amounts of change. While DISk was designed for
dynamic, evolving environments, we observe that it performs noticeably better than previous skill
learning methods in static environments like standard MuJoCo navigation environments by improving
skill quality and downstream learning metrics."
INTRODUCTION,0.039627039627039624,"To summarize, this paper provides the following contributions: (a) we propose a new unsupervised
skill discovery algorithm (DISk) that can effectively learn skills in a decoupled manner. (b) We
demonstrate that the incremental nature of DISk lets agents discover diverse skills in evolving or
expanding environments. (c) Even in static environments, we demonstrate that DISk can learn a
diverse set of controllable skills on continuous control tasks that outperform current state-of-the-
art methods on skill quality, as well as in sample and computational efficiency. (d) Finally, we
demonstrate that our learned skills, both from dynamic and static environments, can be used without
any modifications in a hierarchical setting to efficiently solve downstream long-horizon tasks."

aims to maximize a task specific reward rT (s, a) by optimizing the parameters θ of a policy πθ. In
contrast to task-specific RL, where the rewards rT correspond to making progress on that specific
task, methods in unsupervised RL (Bellemare et al., 2016; Eysenbach et al., 2018; Srinivas et al.,
2020) instead optimize an auxiliary reward objective rI that does not necessarily correspond to the
task-specific reward rT ."
BACKGROUND AND PRELIMINARIES,0.05128205128205128,"Incremental Learning: Incremental, lifelong, or continual learning covers a wide variety of problems,
both within and outside of the field of Reinforcement Learning. Some works consider the problem
to fast initialization in a new task Tn+1 given previous tasks Ti, 1 ≤i ≤n (Tanaka & Yamamura,
1997; Fernando et al., 2017), while others focus on learning from a sequence of different domains
D1, · · · , Dt such that at time t + 1, the model does not forget what it has seen so far (Fei et al., 2016;
Li & Hoiem, 2017). Finally, other works have considered a bidirectional flow of information, where
performance in both old and new tasks improves simultaneously with each new task (Ruvolo & Eaton,
2013; Ammar et al., 2015). In all of these cases, there is a distribution shift in the data over time,
which differentiates this problem setting from multi-task learning. Some of these methods (Tanaka
& Yamamura, 1997; Ruvolo & Eaton, 2013; Fei et al., 2016; Ruvolo & Eaton, 2013) learn a set of
independently parametrized models to address this distribution shift over time."
BACKGROUND AND PRELIMINARIES,0.053613053613053616,"Skill Discovery: Often, skill discovery is posited as learning a z-dependent policy πz(a|s; θ) (Eysen-
bach et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2020), where z ∈Z is a latent variable that represents an individual
skill. The space Z hence represents the pool of skills available to an agent. To learn parameters of
the skill policy, several prior works (Hausman et al., 2018; Eysenbach et al., 2018; Campos et al.,
2020; Sharma et al., 2020) propose objectives that diversify the outcomes of different skills while
making the same skill produce consistent behavior."

BACKGROUND AND PRELIMINARIES,0.06060606060606061,"Here, I(S; Z) represents the mutual information between states and skills, which intuitively encour-
ages the skill to control the states being visited. H(A|S, Z) represents the Shannon entropy of actions
conditioned on state and skill, which encourages maximum entropy (Haarnoja et al., 2017) skills.
Operationally, this objective is maximized by model-free RL optimization of an intrinsic reward
function that corresponds to maximizing Equation 1, i.e. rI(s, a|θ) := ˆF(θ), where ˆF(θ) is an
estimate of the objective. Note that the right part of the objective can be directly optimized using
maximum-entropy RL (Haarnoja et al., 2018; 2017)."
BACKGROUND AND PRELIMINARIES,0.06293706293706294,"Other prominent methods such as DADS and off-DADS (Sharma et al., 2019b; 2020) propose to
instead maximize I(S
′; Z|S), the mutual information between the next state s′ and skill conditioned
on the current state. Similar to DIAYN, this objective is maximized by RL optimization of the
corresponding intrinsic reward. However, unlike DIAYN, the computation of the reward is model-
based, as it requires learning a skill-conditioned dynamics model. In both cases, the z-conditioned
skill policy πθ(·|·; z) requires end-to-end joint optimization of all the skills and shares parameters
across skills through a single neural network policy."

in more meaningful diversity in our skills. Hence, in general we estimate the entropy not directly
on raw state s, but under a projection σ(s), where σ captures the meaningful variations in our agent.
Learning such low-dimensional projections is in itself an active research area (Whitney et al., 2019;
Du et al., 2019). Hence, following prior work like Off-DADS and DIAYN that use velocity-based
states, we use a pre-defined σ that gives us the velocity of the agent. We use instantaneous agent
velocity since in locomotion tasks it is a global metric that is generally independent of how long the
agent is run for. Like Off-DADS and DIAYN, we found that a good projection is crucial for success
of an agent maximizing information theoretic diversity."
A PRACTICAL ALGORITHM,0.13286713286713286,"Putting it all together: On any given environment, we can put together the above three ideas to learn
arbitrary number of incremental skills using Algorithm 1. To learn a new skill πM in a potentially
evolved environment, we start with collecting an experience buffer T with states s ∼πm collected
from previous skills. Then, we collect transitions (s, a, s′) by running πM on the environment. We
store this transition in the replay buffer, and also store the projected state σ(s′) in a circular buffer
BUF. Then, to update our policy parameter θM, on each update step, we sample (s, a, s′) from our
replay buffer and calculate the intrinsic reward of that sample. To calculate this, we first find the
kth Nearest Neighbor of σ(s′) within BUF, called σc henceforth. Then, we sample a batch Tb ⊂T ,
and find the kth Nearest Neighbor of σ(s′) within σ(Tb) = {σ(s) | s ∈Tb}, called σd henceforth.
Given these nearest neighbors, we define our consistency penalty rc := ||σ(s′) −σc||2, and our
diversity reward rd := ||σ(s′) −σd||2, which yields an intrinsic reward rI := −αrc + βrd. α and β
are estimated such that the expected value of αrc and βrd are close in magnitude, which is done by
using the mean values of ˆrc and ˆrd from the previous skill πM−1."

about the downstream tasks (Eysenbach et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2019b; 2020). We use two
types of environments: for stationary tasks we use standard MuJoCo environments from OpenAI
Gym (Todorov et al., 2012; Brockman et al., 2016): HalfCheetah, Hopper, Ant, and Swimmer,
visualized in Fig. 4 (left), while for non-stationary environments we use two modified variants of the
Ant environment: one with disappearing blocks, and another with broken legs. Environment details
are provided in Appendix C."

unsupervised skill discovery algorithms mentioned in Section 2, DIAYN (Eysenbach et al., 2018) and
Off-DADS (Sharma et al., 2020). To contextualize the performance of these algorithms, whenever
appropriate, we compare them with a collection of random, untrained policies. To make our compari-
son fair, we give both DIAYN and Off-DADS agents access to the same transformed state, σ(s), that
we use in DISk. Since Off-DADS is conditioned by continuous latents, for concrete evaluations we
follow the same method as the original paper by uniformly sampling N latents from the latent space,
and using them as the N skills from Off-DADS in all our experiments. Exact hyperparameter settings
are described in Appendix D, and our implementation of DISk is attached as supplimentary material."

CAN DISK ADAPTIVELY DISCOVER SKILLS IN EVOLVING ENVIRONMENTS?"
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.1561771561771562,"One of the key hypothesis of this work is that DISk is able to discover useful skills even when the
environment evolves over time. To gauge the extent of DISk’s adaptability, we design two experiments
shown in Fig. 2 (left) and Fig. 1 (b) for judging adaptability of DISk in environments that change in
continuous and discrete manner respectively."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.1585081585081585,"Continuous Change: We create a MuJoCo environment similar to Ant with 40 blocks encircling
the agent. The blocks initially prevent long trajectories in any direction. Then, as we train the agent,
we slowly remove the blocks at three different speeds. If T is the total training time of the agent, in
“fast”, we remove one block per T/40 steps, in “even” we remove two blocks per T/20 training steps, and
in “slow” we remove ten blocks per T/4 training steps. In each of the cases, the environment starts
with a completely encircled agent, and ends with an agent completely free to move in any direction;
across the three environments just the frequency and the magnitude of the evolution changes. This
environment is meant to emulate an expanding environment where new possibilities open up during
training; like a domestic robot being given access to new rooms in the house. The three different
rates of change lets us observe how robust a constant skill addition schedule is with different rates of
change in the world."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.16083916083916083,"In Fig. 2 (middle), we can see how the skill learning algorithms react to the changing environment.
The comparison between Off-DADS and DISk is especially noticeable. The Off-DADS agent latches
onto the first opening of the block-circle, optimizes the skill dynamics model for motions on that
single direction, and ignores further evolution of the environment quite completely. On the other
hand, since the DISk agent incrementally initializes an independent policy per skill, it can easily
adapt to the new, changed environment during the training time of each skill. To quantitatively
measure the diversity of skills learned, we use the Hausdorff distance (Belogay et al., 1997), which is
a topological way of measuring distance between two sets of points (see appendix B.3.) We plot the
mean Hausdorff distance between all endpoints of a skill and all other endpoints in Fig. 2 (right). In

agent, as seen in Fig. 3 (left), performs well
with the broken leg that it was trained on most

leg, this agent forgets previously learned skills
(App. Fig. 7, 8). Conversely, each DISk skill

WHAT QUALITY OF SKILLS ARE LEARNED BY DISK IN A STATIC ENVIRONMENT?"
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.19114219114219114,"While DISk was created to address skill learning in an evolving environment, intuitively it could
work just as well in a static environment. To qualitatively study DISk-discovered skills in static
environments, we plot the trajectories generated by them in Fig. 4 (middle). On the three hardest
environments (Hopper, Ant, and Swimmer), DISk produces skills that cover larger distances than
DIAYN and Off-DADS. Moreover, on Ant and Swimmer, we can see that skills from DISk are quite
consistent with tight packing of trajectories. On the easier HalfCheetah environment, we notice
that DIAYN produces higher quality skills. One reason for this is that both DIAYN and Off-DADS
share parameters across skills, which accelerates skill learning for less complex environments. Also,
note that the performance of DIAYN is worse on the complex environments like Swimmer and Ant.
The DIAYN agent stops learning when the DIAYN discriminator achieves perfect discriminability;
since we are providing the agent and the discriminator with extra information σ(s), in complex
environments like Swimmer or Ant DIAYN achieves this perfect discriminability and then stops
learning. While the performance of DIAYN on Ant may be surprising, it is in line with the observations
by Sharma et al. (2019b; 2020)."

CAN DISK SKILLS ACCELERATE DOWNSTREAM LEARNING?"
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.21445221445221446,"A promise of unsupervised skill discovery methods is that in complicated environments the discovered
skills can accelerate learning on downstream tasks. In our experiments, we find that skills learned by
DISk can learn downstream tasks faster by leveraging the learned skills hierarchically. To examine the
potential advantage of using discovered skills, we set up an experiment similar to the goal-conditioned
hierarchical learning experiment seen in Sharma et al. (2019b). In this experiment, we initialize a
hierarchical Ant agent with the learned skills and task it with reaching an (x, y) coordinate chosen
uniformly from [−15, 15]2. Note that this environment is the standard Ant environment with no
changing dynamics present during evaluations. To highlight the versatility of the skills learned
under evolving environments, we also evaluate the agents that were trained under our evolving Block
environments (see Section 4.2) under the same framework."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.21678321678321677,"We generally find that DISk agents outperform other agents on this hierarchical learning benchmark,
by generally converging within 100-200k steps compared to DIAYN agent never converging and
Off-DADS taking around 500k steps (Fig. 5). This statement holds true regardless of the evolution
dynamics of the environment where the agents were learned, thus showing that DISk provides an
adaptive skill discovery algorithm under a variety of learning circumstances. This property makes
DISk particularly suitable for lifelong learning scenarios where the environment is continuously
evolving."

ABLATION ANALYSIS ON DESIGN CHOICES"
ABLATION ANALYSIS ON DESIGN CHOICES,0.2517482517482518,"We make several design choices that improve DISk. In this section we briefly discuss the two most
important ones. Firstly, our implementation of DISk shares the data collected by the previous skills by
initializing the replay buffer R of a new skill with data from the previous ones. Once initialized with
this replay, the new skill can relabel that experience with its own intrinsic rewards. This method has
shown promise in multi-task RL and hindsight relabelling (Andrychowicz et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020;
Eysenbach et al., 2020). Across our experiments, performing such relabelling improves performance
significantly for the later skills (App. Fig. 10 (left)) as it can reuse vast amounts of data seen by prior
skills. Training details for this experiment is presented in Appendix G."
ABLATION ANALYSIS ON DESIGN CHOICES,0.2540792540792541,"Compared to prior work, DISk not only learns skills incrementally, but also learns independent
neural network policies for each skill. To check if the performance gains in static environment are
primarily due to the incremental addition of skills or the independent policy part, we run a version
of our algorithm where all the independent skills are trained in parallel (App. Fig. 10 (left)) on Ant.
Experimentally, we see that simply training independent skills in parallel does not discover useful
skills; with the parallel variant achieving far lower mean Hausdorff distance. Note that we cannot
have incremental addition of skills without independent policies, at least in the current instantiation of
DISk, without significant modification to the algorithm or the architecture. This is because it is highly
nontrivial to extend or modify a network’s input or parameter space, and the simplest extension is
just a new network which is DISk itself."

section we briefly describe the most relevant ones."
RELATED WORK,0.26107226107226106,"Incremental Learning: Machine learning algorithms have traditionally focused on stationary, non-
incremental learning, where a fixed dataset is presented to the algorithm (Giraud-Carrier, 2000;
Sugiyama & Kawanabe, 2012; Ditzler et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2018; 2017; Smith & Gasser, 2005).
Inspired by studies in child development (Mendelson et al., 1976; Smith & Gasser, 2005; Smith et al.,
1998; Spelke, 1979; Wertheimer, 1961), sub-areas such as curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009;"
RELATED WORK,0.2634032634032634,"Kumar et al., 2010; Murali et al., 2018) and incremental SVMs (Cauwenberghs & Poggio, 2001;
Syed et al., 1999; Ruping, 2001) have emerged, where learning occurs incrementally. We note that
the general focus in these prior work is on problems where a labelled dataset is available. In this work,
we instead focus on RL problems, where labelled datasets or demonstrations are not provided during
the incremental learning. In the context of RL, some prior works consider learning for a sequence of
tasks (Tanaka & Yamamura, 1997; Wilson et al., 2007; Ammar et al., 2015) while other works (Peng
& Williams, 1994; Ammar et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019a;b) create algorithms that can adapt to
changing environments through incremental policy or Q-learning. However, these methods operate in
the task-specific RL setting, where the agent is trained to solve one specific reward function."

Abbeel, 2021) focus on obtaining sufficient coverage in environments. Since our proposed work is
based on skill discovery, it is orthogonal to these prior work and can potentially be combined with
them for additional performance gain. Most related to our work is the sub-field of skill discovery (Ey-
senbach et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2019b; Campos et al., 2020; Gregor et al., 2016; Achiam et al.,
2018; Sharma et al., 2020). A more formal treatment of this is presented in Section 2. Since our
method makes the skill discovery process incremental, it allows for improved performance compared
to DIAYN (Eysenbach et al., 2018) and Off-DADS (Sharma et al., 2020), which is discussed in
Section 4. Finally, we note that skills can also be learned in supervised setting with demonstrations or
rewards (Kober & Peters, 2009; Peters et al., 2013; Schaal et al., 2005; Dragan et al., 2015; Konidaris
et al., 2012; Konidaris & Barto, 2009; Zahavy et al., 2021; Shankar et al., 2020; Shankar & Gupta,

demonstrations are present."
RELATED WORK,0.2727272727272727,"RL with evolving dynamics: Creating RL algorithms that can adapt and learn in environments with
changing dynamics is a longstanding problem (Nareyek, 2003; Koulouriotis & Xanthopoulos, 2008;
Da Silva et al., 2006; Cheung et al., 2020). Recently, a variant of this problem has been studied in
the sim-to-real transfer community (Peng et al., 2018; Chebotar et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2018), where
minor domain gaps between simulation and reality can be bridged through domain randomization.
Another promising direction is online adaptation (Rakelly et al., 2019; Hansen et al., 2020; Yu et al.,
2017) and Meta-RL (Finn et al., 2017; Nagabandi et al., 2018a;b), where explicit mechanisms to
infer the environment are embedded in policy execution. We note that these methods often focus on
minor variations in dynamics during training or assume that there is an underlying distribution of
environment variability, while our framework does not."

DISCUSSION, LIMITATIONS, AND SCOPE FOR FUTURE WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.2773892773892774,"We have presented DISk, an unsupervised skill discovery method that takes the first steps towards
learning skills incrementally. Although already powerful, we still have significant scope for future
work before such methods can be applied in real-world settings. For instance, we notice that on easy
tasks such as HalfCheetah, DISk underforms prior works, which is partly due to its inability to share
parameters from previously learned skills. Sharing parameters efficiently can allow improved learning
and a reduction of the total parameters. Next, to measure similarity in states, we use a fixed projection
function. Being able to simultaneously learn this projection function is likely to further improve
performance. Also, we use a fixed schedule based on skill convergence to add new skills to our
repertoire. A more intelligent schedule for skill addition would help DISk be even more optimized.
Finally, to apply such skill discovery methods in the real-world, we may have to bootstrap from
supervised data or demonstrations. Such bootstrapping can provide an enormous boost in settings
where humans can interact with the agent."

REFERENCES,0.5571095571095571,"On-policy RL (Schulman et al., 2015; Kakade, 2002; Williams, 1992) optimizes π by iterating
between data collection and policy updates. It hence requires new on-policy data every iteration,
which is expensive to obtain. On the other hand, off-policy reinforcement learning retains past
experiences in a replay buffer and is able to re-use past samples. Thus, in practice, off-policy
algorithms have been found to achieve better sample efficiency (Lillicrap et al., 2015; Haarnoja et al.,
2018). For our experiments we use SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018) as our base RL optimizer due to its
implicit maximization of action distribution entropy, sample efficiency, and fair comparisons with
baselines that also build on top of SAC. However, we note that our framework is compatible with any
standard off-policy RL algorithm that maximizes the entropy of the action distribution π(·) either
implicitly or explicitly."
REFERENCES,0.5594405594405595,"Soft Actor-Critic
The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al., 2018) is an off-policy model-free
RL algorithm that instantiates an actor-critic framework by learning a state-action value function Qθ, a
stochastic policy πθ and a temperature α over a discounted infinite-horizon MDP (X, A, P, R, γ, d0)
by optimizing a γ-discounted maximum-entropy objective (Ziebart et al., 2008). With a slight abuse
of notation, we define both the actor and critic learnable parameters by θ. SAC parametrizes the actor
policy πθ(at|xt) via a tanh-Gaussian defined as at = tanh(µθ(xt)+σθ(xt)ϵ), where ϵ ∼N(0, 1),
µθ and σθ are parametric mean and standard deviation. The SAC’s critic Qθ(xt, at) is parametrized
as an MLP neural network."

LEARNING SCHEDULE FOR ANT-V3 ON DISK"

example, the first two skills learned how to sit in place, and flip over. On the other hand, later skills
which just learns how to move in a different direction could reuse much of the replay buffers of the
earlier, complex skills which learned to move, and thus they did not need as many training steps
as the earlier complex skills. As a result, they converged at different speed. A schedule that most
closely fits this uneven convergence time is what we used: 5 000 000 environment steps unevenly
between the skills, with the skills getting 250 000, 250 000, 1 000 000, 1 000 000, 500 000, 500 000,

VALOR-LIKE INCREMENTAL SCHEDULE FOR BASELINES"
REFERENCES,0.8974358974358975,"In VALOR(Achiam et al., 2018), to stabilize training options based on a variational objective, the
authors present an curriculum training method where the latents were sampled from a small initial
distribution, and this distribution was extended every time the information theoretic objective was
saturated. More concretely, if c is a variable signifying the option latent and τ a trajectory generated
by it, then every time their discriminator reached E[Pdiscrim(c | τ)] = pD, where pD is a set constant
≈0.86, they expanded the set of option latents. If there were K latents when the objective saturates,
it was updated using the following formula:"

this experiments on top of the disjoint DIAYN (Sec. G.3) baseline and searched over possible pD

the pD values from the set {

6 ≤n ≤8, or pD ∈[0.83, 0.87], which lines up with the findings in the VALOR paper."

scheduling to DIAYN performs better than vanilla DIAYN with shared weights, but may actually
result in more degenerate skills than Disjoint-DIAYN. We hypothesize this may be caused by the
arbitrary nature of the threshold E[Pdiscrim(c | τ)], which is also mentioned by Achiam et al. (2018)."

skill that was not available at the beginning, unlike vanilla DIAYN. However, we believe because of
the downsides of curriculum scheduling, it also results in a lot of “dead” skills, which slow down the
addition of new skills, which results in few useful skills overall."
