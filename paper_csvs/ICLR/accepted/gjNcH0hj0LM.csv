ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0029069767441860465,"Time-series data are ubiquitous these days, but lack of the labels in time-series
data is regarded as a hurdle for its broad applicability. Meanwhile, active learn-
ing has been successfully adopted to reduce the labeling efforts in various tasks.
Thus, this paper addresses an important issue, time-series active learning. Inspired
by the temporal coherence in time-series data, where consecutive data points tend
to have the same label, our label propagation framework, called TCLP, automat-
ically assigns a queried label to the data points within an accurately estimated
time-series segment, thereby signiﬁcantly boosting the impact of an individual
query. Compared with traditional time-series active learning, TCLP is shown to
improve the classiﬁcation accuracy by up to 7.1 times when only 0.8% of data
points in the entire time series are queried for their labels."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.00872093023255814,"A time series is a sequence of data points at successive timestamps. Supervised learning (e.g., clas-
siﬁcation) with a time series requires the label of every data point, but unfortunately labels are often
missing and hard to obtain due to lack of domain-speciﬁc knowledge (Shen et al., 2018; Malhotra
et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). It is worse for a time series collected for an extended length of time, as
manually labeling so many data points is labor-intensive and time-consuming (Perslev et al., 2019;
Tonekaboni et al., 2021). Active learning (Settles, 2009), a method that iteratively selects the most
informative data point and queries a user for its label, can mitigate the high labeling cost. However,
most active learning methods are not geared for time-series data, as they assume that data points are
independent of one other (Sener & Savarese, 2018; Yoo & Kweon, 2019; Ash et al., 2020), which is
obviously not true in time-series data."
INTRODUCTION,0.011627906976744186,"Time-series data typically has the characteristic of temporal coherence; that is, temporally consecu-
tive data points tend to have the same label (Wang et al., 2020; Barrow et al., 2020; Ishikawa et al.,
2021). Let us refer to a sub-sequence of temporally coherent data points as a segment. For exam-
ple, in motion-sensing time-series data, a segment consists of data points with the same motion
status (e.g., walking, running). This temporal coherence of a segment can be exploited in time-series
active learning. Speciﬁcally, when the label of a certain data point is obtained from a user, the same
label can be propagated to other data points in the same segment. One challenge here is that the seg-
ment length is not known but needs to be estimated. If it is too short, unnecessarily frequent queries
are issued; if too long, data points on the fringe of the segment are labeled incorrectly, consequently
damaging the learning performance (e.g., classiﬁcation accuracy). Thus, accurate estimation of the
segments is important to enable the label propagation to achieve the maximum learning performance
with the minimum number of queries."
INTRODUCTION,0.014534883720930232,"This paper addresses the label propagation segment estimation problem in time-series active learn-
ing through a novel framework called Temporal Coherence-based Label Propagation (TCLP). Fig-
ure 1 illustrates the overall workﬂow in the time-series active learning centered on TCLP. TCLP
receives the class probabilities (i.e., softmax output) for the label of each data point from a classiﬁer
model and estimates the extent of the segment to propagate the label. This estimation is challenging"

INTRODUCTION,0.046511627906976744,"in a real time series, as the classiﬁer model output is uncertain and the time-series segments are
unknown. TCLP meets this challenge by taking advantage of the temporal coherence via a quadratic
plateau model (Moltisanti et al., 2019), by ﬁtting it to the classiﬁer model output to smooth out the
ﬂuctuations of class probabilities across consecutive data points."
INTRODUCTION,0.04941860465116279,"To the best of our knowledge, TCLP is the ﬁrst that performs label propagation for time-series
active learning. The previous work closest to ours is pseudo-labeling in single-timestamp supervised
learning, where labels are known for at least one data point in each segment (Moltisanti et al., 2019;
Ma et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). The approximate location and true class of a segment must be known
in their work, which is often impractical in the real world. Moreover, the known labels are relatively
dense in single-timestamp supervised learning, but they are very sparse in active learning—typically,
no more than 5% of segments in our experiments. Thus, ﬁnding the boundaries between segments
is more challenging in active learning than in single-timestamp supervised learning. To cope with
the sparsity of labeled data points, TCLP performs sparsity-aware label propagation by exploiting
temperature scaling (Guo et al., 2017) and plateau regularization."
INTRODUCTION,0.05232558139534884,Contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
INTRODUCTION,0.055232558139534885,"• It proposes a novel time-series active learning framework equipped with a sparsity-aware label
propagation within an accurately estimated segment.
• It veriﬁes the merit of TCLP through extensive experiments. The classiﬁcation accuracy is im-
proved by up to 7.1 times with TCLP compared to without label propagation. Moreover, TCLP
works with any query selection strategy including core-set sampling (Sener & Savarese, 2018)
and BADGE (Ash et al., 2020), boosting the effect of individual labeling."

ACTIVE LEARNING"
ACTIVE LEARNING,0.06395348837209303,"Active learning is a special case of machine learning that ‘actively’ queries a user for the labels of
data points, to the effect of using fewer labels to achieve the same learning performance. Recent
studies have focused on developing such query strategies for machine learning based on deep neural
networks (Settles, 2009; Ren et al., 2020). These approaches exploit prediction probabilities (Beluch
et al., 2018), embeddings (Sener & Savarese, 2018), gradients (Ash et al., 2020), and losses (Yoo
& Kweon, 2019) from deep neural networks to estimate the impact of each unlabeled data point
if it were to be labeled. However, these methods are not suitable for time-series data, because they
assume that data points are independent."
ACTIVE LEARNING,0.06686046511627906,"Several methods have been developed for time-series or sequence data, but most of them are applica-
ble to only segmented time-series data under the assumption that a time series is already divided into
labeled and unlabeled segments. Treating these segments as independent and identically distributed,
these methods simply apply existing active learning frameworks to the segments. For example, He
et al. (2015) select unlabeled segments that are far from labeled segments to maximize diversity;
Peng et al. (2017) select unlabeled segments with distinctive patterns to maximize diversity; and
Zhang et al. (2017) select unlabeled segments with high gradients to consider uncertainty for sen-
tence classiﬁcation. In addition, new neural network architectures or measures have been developed
for sequence-data applications such as named entity recognition (Shen et al., 2018), video action
recognition (Wang et al., 2018), and speech recognition (Malhotra et al., 2019). None of these meth-
ods is applicable to our problem, which handles unsegmented time-series data."

Pseudo-labeling has been actively studied for label-deﬁcient learning environments, such as semi-
supervised learning, to exploit unlabeled data points in training a classiﬁer (Lee et al., 2013). In"

PSEUDO-LABELING,0.0755813953488372,"general, a pseudo-label is given to an unlabeled data point based on the predictions from a classiﬁer
trained with labeled data points. Conﬁdence-based methods create a pseudo-label if it is conﬁdently
predicted by a classiﬁer (Lee et al., 2013). Consistency-based methods create a pseudo-label if it is
consistently predicted for the original and augmented data points (Sajjadi et al., 2016; Rizve et al.,
2021). Graph-based methods propagate pseudo-labels from labeled data points (nodes) to unlabeled
data points based on a similarity graph constructed from the features of all data points (Shi et al.,
2018; Liu et al., 2019; Wagner et al., 2018). However, these methods are not designed for time-series
data, and therefore are not directly applicable to our problem."
PSEUDO-LABELING,0.07848837209302326,"Coherence-based methods are developed for single-timestamp supervised learning for unsegmented
time-series data; they assume that at least one data point in each segment is given a true class label
through weak-supervision. Ma et al. (2020) propose probability thresholding propagation (PTP),
which propagates known labels bidirectionally unless the predicted class probability for each data
point is decreased by more than a threshold. Deldari et al. (2021) propose embedding similarity
propagation (ESP), which propagates known labels bidirectionally unless the embedding of each
data point changes rapidly. Recently, Moltisanti et al. (2019) adopt a plateau model that represents
class probabilities across consecutive data points, where a plateau model is constructed for each
labeled data point and ﬁtted to the classiﬁer output; a known label is propagated as long as the value
of a plateau model is higher than a threshold. While this work shares the idea of using a plateau
model with our work, using the plateau model as it is for active learning results in performance
degradation owing to the difference in the density of known labels, as will be shown in Section 4."

that simply optimizing the plateau model as explained in Section 3.2.1 tends to generate plateaus
much longer than true segments. See Section 4.4 for the poor performance of the typical (sparsity-
unaware) plateau model. On the other hand, in single-timestamp supervised learning, where the
plateau model has been successfully employed (Moltisanti et al., 2019), at least one label should
exist for every segment; thus, the boundaries of segments can be easily recognized while making
the plateaus not overlap between segments. Thus, to overcome the lack of potential boundaries for

OVERALL ACTIVE LEARNING PROCEDURE WITH TCLP,0.2877906976744186,"Algorithm 1 summarizes how TCLP works in time-series active learning. First, plateau models are
initialized with the initially labeled set DL and stored in the set H0 (Line 1); and then using DL,
TCLP trains the classiﬁer model fθ0 (Line 2). Then, at each active learning round r, TCLP ﬁrst per-
forms calibration by inferring the data points with the classiﬁer model fθr and scaling the softmax
output, and then initializes a new set of plateau models Hr (Line 4). Next, each plateau model in
Hr−1 from the previous round is ﬁtted to the scaled output, and then the updated plateau model
is added to Hr (Line 6). The new plateau models are then initialized from queried timestamp la-
bels (Line 7) and added to Hr (Line 8). Then, any overlapping plateaus in Hr are adjusted—either
merged into one or reduced to avoid the overlap—as needed (Line 9). Finally, the queried labels are
propagated following the plateau models in Hr (Line 10), and the classiﬁer model fθr is re-trained
with the augmented labeled set DL (Line 11). The complexity analysis of TCLP is presented in
Appendix A."

EXPERIMENT SETTING,0.36046511627906974,"Query selection methods: To evaluate the efﬁcacy of TCLP, we combine it with six different query
selection methods. CONF (Wang & Shang, 2014) selects b timestamps exhibiting the lowest con-
ﬁdence in the model’s prediction, where the conﬁdence is evaluated by using the largest predicted
class probability; MARG (Settles, 2012) is similar to CONF, but it deﬁnes the conﬁdence as the
difference between the ﬁrst- and second-largest predicted class probabilities; ENTROPY (Wang &
Shang, 2014) selects the top b timestamps exhibiting the largest entropy for their predicted class
probabilities; CS (Sener & Savarese, 2018) chooses the top b most representative timestamps in em-
bedding space; BADGE (Ash et al., 2020) computes gradients from fθ at each timestamp t and
queries b timestamps found by k-MEANS++ to consider uncertainty and diversity; UTILITY is our
simple selection strategy that selects b timestamps randomly from the timestamps not covered by
the current set of plateau models, to increase the utility of the plateau models."
EXPERIMENT SETTING,0.3633720930232558,"Compared label propagation methods: For a thorough comparison, we compare TCLP with three
available label propagation approaches—NOP, PTP, and ESP. For this purpose, each of TCLP and
the three approaches is combined with each of the aforementioned six query selection methods. NOP
is the baseline without using any label propagation. As explained in Section 2.2, PTP propagates
labels based on the predicted class probabilities with a certain threshold (δ = 0.8), while ESP
leverages cosine similarity between embeddings for label propagation. PTP and ESP are modiﬁed
to work in an active learning setting as done by Deldari et al. (2021)."
EXPERIMENT SETTING,0.36627906976744184,"TCLP implementation details: We use the multi-stage temporal convolutional network (MS-
TCN) (Farha & Gall, 2019) as the classiﬁer fθ for time-series data. We use exactly the same training
conﬁguration suggested in the original work (Farha & Gall, 2019). Regarding active learning hy-
perparameters, the number of queried data points per round (b) and the number of active learning
rounds (R) are summarized in Table 1. For TCLP, we use the initial parameters for plateau mod-
els (w0 and s0) in Table 1 and temperature scaling with T = 2. Our experience indicates that any
value of w0 smaller than 20% of the mean segment length is adequate enough. Accuracy met-
rics: Timestamp accuracy and segmental F1 score are measured at each round by ﬁve-fold cross
validation; they represent the prediction accuracy at the granularity of timestamp and segment, re-
spectively. The former is deﬁned as the proportion of the timestamps with correct prediction. The
latter is deﬁned as the F1 score of segments with an overlapping threshold on the intersection over
union (IoU) (Farha & Gall, 2019); that is, a prediction is classiﬁed as correct if the IoU between pre-
dicted and true segments is larger than the threshold. F1@25, with the threshold 25%, is commonly
used in the literature (Lea et al., 2017; Farha & Gall, 2019); the trends with the thresholds 10% and
50% are similar."

OVERALL ACTIVE LEARNING PERFORMANCE,0.39825581395348836,"Figure 4 shows the F1@25 and timestamp accuracy at each round of varying the queried data ra-
tio (= the number of queried data points / the total number of data points), where the accuracy values
are averaged over the six query selection methods. 15 rounds are conducted for each dataset. TCLP
performs the best among all label propagation approaches, with the accuracy improving much faster
with a smaller number of queries than in the other approaches; this performance is attributed to the
larger number of correctly propagated labels in TCLP, as will be shown in Section 4.3. Interestingly,
the accuracy gain is higher in F1@25 than in timestamp accuracy; this difference makes sense be-
cause F1@25 measures the accuracy at the granularity of segment and therefore reﬂects temporal
coherence better than the granularity of timestamp. Appendix D shows more details."
OVERALL ACTIVE LEARNING PERFORMANCE,0.4011627906976744,"Table 2 shows the F1@25 and timestamp accuracy measured after the ﬁnal (15th) round, i.e., at
the last queried data ratio in Figure 4, for each of the six query selection methods. TCLP performs
best here as well in almost all combinations of datasets, query selection methods, and accuracy
metrics. Speciﬁcally, TCLP outperforms the compared label propagation approaches (NOP, PTP,
and ESP) for all query selection methods except only a few cases. This result conﬁrms that TCLP
maintains its performance advantage regardless of the query selection method. Interestingly, TCLP’s
performance gain is most outstanding for the mHealth dataset and least outstanding for the GTEA
dataset. The reason lies in the length of the segments. As shown in Table 1, mHealth’s segments are
the longest (2,933 on average) and GTEA’s segments are the shortest (34 on average). Longer seg-
ments certainly allow more temporal coherence to be exploited in label propagation, thus resulting
in higher performance. For instance, using UTILITY on the mHealth dataset, TCLP outperforms
NOP by 7.1 times, PTP by 1.2 times, and ESP by 1.2 times in F1@25 while, on the GTEA dataset,
TCLP outperforms them less signiﬁcantly."

EFFECTS OF SPARSITY-AWARE LABEL PROPAGATION TECHNIQUES IN TCLP"
EFFECTS OF SPARSITY-AWARE LABEL PROPAGATION TECHNIQUES IN TCLP,0.45348837209302323,"Table 4 shows the timestamp accuracy achieved by TCLP with and without two techniques em-
ployed to handle sparsity of labels—temperature scaling for classiﬁer output calibration and plateau
width regularization in Section 3.2.2. The class skewness balancing is employed by default to assure
stable performance. In addition, the temperature scale factor T is varied for the temperature scal-
ing technique. Compared with enabling both width regularization and temperature scaling (T = 2),
removing width regularization only, temperature scaling only, and both degrades the timestamp ac-
curacy by 5.0%, 4.3%, and 7.6%, respectively, in the 50salads dataset and 4.8%. 4.2%, and 8.1%,
respectively, in the GTEA dataset. Clearly, both techniques are helpful for the label propagation,
with the width regularization showing higher effect than the temperature scaling. Note that when
T > 2, the label propagation length is suppressed, thereby causing deﬁciency in labels needed to
train a classiﬁer; when T < 1, the label propagation length may exceed the true segment length,
thereby including wrong labels when training the classiﬁer. The break point is affected by the av-
erage length of segments in each dataset, where it occurs at a higher value of T in a dataset with
shorter segments: the average segment length is 34 in the GTEA dataset whereas it is 289 in the
50salads dataset."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.45930232558139533,"In this paper, we present a novel label propagation framework for time-series active learning, TCLP,
that fully takes advantage of the temporal coherence inherent in time-series data. The temporal co-
herence is modeled by the quadratic plateau model, which plays a key role in segment estimation.
Furthermore, the sparsity of known labels is relieved using temperature scaling and plateau reg-
ularization. Thanks to accurate and effective label propagation, TCLP enables us to improve the
performance of time-series supervised learning with much smaller labeling effort. Extensive experi-
ments with various datasets show that TCLP improves the classiﬁcation accuracy by up to 7.1 times
when only 0.8% of data points are queried for their labels. Future work includes developing a query
selection strategy that maximizes the merit of label propagation and utilizing a constraint on plateau
model ﬁtting based on similarity among plateau models with the same class. Overall, we expect that
our work will contribute greatly to various applications whose labeling cost is expensive."

COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF TCLP"
REFERENCES,0.6191860465116279,"In each round of active learning, let M be the number of plateau models, V be the average length
of sub-sequences of predicted probability fθ(xt)[k], and S be the number of training steps for eval-
uating Equation (4). Then, considering constant computational complexity for calculating the loss
and gradient at each timestamp in the sub-sequences, we derive the computational complexity of
plateau model ﬁtting per round to be O(MV S). Here, M can be reduced by merging two overlap-
ping plateau models with the same class. This complexity of ﬁtting the plateau models is negligible
compared with the complexity of training the classiﬁer. For instance, according to the experiment
for the 50salads dataset conducted using Intel Xeon Gold 6226R and Nvidia RTX3080, ﬁtting the
plateau models took only about 1 to 2 minutes, whereas training the classiﬁer took about half an
hour per active learning round."

ADJUSTMENT OF OVERLAPPING PLATEAUS IN TCLP"
REFERENCES,0.6656976744186046,"The process of adjusting overlapping updated plateaus through either merge or reduction is as fol-
lows. Consider two plateaus hkl(cl, wl, sl) (on the left) and hkr(cr, wr, sr) (on he right), where
(cl−wl <cr−wr) ∧(cl+wl >cr−wr) ∧(cl+wl <cr+wr) holds. If the classes assigned to these
two plateaus are the same, i.e., kl = kr, then they are merged to become one plateau whose width
covers the segment merged from the two plateaus’ segments. Hence, the half-width w′ and center
c′ of the new plateau are w′ = (cr + wr −cl + wl)/2 and c′ = cl −wl + w′, respectively. If, on
the other hand, different classes are assigned to the two plateaus, i.e., kl ̸= kr, their half-widths are
reduced to remove any overlap between them. As a result, separating the two plateaus at the mid-
point m(= (cl + cr)/2) between their centers, after the reduction the left plateau has the half-width
w′
l = (m −(cl −wl))/2 and the center at c′
l = cl −wl + w′
l, and the right plateau has the half-width
w′
r = (cr + wr −m)/2 and the center c′
r = cr + wr −w′
r. Note that the labels of queried data
points should not change as a result of this reduction. If the right plateau covers multiple queried
data points whose timestamps are smaller than cr, the timestamp of the leftmost queried data point
becomes a new cr. The same is applicable to the left plateau, except the change of the direction."
