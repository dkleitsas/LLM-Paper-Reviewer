ABSTRACT,0.0029940119760479044,"Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple input
images acquired through various sources to synthesize a new fused image. Existing
methods usually employ distinct constraint designs tailored to specific scenes,
forming fixed fusion paradigms. However, this data-driven fusion approach is
challenging to deploy in varying scenarios, especially in rapidly changing environ-
ments. To address this issue, we propose a conditional controllable fusion (CCF)
framework for general image fusion tasks without specific training. Due to the
dynamic differences of different samples, our CCF employs specific fusion con-
straints for each individual in practice. Given the powerful generative capabilities
of the denoising diffusion model, we first inject the specific constraints into the
pre-trained DDPM as adaptive fusion conditions. The appropriate conditions are
dynamically selected to ensure the fusion process remains responsive to the specific
requirements in each reverse diffusion stage. Thus, CCF enables conditionally
calibrating the fused images step by step. Extensive experiments validate our
effectiveness in general fusion tasks across diverse scenarios against the competing
methods without additional training. The code is publicly available.†"

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.008982035928143712,"Image fusion aims at integrating complementary information from multi-source images, fusing a
new composite image containing richer details [1]. It has been applied in various scenarios that
single image contains incomplete information, such as multi-modal fusion (MMF) [2, 3], multi-
exposure fusion (MEF) [4, 5], multi-focus fusion (MFF) [6], and remote sensing fusion [2]. The
fused image inherits the strengths of both modalities, resulting in a composite with enhanced visual
effects [7]. These fusion tasks have diverse downstream applications in computer vision, including
object detection [8–10], semantic segmentation [11, 12], and medical diagnosis [13] because the
comprehensive representation of images with multi-scene information contributes to the improved
performance of applications."
INTRODUCTION,0.011976047904191617,"Recently, numerous image fusion methods [14–17] have been proposed, such as traditional fusion
methods [18], CNN-based fusion methods [19, 20] and GAN-based methods [21]. While these
methods produce acceptable fused images in certain scenarios, they are also accompanied by sig-
nificant drawbacks and limitations: (i) They are often tailored for specific scenarios or individual
tasks, limiting their adaptability across diverse applications; (ii) These methods necessitate training
and consume substantial computational resources, posing limitations in terms of time and resource
requirements. Lately, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) have emerged as an iterative"

The distinct process of sampling has different favor of the conditions. The crucial role that diverse
conditions play in controlling various image generation processes. Throughout the diffusion sampling,

numerous researchers explored its controllable aspects. ILVR [22] proposed iterative latent variable
refinement with a reference image to control image translation. Some recent works [23, 24] employed
the diffusion model for image fusion, which fuses images in fixed fusion paradigms (fixed fusion
conditions) by using its inherent reconstruction capacity. However, these approaches are not qualified
for sample-customized fusion with dynamic conditions. At present, general image fusion with
controllable diffusion models is still a challenging problem, warranting further exploration."
INTRODUCTION,0.05688622754491018,"In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based controllable conditional image fusion (CCF) framework,
which controls the fusion process by adaptively selecting optimization conditions. We construct a
condition bank of generally used conditions, categorizing them into basic, enhanced, and task-specific
conditions. CCF dynamically assigns fusion conditions from the condition bank and continuously
injects them into the sampling process of diffusion. To enable flexible integrated conditions, we
further propose a sampling-adaptive condition selection (SCS) mechanism that tailors condition
selection at different denoising steps. The iterative refinements of the sampling are based on the
pre-trained diffusion model without additional training. It is worth noting that the estimated fused
images are conditionally controllable during the iterative denoising process. The diffusion process
seamlessly integrates these conditions during the sampling process, decreasing potential impacts. As
illustrated in Fig. 1, the generation process emphasizes different aspects at various sampling steps.
In the initial stages, the condition selection is influenced by random noise, resulting in a random
selection. During the intermediate stages, there is a shift towards content components. In the final
stage, the emphasis moves to generating and selecting texture details. These various conditional
factors contribute to different aspects of fusion results and demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness
of introducing specific conditions in different stages. To the best of our knowledge, we for the first
time propose a conditional controllable framework for image fusion. The main contributions are
summarized as follows:"

Condition Bank"
CONDITION BANK,0.24850299401197604,"We empirically construct a condition bank and divide the image constraints into three categories:
basic fusion conditions, enhanced fusion conditions, and task-specific fusion conditions. Basic fusion
conditions are utilized throughout the entire sampling process, while enhanced fusion conditions
are dynamically selected. Task-specific fusion conditions are manually optional, tailored to specific
tasks, and may possess unique attributes that can be customized for various task scenarios. All
conditions can be part of the enhanced condition set, enabling dynamic selection. The condition bank
presented in this paper includes some common conditions, but additional conditions can be explored
and utilized in other scenarios."
CONDITION BANK,0.25149700598802394,"In the above formulation, each conditional Markov transition with the given condition c is shown
in Eq. 5. In particular, we constructed a condition bank that allows us to select required conditions
C = {c1, c2, ..., cn}, subsequently integrating them into the unconditional DDPM for executing
conditional image fusion. Let C represent a condition bank comprising a series of conditions. The
function δC represents the difference between the source images with the given condition. In every
sampling step t, the difference function δci can be minimized using gradient descent. These conditions
help regulate the image information within each modality involved in the fusion process."
CONDITION BANK,0.25449101796407186,"Basic Conditions. As shown in Fig. 2, basic conditions are essential to select for a basic generation.
The basic conditions aim to synthesize a foundational fused image, offering an initial, coarse
representation. The fused image serves as a primary fusion output, capturing essential features from
the source images, though it may suffer from detail loss or texture blur. Notably, different scenarios
may require adjustments to the basic condition, as the specific requirements of each fusion task, such
as clarity, contrast, and other priorities, can influence its selection. Tailoring the basic condition to
align with the unique demands of each task thus ensures an effective fusion process."
CONDITION BANK,0.25748502994011974,"Enhanced Conditions. Besides basic conditions, we added enhancement conditions for refining the
image generation process. The condition bank contains a variety of enhanced conditions, inspired
by various Image Quality Assessments (IQA) such as SSIM, and standard deviation(SD). These
conditions can be integrated into the CCF generation process to improve the quality of the generated
images. The enhanced conditions can be selected with SCS algorithm, allowing different steps of the
diffusion sampling process to be optimized with different conditions. This targeted approach ensures"
CONDITION BANK,0.26047904191616766,"that each phase of the image generation is adapted to the specific requirements of that stage, resulting
in higher quality fused images."
CONDITION BANK,0.2634730538922156,"Task-specific Conditions. The purpose of image fusion is to facilitate various downstream tasks. To
meet the specific requirements of these tasks, we offer task-specific conditions. These conditions can
be manually added to ensure that the fusion process is tailored to suit the downstream applications
better. For example, a detection condition can be introduced by utilizing the feature extracted by
a detection network F = D(x). The detection condition is formulated as ||F(x), F(M)||2, where
X ∈{x0}m
i and M is the set of m modalities. Other task-specific conditions can be similarly tailored
to optimize the fusion process for different tasks. By integrating these task-specific conditions, the
image fusion process can be precisely aligned with the demands of various applications, enhancing
the effectiveness and utility of the generated images."

SAMPLING-ADAPTIVE CONDITION SELECTION,0.2694610778443114,"During the diffusion sampling process, it is crucial to focus on generating distinct aspects of the
image. To address this, we designed an algorithm that dynamically selects the appropriate condition
from the condition bank to fit each sampling stage. This selection process can be denoted as
Copt = Topk{Gate(C)}. The Copt is the selected condition, and Gate is the gate of selection. We
hypothesize that rapidly changing conditions during the sampling process should be prioritized as
they indicate greater significance at that generation stage. Inspired by multi-task learning [40], the
gate of conditions can be calculated using the following formula:
Gate = [ω1, ..ωc], ωi(t) = ωi(t −1) −▽ωi.

EVALUATION ON MULTI-MODAL IMAGE FUSION,0.32934131736526945,"Quantitative Comparisons. We em-
ploy five quantitative metrics to eval-
uate our model, as shown in Ta-
ble 1. Our method demonstrated ex-
ceptional performance across various
evaluation metrics.
On the LLVIP
dataset, our method achieved the best
results in SSIM, MSE, and CC indica-
tors. Specifically, our method outper-
formed others in SSIM and CC, with
improvements of 0.02 and 0.035 over
the second-best results, respectively.
Additionally, lower MSE values indi-
cate better performance, with our method showing a reduction of 362 compared to the second-best
methods in these metrics. This indicates that our method retains more information from the source
images. The results show suboptimal performance in Nabf but are close to the best values, indicating
the fused image with less noise. Notably, our method does not necessitate turning and holds its
ground against methods requiring training. Compared to existing LLM tuning methods, our model
performs slightly worse in terms of PSNR. This demonstrates the excellent performance of our model,
achieving high performance across almost all indicators in a tuning-free model."

conditions enables effective preservation of the background and texture. This comparison underscores
our model’s efficacy in image fusion, resulting in outstanding visual outcomes. As shown in Fig. 3,
our method showcases superior visual quality compared to other approaches. Specifically, our method
excels in preserving intricate texture details well lid in low light (Fig. 3 red box). Although TC-MoA
and MUFusion approach our method in retaining details, they exhibit visible artifacts, blur, and low
contrast—characteristics absent in CCF (Fig. 3, green box). CCF exhibits the highest contrast, the
clearest details, and the most information content, further highlighting its superiority in preserving
texture details. Its excellent detail retention and clear background generation further demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method."

visual performance, particularly in preserving intricate details. We have carefully selected specific
conditions that allow our approach to effectively handle the blurring caused by multi-focus scenes
while retaining the original image’s lighting and color information. In comparison, other DDPM-
based methods such as DDFM are unable to achieve the same level of effectiveness as our approach.
In Fig. 4 (red), our method excels in preserving the details of the watch hand. The closest result to
ours is U2Fusion, but it loses texture and color fidelity, appearing blurry, in Fig. 4 (green). In short,
our method performs well in maintaining both color and authentic details."

the MEF index, analogous to the results observed for the MFF task. Notably, the metrics SD, AG,
and SF signify the highest image quality, while SCD exhibits the highest correlation. Each of these
metrics attained state-of-the-art performance levels, underscoring the efficacy of our approach. This
consistent performance across multiple metrics illustrates the robustness and versatility of our method

EVALUATION ON MULTI-EXPOSURE FUSION,0.36826347305389223,"Qualitative Comparisons. Fig. 4 demonstrates the excellent visual performance of our method.
Our approach effectively addresses the issue of overexposure while preserving crucial details. In
contrast, DDFM, which relies on finding the middle value of two images, struggles to maintain texture
details. Similarly, Text-IF tends to result in higher average brightness, which can lead to content
loss in overexposed scenes. Defusion and TC-MoA exhibit similar visual performance, with more
blurred edges compared to our method. In comparison, our method strikes a balance between these
challenges, resulting in superior visual fidelity and saturation compared to other existing methods."

injected together without SCS, the metrics all reduced (Fig. 6(b)), likely due to the conflict between
different conditions, as evidenced by the messy lines and random noise in Fig. 6(d). This demonstrates
that injecting conditions unevenly without DCS leads to suboptimal results. After introducing DCS,
both the metrics and visual results (Fig. 6(e)) are well-balanced, with conditions being injected as
needed during the generation process. This indicates the effectiveness of the condition bank and DCS
in dynamically and appropriately selecting the conditions."

DISCUSSION ON CONTROLLABLE FUSION,0.41317365269461076,"4T to T steps). SSIM also remains selected to
constrain the structure, whereas the frequency of SD selection decreases. This demonstrates the
crucial role of dynamically selecting conditions during the diffusion sampling process. Our CCF
adaptively decomposes diverse conflict fusion conditions into different denoising steps, which is
significantly compatible with the reconstruction preferences of different steps in the denoising model.
This dynamic fusion paradigm ensures appropriate condition selection at each stage of the sampling."

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.41916167664670656,"In this paper, we introduce a learning-free approach for conditional controllable image fusion (CCF),
utilizing a condition bank to regulate joint information with a pre-trained DDPM. We capitalize
on the remarkable reconstruction abilities of DDPM and integrate them into the sampling steps.
Sample-adaptive condition selection facilitates fusion in dynamic scenarios. Varied fusion images
can personalize their conditions to emphasize different aspects. Empirical findings demonstrate that
CCF surpasses the competing methods in achieving superior performance for general image fusion
tasks. In the future, we will further explore automatic manners to distinguish basic and enhanced
conditions to reduce empirical intervention, thereby enabling more robust and reliable image fusion."

where cMSE can be expressed as ||MSE(i, x0) + MSE(v, x0)||. In contrast, for the MEF and MFF

model as the detection condition. In our experiments, we employ YOLOv5, which is pretrained
on the visible modality, to extract features from both the estimated x0 at each step and the visible
image. The Euclidean distance is minimized in the inverse diffusion process iteratively. Consequently,
the final fused image progressively integrates the object-specific information, enhancing the fusion
performance. We provide additional visualizations of the detection conditions, as shown in Fig. 10,
directly fused images appear to have a lot of missed detection in raw 1-4 and the detection scores are
generally higher. The last row of Fig.10 demonstrates a reduction in false-positive boxes when the

demonstrates advanced generalization with dynamic condition selection, there are still some potential
limitations. We provide a condition bank, but it needs to be constructed empirically. Most of
the conditions are inspired by Image Quality Assessment (IQA), but classifying these conditions
is challenging due to the complexity of IQA. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a method to
automatically classify the conditions, reducing empirical intervention. Additionally, our method relies
on a pre-trained diffusion model, which limits its efficiency and makes the generation process time-
consuming. Exploring more effective sampling processes would be valuable to improve efficiency

Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8473053892215568,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility"
CLAIMS,0.8592814371257484,"Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide implementation details in Sec. 5 and experimental setting in
App. A.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8622754491017964,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code"
CLAIMS,0.8652694610778443,"Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?"
CLAIMS,0.8682634730538922,"Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The source code is provided in https://github.com/jehovahxu/CCF.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8712574850299402,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details"
CLAIMS,0.874251497005988,"Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide all the implementation details in Sec. 5 and App. A.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8772455089820359,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.

material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance"
CLAIMS,0.8802395209580839,"Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: All the experiments and comparisons are performed with the same settings.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8832335329341318,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean."
CLAIMS,0.8862275449101796,"• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text."

BROADER IMPACTS,0.9401197604790419,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations."
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9431137724550899,"• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9461077844311377,11. Safeguards
SAFEGUARDS,0.9491017964071856,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?"
SAFEGUARDS,0.9520958083832335,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.9550898203592815,Justification: All the generated images are carefully checked.
SAFEGUARDS,0.9580838323353293,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9610778443113772,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
