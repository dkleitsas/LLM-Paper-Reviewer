ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.00273224043715847,"This paper tackles the problem of learning value functions from undirected state-
only experience (state transitions without action labels i.e. (s, s′, r) tuples). We
ﬁrst theoretically characterize the applicability of Q-learning in this setting. We
show that tabular Q-learning in discrete Markov decision processes (MDPs) learns
the same value function under any arbitrary reﬁnement of the action space. This
theoretical result motivates the design of Latent Action Q-learning or LAQ, an
ofﬂine RL method that can learn effective value functions from state-only experi-
ence. Latent Action Q-learning (LAQ) learns value functions using Q-learning on
discrete latent actions obtained through a latent-variable future prediction model.
We show that LAQ can recover value functions that have high correlation with
value functions learned using ground truth actions. Value functions learned using
LAQ lead to sample efﬁcient acquisition of goal-directed behavior, can be used
with domain-speciﬁc low-level controllers, and facilitate transfer across embod-
iments. Our experiments in 5 environments ranging from 2D grid world to 3D
visual navigation in realistic environments demonstrate the beneﬁts of LAQ over
simpler alternatives, imitation learning oracles, and competing methods."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.00819672131147541,"Ofﬂine or batch reinforcement learning focuses on learning goal-directed behavior from pre-
recorded data of undirected experience in the form of (st, at, st+1, rt) quadruples. However, in
many realistic applications, action information is not naturally available (e.g. when learning from
video demonstrations), or worse still, isn’t even well-deﬁned (e.g. when learning from the experi-
ence of an agent with a different embodiment). Motivated by such use cases, this paper studies if,
and how, intelligent behavior can be derived from undirected streams of observations: (st, st+1, rt).1"
INTRODUCTION,0.01092896174863388,"At the face of it, it might seem that observation-only data would be useless towards learning goal-
directed policies. After all, to learn such a policy, we need to know what actions to execute. Our
key conceptual insight is that while an observation-only dataset doesn’t tell us the precise action to
execute, i.e. the policy π(a|s); it may still tell us which states are more likely to lead us to the goal
than not, i.e. the value function V (s). For example, simply by looking at someone working in the
kitchen, we can infer that approaching the microwave handle is more useful (i.e. has higher value)
for opening the microwave than to approach the buttons. Thus, we can still make use of observation-
only data, if we focused on learning value functions as opposed to directly learning goal-directed
policies. Once we have learned a good value function, it can be used to quickly acquire or infer
behavior. Using learned value functions as dense rewards can lead to quick policy learning through
some small amount of interaction in the environment. Alternatively, they could be used to directly
guide the behavior of low-level controllers that may already be available for the agent (as is often
the case in robotics) without any further training. Furthermore, decoupling the learning of value
functions from policy learning enables deriving behavior for agents with a different embodiment as
long as the overall solution strategy remains similar. Thus, the central technical question is how to
learn a good value function from undirected observation streams. Is it even possible? If so, under
what conditions? This paper tackles these questions from a theoretical and practical perspective."

INTRODUCTION,0.01912568306010929,"We start out by characterizing the behavior of tabular Q-learning from Watkins (1989) under missing
action labels. We note that Q-learning with naively imputed action labels is equivalent to the TD(0)
policy evaluation, which serves as a simple baseline method for deriving a value function. However,
depending on the policy that generated the data, the learned values (without any action grounding)
can differ from the optimal values. Furthermore, it is possible to construct simple environments
where the behavior implied by the learned value function is also sub-optimal."
INTRODUCTION,0.02185792349726776,"Next, we present a more optimistic result. There are settings in which Q-learning can recover the
optimal value function even in the absence of the knowledge of underlying actions. Concretely, we
prove that if we are able to obtain an action space which is a strict reﬁnement of the original action
space, then Q-learning in this reﬁned action space recovers the optimal value function."
INTRODUCTION,0.02459016393442623,"This motivates a practical algorithm for learning value functions from the given undirected
observation-only experience. We design a latent-variable future prediction model that seeks to ob-
tain a reﬁned action space. It operates by predicting st+1 from st and a discrete latent variable ˆa
from a set of actions ˆA (Section 4.1). Training this latent variable model assigns a discrete action
ˆat to each (st, st+1) tuple. This allows us to employ Q-learning to learn good value functions (Sec-
tion 4.2). The learned value function is used to derive behavior (Section 4.3) either through some
online interaction with the environment, or through the use of domain speciﬁc low-level controllers."
INTRODUCTION,0.0273224043715847,"The use of a latent action space for Q-learning allows us to exceed the performance of methods
based on policy evaluation (Edwards & Isbell, 2019), which will learn the value of the demonstration
policy, not the optimal value function. Additionally, it side-steps the problem of reconstructing high-
dimensional images faced by other state-only value learning methods (Edwards et al., 2020). Other
approaches for learning from state-only data rely on imitating the demonstration data, which renders
them unable to improve on sub-optimal demonstration data. See Section 7 for more discussion."
INTRODUCTION,0.030054644808743168,"Our experiments in ﬁve environments (2D grid world, 2D continuous control, Atari game Freeway,
robotic manipulation, and visual navigation in realistic 3D environments) test our proposed ideas.
Our method approximates a reﬁnement of the latent space better than clustering alternatives, and
in turn, learns value functions highly correlated with ground truth. Good value functions in-turn
lead to sample efﬁcient acquisition of behavior, leading to signiﬁcant improvement over learning
with only environment rewards. Our method compares well against existing methods that learn
from undirected observation-only data, while being also applicable to the case of high-dimensional
observation spaces in the form of RGB images. We are also able to outperform imitation learning
methods, even when these imitation learning methods have access to privileged ground-truth action
information. Furthermore, our method is able to use observation-only experience from one agent to
speed up learning for another agent with a different embodiment."

p(s′, r|s, a) is the state/reward joint dynamics function. It speciﬁes the probability distribution that
the agent ends up in state s′, receives a reward of r on executing action a from state s."
PRELIMINARIES,0.03825136612021858,"Ofﬂine or batch RL (Lange et al., 2012; Levine et al., 2020) studies the problem of deriving high
reward behavior when only given a dataset of experience in an MDP, in the form of a collection of
quadruples (s, a, s′, r). In this paper, we tackle a harder version of this problem where instead we
are only given a collection of triplets (s, s′, r), i.e. experience without information about intervening
actions. In general, this dataset could contain any quality of behavior. In contrast to some methods
(see Section 7), we will not assume that demonstrations in the dataset are of high quality, and design
our method to be robust to sub-optimal data. Using such a dataset, our goal is to learn good value
functions. A value function under a policy π is a function of states that estimates the expected return
when starting in s and following π thereafter."
PRELIMINARIES,0.040983606557377046,"In this paper, we will focus on methods based on Q-learning (Watkins, 1989) for tackling this prob-

can be used to learn or improve a different policy for a different task. Q-learning seeks to learn the
optimal Q-function Q∗(s, a) by iteratively updating Q(st, at) to the Bellman equation. This process
converges to the Q∗under mild conditions in many settings (Watkins, 1989)."

learned value functions and the induced behavior, when conducting Q-learning with datasets with
different qualities of intervening actions. The agent needs to navigate from the top left of a 6 × 6
grid to the bottom right with sparse reward. We generate data from a ﬁxed, sub-optimal policy
to evaluate all methods in an ofﬂine fashion (additional details in Section A.7). We generate 20K
episodes with this policy, and obtain value functions using Q-learning under the following 4 choices
for the intervening actions: (1) Ground truth actions (Vgt), (2) One action (Vone-act, ammounts to
TD(0) policy evaluation), (3) 4× reﬁnement of original action space (V4×-gt). We modify the data so
that each sample for a particular action in the original action space is randomly mapped to one of 4
actions in the augmented space. (4) Obfuscated actions (Vimpure-act). Original action with probability
0.5, and a random action with probability 0.5."

recover the optimal value function, and recovers the value corresponding to the policy that generated
the data. Vimpure-act, under noise in action labels (non-reﬁnement) also fails to recover the optimal
value function. Furthermore, the behavior implied by Vimpure-act and Vone-act is sub-optimal. We also
analyze the effect of the action impurity on learned values and implied behavior. Behavior becomes
increasingly inaccurate as action impurity increases. More details in Section A.4."

us to compare different ways of arriving at the value function: other methods in the literature (D3G

these environments test our approach on different factors that make policy learning hard: continuous
control, high-dimensional observations and control, complex real world appearance, 3D geometric
reasoning, and learning across embodiments. Environments are visualized in Figure 3, more details
about the environments are provided in Section A.6."
D CONTINUOUS CONTROL,0.20491803278688525,"Experimental Setup For each setting, we work with a pre-collected dataset of experience in the
form of state, next state and reward triplets, (ot, ot+1, rt). We use our latent-variable forward model
(Section 4.1) and label triplets with latent actions to obtain quadruples (ot, ˆat, ot+1, r). We perform
Q-learning on these quadruples to obtain value functions V (s), which are used to acquire behaviors
either through densiﬁed RL by interacting with the environment, or through use of domains-speciﬁc
low-level controllers. We use the ACME codebase (Hoffman et al., 2020) for experiments."
D CONTINUOUS CONTROL,0.20765027322404372,"Latent Action Quality. In line with the theory developed in Section 3, we want to establish how
well our method learns a reﬁnement of the underlying action space. To assess this, we study the
state-conditioned purity of the partition induced by the learned latent actions (see deﬁnition in Sec-
tion A.9). Overall, our method is effective at ﬁnding reﬁnement of the original action space. It
achieves higher state-conditioned purity than a single action and clustering. In high-dimensional
image observation settings, it surpasses baselines by a wide margin. More details in Section A.9."

USING VALUE FUNCTIONS FOR DOWNSTREAM TASKS,0.2677595628415301,"• Using value functions as dense reward functions. We combine sparse task reward with the
learned value function as a potential function (Section 4.3). We scale up the sparse task rewards
by a factor of 5 so that behavior is dominated by the task reward once policy starts solving the
task. Figure 4 measures the learning sample efﬁciency. We compare to only using the sparse
reward, behavior cloning (BC) with ground truth actions, and BC followed by spare reward RL.
• Using value functions to learn behavior of an agent with a different embodiment. Decoupling
the learning of value function and the policy has the advantage that learned value functions can
be used to improve learning across embodiment. We demonstrate this, we keep the same task, but
change the embodiment of the agent in Maze2D and FrankaKitchen environments. Note that we
do not assume access to ground truth actions in these experiments either. For Maze2D, the point-
mass is replaced with a 8-DOF quadrupedal ant. For FrankaKitchen, the Franka arm is replaced
with a position-controlled hook. We may need to deﬁne how we query the value function when
the embodiment (and the underlying state space) changes. For the ant in Maze2D, the location
(with 0 velocity) of the ant body is used to query the value function learned with the point-mass.
For the hook in FrankaKitchen, the value function is able to transfer directly as both settings
observe end-effector position and environment state. We report results in Figure 5.
• Using value functions to guide low-level controllers. Learned value functions also have the
advantage that they can be used directly at test time to guide the behavior of low-level controllers.
We do this experiment in context of 3D visual navigation in a scan of a real building and use the
branching environment from Chang et al. (2020). We follow their setup and replace their value
functions with ones learned using LAQ in their hierarchical policy, and compare the efﬁciency of
behavior encoded by the different value functions."

followed by ﬁne-tuning with sparse rewards for environments where the experience is undirected

works well. A similar trend can be seen in the higher Spearman’s coefﬁcient for LAQ vs. Vone-act in
Table 1. LAQ discovers stronger behavior than imitation learning when faced with undirected data."

Learning as our ofﬂine value learning method, it is compatible with recent more advanced ofﬂine
RL value-learning methods (such as CQL (Kumar et al., 2020) and BCQ (Fujimoto et al., 2019)).
We validate by simply swaping to using (discrete) BCQ with our latent actions. Figures. 4 and 5
show that LAQ with BCQ is the strongest method, outperforming ours with DQN, and D3G, on
Maze2D and embodiment transfer environments.
Analysis of Spearman’s correlations in Table 2
shows the same trend as before with latent actions: better than single actions, and clustering variants.

D NAVIGATION TRANSFER TO ANT,0.3360655737704918,"LAQ compares favorably to D3G. We compare LAQ and D3G (a competing state-only method) in
different ways. D3G relies on generating potential future states. This is particularly challenging for
image observations, and D3G doesn’t show results with image observations. In contrast, LAQ maps
state transitions to discrete actions, and hence works with image observations as our experiments
show. Even in scenarios with low-dimensional state inputs, LAQ learns better value functions than
D3G, as evidences by Spearman’s correlations in Table 1, and learning plots in Figure 4 and Figure 5."

optimal and one sub-optimal. The demonstrations there-in were speciﬁcally designed to emphasize
the utility of knowing the intervening actions. Simple policy evaluation leads sub-optimal behavior
(SPL of 0.53) and past work relied on using an inverse model to label actions (Chang et al., 2020)

performs better than clustering transitions, doing which achieves an SPL of 0.57. The improvement
is borne out in visualizations in Figure 6. LAQ correctly learns to go to the nearer goal, even when
the underlying experience came from a policy that preferred the further away goal."

DISCUSSION,0.34972677595628415,"Our theoretical characterization and experiments in ﬁve representative environments showcase the
possibility and potential of deriving goal-directed signal from undirected state-only experience. Here
we discuss some scenarios which are fundamentally hard, and some avenues for future research."
DISCUSSION,0.3524590163934426,"Non-deterministic MDPs. Our theoretical result relies on a reﬁnement where state-action tran-
sition probabilities are matched. However, the latent action mining procedure in LAQ results in
deterministic actions. Thus, for non-deterministic MDPs, LAQ will be unable to achieve a strict
reﬁnement, leading to sub-optimal value functions. However, note that this limitation isn’t speciﬁc
to our method, but applies to any deterministic algorithm that seeks to learn from observation only
data. We formalize this concept and provide a proof in Section A.3."
DISCUSSION,0.3551912568306011,"Constraining evaluation of V (s) to within its domain. LAQ learns a value function V (s) over the
set of states that were available in the experience dataset, and as such its estimates are only accurate
within this set. In situations where the experience dataset doesn’t span the entire state space, states
encountered at test time may fall out of the distribution used to train V (s), leading to degenerate
solutions. In Section A.12 we discuss a density model based solution we used for this problem,
along with an alternate parameterization of value networks which helps avoid degenerate solutions."
DISCUSSION,0.35792349726775957,"Ofﬂine RL Validation. Validation (e.g. when to stop training) is a known issue in ofﬂine RL (Gul-
cehre et al., 2020). Like other ofﬂine RL methods, LAQ suffers from it too. LAQ’s use of Q-learning
makes it compatible to recent advances (Kumar et al., 2021) that tackle this validation problem."

REFERENCES,0.5300546448087432,"Batch Reinforcement Learning. In recent times, Gulcehre et al. (2020) and Fu et al. (2020) pro-
pose datasets and experimental setups for studying ofﬂine RL problems. A large body of work
examines solutions to the batch RL problem. Researchers have identiﬁed that extrapolation error,
the phenomenon in which batch RL algorithms incorrectly estimate the value of states/actions not
present in the training batch, is a major challenge, and have proposed methods to tackle it, e.g. BCQ
(Fujimoto et al., 2019), BEAR (Kumar et al., 2019b), IRIS from (Mandlekar et al., 2020), and CQL
(Kumar et al., 2020) among many others. In contrast to these model-free methods, Argenson &
Dulac-Arnold (2021); Rajeswaran et al. (2019); Rafailov et al. (2020) learn a forward predictive
model from the batch data and use it for model predictive control. These methods all approach the
traditional batch RL problem, while we consider a different and harder setting in which the action
labels are unavailable. Aforementioned advances in ofﬂine RL are complementary to our work.
Ofﬂine value learning approaches (such as CQL and BCQ) can serve as a drop-in replacement for
Q-learning in our pipeline and improve our results. In fact, our experiments with BCQ substantiate
this."
REFERENCES,0.5327868852459017,"State-only Learning. In line of work which studies learning form goal-directed state-only experi-
ence, researchers use imitation learning-based techniques (Radosavovic et al., 2020; Torabi et al.,
2018a; Edwards et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2019a), learn policies that match the distribution of vis-
ited states (Torabi et al., 2018b; 2019a;b), or use demonstrations to construct dense reward functions
(Shao et al., 2020; Sermanet et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2018; Edwards & Isbell,
2019). These methods make strong assumptions about the quality and goal-directed nature of the
experience data, and suffer in performance when faced with low-quality or undirected experience."
REFERENCES,0.5355191256830601,"Instead of goal-directed experience our work tackles the problem of learning from undirected ex-
perience. Past work in this area employs Q-learning to learn optimal behavior from sub-optimal
data (Chang et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020; Edwards et al., 2020). Chang et al. (2020) and Song
et al. (2020) use domain speciﬁc insights. Edwards et al. (2020) rely on being able to generate the
next state and only demonstrate results in environments with low-dimensional states. Instead, our
work maps transition tuples to discrete latent actions and can thus easily work with high-dimensional
observations such as RGB images."

action b, corresponding to some state and reward distributions, let α(b, s) ⊆A give the set of actions
in A that have the matching state and reward transition distributions,"

REFERENCES,0.7841530054644809,"As expected, Figure S8 (left) shows that the state-based purity of the learned latent actions falls off as
the stochasticity (stickiness) increases. However, these impure latent actions have little effect on the
Spearman’s rank correlation (top right). The Spearman’s rank correlation does decrease but remains
reasonably high even when the stickiness parameter is set to 95%. While the ordering of the values
of the different states doesn’t change by much, we note increasing amount of over-estimation in the
values (bottom right). This is expected as with increasing stochasticity, there is an increasingly large
gap between what LAQ thinks it can control, and what it can actually control. However, the behavior
implied by LAQ is still always correct (bottom left), as the over-estimation is uniform over all states.
Thus, it is possible to get good performance from LAQ in some stochastic environments. However,
it is possible to also construct simple scenarios where LAQ, and for that matter any deterministic
algorithm, will suffer as we describe in Section A.3."

moving in the 4 cardinal directions and 4 diagonal directions. The agent starts in the top left (0,0),
and gets reward 0 everywhere, except for in the bottom right, (5,5). Reaching the bottom right gives
the agent reward 1 and terminates the episode. In the starting square (0,0), the agent has probability
0.5 of moving right, and probability 0.5 of moving down. When the agent is on the top or bottom
edge of the maze (row = 0 or row = 5) it moves right with probability 0.9, and takes a random action
with probability 0.1. When it is on the left or right edge of the grid (column = 0 or column = 5),
it moves down with probability 0.9 and takes a random action with probability 0.1. Otherwise, it is
in the interior of the grid, where it takes an action away from the goal (randomly chosen from: up,
left, or up-left) with probability 0.9, and one of the remaining actions otherwise (randomly chosen

to latent action ˆa, then 0 is the most frequent action mapped to ˆa and thus the purity of ˆa would

of individual latent actions. Overall purity is the average of all state wise purities weighted by how
often the states appear in the dataset."

such a function induces an implicit partition of the state space. Learning to predict the ground truth
action from the latent action ˆa within this induced partition estimates the most frequent ground truth
action, and accuracy measures its proportion, i.e. purity. This exact procedure reduces to the above
deﬁnition for discrete state spaces, but also handles continuous and high-dimensional states well.
