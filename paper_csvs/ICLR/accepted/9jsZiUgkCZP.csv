ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0030581039755351682,"Vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity recently. Even without cus-
tomized image operators such as convolutions, ViTs can yield competitive perfor-
mance when properly trained on massive data. However, the computational over-
head of ViTs remains prohibitive, due to stacking multi-head self-attention modules
and else. Compared to the vast literature and prevailing success in compressing
convolutional neural networks, the study of Vision Transformer compression has
also just emerged, and existing works focused on one or two aspects of compres-
sion. This paper proposes a unified ViT compression framework that seamlessly
assembles three effective techniques: pruning, layer skipping, and knowledge dis-
tillation. We formulate a budget-constrained, end-to-end optimization framework,
targeting jointly learning model weights, layer-wise pruning ratios/masks, and
skip configurations, under a distillation loss. The optimization problem is then
solved using the primal-dual algorithm. Experiments are conducted with several
ViT variants, e.g. DeiT and T2T-ViT backbones on the ImageNet dataset, and our
approach consistently outperforms recent competitors. For example, DeiT-Tiny can
be trimmed down to 50% of the original FLOPs almost without losing accuracy.

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.009174311926605505,"Convolution neural networks (CNNs) (LeCun et al., 1989; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016)
have been the de facto architecture choice for computer vision tasks in the past decade. Their training
and inference cost significant and ever-increasing computational resources. Recently, drawn by the
scaling success of attention-based models (Vaswani et al., 2017) in natural language processing (NLP)
such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), various works seek to leverage the Transformer architecture to
computer vision (Parmar et al., 2018; Child et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020a). The Vision Transformer
(ViT) architecture (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), and its variants, have been demonstrated to achieve
comparable or superior results on a series of image understanding tasks compared to the state of the
art CNNs, especially when pretrained on datasets with sufficient model capacity (Han et al., 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.012232415902140673,"Despite the emerging power of ViTs, such architecture is shown to be even more resource-intensive
than CNNs, making its deployment impractical under resource-limited scenarios. That is due to
the absence of customized image operators such as convolution, the stack of self-attention modules
that suffer from quadratic complexity with regard to the input size, among other factors. Owing to
the substantial architecture differences between CNNs and ViTs, although there is a large wealth
of successful CNN compression techniques (Liu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; He et al., 2017; 2019),
it is not immediately clear whether they are as effective as for ViTs. One further open question is
how to best integrate their power for ViT compression, as one often needs to jointly exploit multiple
compression means for CNNs (Mishra & Marr, 2018; Yang et al., 2020b; Zhao et al., 2020b)."
INTRODUCTION,0.01529051987767584,"On the other hand, the NLP literature has widely explored the compression of BERT (Ganesh et al.,
2020), ranging from unstructured pruning (Gordon et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2019), attention head
pruning (Michel et al., 2019) and encoder unit pruning (Fan et al., 2019); to knowledge distillation
(Sanh et al., 2019), layer factorization (Lan et al., 2019), quantization (Zhang et al., 2020; Bai et al.,"

INTRODUCTION,0.024464831804281346,"2020) and dynamic width/depth inference (Hou et al., 2020). Lately, earlier works on compressing
ViTs have also drawn ideas from those similar aspects: examples include weight/attention pruning
(Zhu et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021b; Pan et al., 2021a), input feature (token) selection (Tang et al.,
2021; Pan et al., 2021a), and knowledge distillation (Touvron et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2021). Yet up to
our best knowledge, there has been no systematic study that strives to either compare or compose
(even naively cascade) multiple individual compression techniques for ViTs – not to mention any
joint optimization like (Mishra & Marr, 2018; Yang et al., 2020b; Zhao et al., 2020b) did for CNNs.
We conjecture that may potentially impede more performance gains from ViT compression."
INTRODUCTION,0.027522935779816515,"This paper aims to establish the first all-in-one compression framework that organically integrates
three different compression strategies: (structured) pruning, block skipping, and knowledge dis-
tillation. Rather than ad-hoc composition, we propose a unified vision transformer compression
(UVC) framework, which seamlessly integrates the three effective compression techniques and
jointly optimizes towards the task utility goal under the budget constraints. UVC is mathematically
formulated as a constrained optimization problem and solved using the primal-dual algorithm from
end to end. Our main contributions are outlined as follows:"
INTRODUCTION,0.03058103975535168,"• We present UVC that unleashes the potential of ViT compression, by jointly leveraging
multiple ViT compression means for the first time. UVC only requires to specify a global
resource budget, and can automatically optimize the composition of different techniques.
• We formulate and solve UVC as a unified constrained optimization problem. It simultane-
ously learns model weights, layer-wise pruning ratios/masks, and skip configurations, under
a distillation loss and an overall budget constraint.
• Extensive experiments are conducted with popular variants of ViT, including several DeiT
backbones and T2T-ViT on ImageNet, and our proposal consistently performs better than
or comparably with existing methods. For example, UVC on DeiT-Tiny (with/without
distillation tokens) yields around 50% FLOPs reduction, with little performance degradation
(only 0.3%/0.9% loss compared to the uncompressed baseline)."

VISION TRANSFORMER"
VISION TRANSFORMER,0.039755351681957186,"Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architecture stems from natural language processing (NLP)
applications first, with the renowned technique utilizing Self-Attention to exploit information from
sequential data. Though intuitively the transformer model seems inept to the special inductive bias of
space correlation for images-oriented tasks, it has proved itself of capability on vision tasks just as
good as CNNs (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). The main point of Vision Transformer is that they encode
the images by partitioning them into sequences of patches, projecting them into token embeddings,
and feeding them to transformer encoders (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). ViT outperforms convolutional
nets if given sufficient training data on various image classification benchmarks."
VISION TRANSFORMER,0.04281345565749235,"Since then, ViT has been developed to various different variants first on data efficiency towards train-
ing, like DeiT (Touvron et al., 2020) and T2T-ViT (Yuan et al., 2021) are proposed to enhance ViT’s
training data efficiency, by leveraging teacher-student and better-crafted architectures respectively.
Then modifications are made to the general structure of ViT to tackle other popular downstream
computer vision tasks, including object detection (Zheng et al., 2020; Carion et al., 2020; Dai et al.,
2021; Zhu et al., 2020), semantic segmentation (Wang et al., 2021a;b), image enhancement (Chen

MODEL COMPRESSION,0.04892966360856269,"Pruning.
Pruning methods can be broadly categorized into: unstructured pruning (Dong et al., 2017;
Lee et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2019) by removing insignificant weight via certain criteria; and structured
pruning (Luo et al., 2017; He et al., 2017; 2018; Yu et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2021;
Yu et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021b; Shen et al., 2021) by zero out parameters in a structured group
manner. Unstructured pruning can be magnitude-based (Han et al., 2015a;b), hessian-based (LeCun
et al., 1990; Dong et al., 2017), and so on. They result in irregular sparsity, causing sparse matrix"

MODEL COMPRESSION,0.05504587155963303,"operations that are hard to accelerate on hardware (Buluc & Gilbert, 2008; Gale et al., 2019). This
can be addressed with structured pruning where algorithms usually calculate an importance score
for some group of parameters (e.g., convolutional channels, or matrix rows). Liu et al. (2017) uses
the scaling factor of the batch normalization layer as the sensitivity metric. Li et al. (2016) proposes
channel-wise summation over weights as the metric. Lin et al. (2020) proposes to use channel rank as
sensitivity metric while (He et al., 2019) uses the geometric median of the convolutional filters as
pruning criteria. Particularly for transformer-based models, the basic structures that many consider
pruning with include blocks, attention heads, and/or fully-connected matrix rows (Chen et al., 2020b;
2021b). For example, (Michel et al., 2019) canvasses the behavior of multiple attention heads and
proposes an iterative algorithm to prune redundant heads. (Fan et al., 2019) prunes entire layers to
extract shallow models at inference time."
MODEL COMPRESSION,0.0581039755351682,"Knowledge Distillation.
Knowledge distillation (KD) is a special technique that does not explicitly
compress the model from any dimension of the network. KD lets a student model leverage ··soft”
labels coming from a teacher network (Hinton et al., 2015) to boost the performance of a student
model. This can be regarded as a form of compression from the teacher model into a smaller student.
The soft labels from the teacher are well known to be more informative than hard labels and leads to
better student training (Yuan et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020)"
MODEL COMPRESSION,0.06116207951070336,"Skip Configuration.
Skip connection plays a crucial role in transformers (Raghu et al., 2021), by
tackling the vanishing gradient problem (Vaswani et al., 2017), or by preventing their outputs from
degenerating exponentially quickly with respect to the network depth (Dong et al., 2021)."
MODEL COMPRESSION,0.06422018348623854,"Meanwhile, transformer has an inborn advantage of a uniform block structure. A basic transformer
block contains a Self-Attention module and a Multi-layer Perceptron module, and its output size
matches the input size. That implies the possibility to manipulate the transformer depth by directly
skipping certain layers or blocks. (Xu et al., 2020) proposes to randomly replace the original modules
with their designed compact substitutes to train the compact modules to mimic the behavior of the
original modules. (Zhang & He, 2020) designs a Switchable-Transformer Blocks to progressively
drop layers from the architecture. To flexibly adjust the size and latency of transformers by selecting
adaptive width and depth, DynaBERT (Hou et al., 2020) first trains a width-adaptive BERT and then
allows for both adaptive width and depth. LayerDrop (Fan et al., 2019) randomly drops layers at
training time; while at test time, it allows for sub-network selection to any desired depth."

smaller groups) are unfriendly to latency, while models that are under coarser-grained sparsity (i.e.,

by default, the input/output sizes of Self-Attention (SA) module, MLP module and thus the entire
block, are all identical. That allows to painlessly drop any of those components and directly re-
concatenating the others, without causing any feature dimension incompatibility. Secondly, Phang
et al. (2021) observed that the top few blocks of fine-tuned transformers can be discarded without
hurting performance, even with no further tuning. That is because deeper layer features tend to
have high cross-layer similarities (while being dissimilar to early layer features), making additional
blocks add little to the discriminative power. Zhou et al. (2021) also reported that in deep ViTs,

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS,0.3761467889908257,"Baseline methods
We adopt several latest compression methods which fall under two categories:"
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS,0.37920489296636084,"• Category 1: Input Patch Reduction, including (i) PoWER (Goyal et al., 2020) : which
accelerates language model BERT inference by eliminating word-vector in a progressive
way. (ii) HVT (Pan et al., 2021b): which reduce the token sequence dimension by using
max-pooling hierarchically. (iii) PatchSlimming (Tang et al., 2021): which identifies the
effective patches in the last layer and then use them to guide the patch selection process of
previous layers; and (iv) IA-RED2 (Pan et al., 2021a): which dynamically and hierarchical
drops visual tokens at different levels using a learned policy network."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS,0.382262996941896,"• Category 2: Model Weight Pruning, including (v) SCOP (Tang et al., 2020): which is
originally a channel pruning method used on CNN, we follow (Tang et al., 2021) and
implement it on ViT. (vi) Vision Transformer Pruning (VTP) (Zhu et al., 2021): which
trains transformers with sparsity regularization to let important dimensions emerge. (vii)
SViTE (Chen et al., 2021b): which jointly optimizes model parameters and explores sparse
connectivity throughout training, ending up with one final sparse network. SViTE belongs
to the most competitive accuracy-efficiency trade-off achieved so far, for ViT pruning. We
choose its structured variant to be fair with UVC."

MAIN RESULTS"
MAIN RESULTS,0.38837920489296635,"The main results are listed in Tab. 1. Firstly, we notice that most existing methods cannot save
beyond 50% FLOPs without sacrificing too much accuracy. In comparison, UVC can easily go
with larger compression rates (up to ≥60% FLOPS saving) without compromising as much. For
example, when compressing DeiT-Tiny (with distillation token), UVC can trim the model down to
a compelling ≥50% of the original FLOPs while losing only 0.3% accuracy (Tab. 3). Especially,
compared with the latest SViTE (Chen et al., 2021b) that can only save up to around 30% FLOPs, we
observe UVC to significantly outperform ig at DeiT-Tiny/Small, at less accuracy drops (0.9/0.4,
versus 2.1/0.6) with much more aggressive FLOPs savings (50.7%/42.4%, versus 23.7%/31.63). For
the larger DeiT-Base, while UVC can save 45% of its FLOPs, we fin that SViTE cannot be stably
trained at such high sparsity. UVC also yield comparable accuracy with the other ViT model pruning
approach, VTP (Zhu et al., 2021), with more than 10% FLOPs savings w.r.t. the original backbone."
MAIN RESULTS,0.39143730886850153,"Secondly, UVC obtains strong results compared with Patch Reduction based methods. UVC performs
clearly better than IA-RED2 (Pan et al., 2021a) at DeiT-Base, and outperforms HVT (Pan et al.,
2021b) on both DeiT-Tiny/Small models, which are latest and strong competitors. Compared to
Patch Slimming Tang et al. (2021), UVC at DeiT-Small reaches 79.44% top-1 accuracy, while
the compression ratio measured by FLOPs is comparable. On other models, we observe UVC to
generally save more FLOPs, yet also sacrificing more accuracies. Moreover, as we explained in"

ABLATION STUDY,0.45565749235474007,"As UVC highlights the integration of three different compression techniques into one joint opti-
mization framework, it would be natural to question whether each moving part is necessary for the
pipeline, and how they each contribute to the final result. We conduct this ablation study, and the
results are presented in Tab. 2."
ABLATION STUDY,0.45871559633027525,"Skip Manipulation only.
We first present the result when we only conduct skip manipulation and
knowledge distillation in our framework, but not pruning within a block. All other protocols remain
unchanged. This two-in-a-way method is actually reduced into LayerDropping (Lin et al., 2018). We
have the following findings: Firstly, implementing only skip connection manipulation will incur high
instability. During optimization, the objective value fluctuates heavily due to the large architecture
changes (adding or removing one whole block) and barely converges to a stable solution. Secondly,
only applying skip manipulation will be damaging the accuracy remarkably, e.g., by nearly 4% drop
on DeiT-Tiny. That is expected, as only manipulating the model architecture with such a coarse
granularity (keeping or skipping a whole transformer block) is very inflexible and prone to collapse."
ABLATION STUDY,0.4617737003058104,"Pruning within a Block only.
We then conduct experiments without using the gating control for
skip connections. That leads to only integrating neuron-level and attention-head-level pruning, with
knowledge distillation. It turns out to deliver much better accuracy than only skip manipulation,
presumably owing to its finer-grained operation. However, it still has a margin behind our joint UVC
method, as the latter also benefits from removing block-level redundancy a priori, which is recently
observed to widely exist in fine-tuned transformers Phang et al. (2021). Overall, the ablation results
endorse the effectiveness of jointly optimizing those components altogether."
ABLATION STUDY,0.4648318042813456,"Applying Individual Compression Methods Sequentially
Our method is a joint optimization
process for skip configuration manipulation and pruning, but is this joint optimization necessary?"
ABLATION STUDY,0.46788990825688076,"To address this curiosity, we mark Prune→Skip as the process of pruning first, manipulating skip
configuration follows, while Skip→Prune vice versa. Note that Skip→Prune 71.49%→49.39%
denotes the pipeline that use skip configuration first to enforce the model FLOPs to be 71.49% of
the original FLOPs, then apply pruning to further compress the model to 49.39%. Without loss of
generality, we approximate both the pruning procedure and skipping procedure to compress 70% of
the previous model, which will approximately result in a model with 50% of the original FLOPs.
Based on this, we implement:(i) Skip→Prune 71.49%→49.39% It first compresses the model to
71% by skipping then applies pruning on the original model and results in the worse performance
at 66.84%. (ii)Prune→Skip 69.96%→54.88% It applies pruning to 70% FLOPs then skipping
follows. We observe that applying pruning first can stabilize the choice of skip configuration and
result in a top-1 accuracy of 69.68%. Both results endorse the superior trade-off found by UVC."
ABLATION STUDY,0.4709480122324159,"Furthermore, we design a better setting (Prune→Skip 63.25%→50.73%) to simulate the compression
ratio found by UVC. Details can be found in Appendix. The obtained result is much better than
previous ones, but still at a 1% performance gap from the result provided by UVC. We assign the
extra credit to jointly optimizing the architecture and model weights."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.47706422018348627,"In this paper, we propose UVC, a unified ViT compression framework that seamlessly assembles
pruning, layer skipping, and knowledge distillation as one. A budget-constrained optimization
framework is formulated for joint learning. Experiments demonstrate that UVC can aggressively trim
down the prohibit computational costs in an end-to-end way. Our future work will extend UVC to
incorporating weight quantization as part of the end-to-end optimization as well."

REFERENCES,0.9418960244648318,"• Sparse connectivity patterns: We first visualize the sparse connectivity patterns in Fig. 3
(a), i.e, how many attention heads are preserved, and how they (sparsely) distribute over
all blocks. For the smaller DeiT-Tiny model, UVC tends to more evenly drop attention
heads across layers; meanwhile, for the larger DeiT-Base, UVC clearly prefers to drop more
attention heads in the early layers."
