ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0025974025974025974,"Domain adaptation is an important problem and often needed for real-world ap-
plications. In this problem, instead of i.i.d. training and testing datapoints, we
assume that the source (training) data and the target (testing) data have different
distributions. With that setting, the empirical risk minimization training proce-
dure often does not perform well, since it does not account for the change in
the distribution. A common approach in the domain adaptation literature is to
learn a representation of the input that has the same (marginal) distribution over
the source and the target domain. However, these approaches often require ad-
ditional networks and/or optimizing an adversarial (minimax) objective, which
can be very expensive or unstable in practice. To improve upon these marginal
alignment techniques, in this paper, we ﬁrst derive a generalization bound for the
target loss based on the training loss and the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) diver-
gence between the source and the target representation distributions. Based on this
bound, we derive an algorithm that minimizes the KL term to obtain a better gen-
eralization to the target domain. We show that with a probabilistic representation
network, the KL term can be estimated efﬁciently via minibatch samples without
any additional network or a minimax objective. This leads to a theoretically sound
alignment method which is also very efﬁcient and stable in practice. Experimental
results also suggest that our method outperforms other representation-alignment
approaches."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.007792207792207792,"With advances in neural network architectures (He et al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017), machine
learning algorithms have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks such as object classi-
ﬁcation, object detection and natural language processing. However, machine learning models have
been focusing mostly on the case of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) datapoints; and
such an assumption often does not hold in practice. When the i.i.d. assumption is violated and the
target domain has a different distribution compared to the source domain, a typical learner trained
on the source data via empirical risk minimization would not perform well at test time, since it does
not account for the distribution shift. To tackle this problem, many methods have been proposed for
domain adaptation (Zhao et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Combes et al., 2020; Tanwani, 2020) and
domain generalization (Khosla et al., 2012; Muandet et al., 2013; Ghifary et al., 2015), the goal of
which is to train a machine learning algorithm that can generalize well to the target domain."
INTRODUCTION,0.01038961038961039,"A common approach to tackle these problems is to learn a representation such that its distribution
does not change across domains. There are two types of distribution alignment: marginal alignment
(aligning the marginal distribution of the representation) and conditional alignment (aligning the
conditional distribution of the label given the representation) (Nguyen et al., 2021; Tanwani, 2020).
For domain adaptation and domain generalization problems with multiple source domains, we can
use the data and labels to align both the marginal and the conditional distributions across the source
domains, aiming to generalize to the target domain. However, in a single-source domain adaptation
problem, with only unlabeled data from the target domain, it is often only possible to align the
marginal distribution of the representation. This marginal alignment should help the classiﬁer avoid
out-of-distribution data at test time."

INTRODUCTION,0.01818181818181818,"This paper focuses on such a single-source domain adaption problem, which is also one of the
most common settings in practice. Current marginal alignment techniques usually require addi-
tional computation (e.g., of an additional network) (Ganin et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018) and/or a
minimax objective (Ganin et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2018), leading to an expensive and/or unstable
training procedure (Goodfellow, 2016; Kodali et al., 2017). For example, DANN (Ganin et al., 2016)
employs an adversarial training procedure, with a domain discriminator that classiﬁes the domain
of the representation, and maximizes the adversarial loss of the discriminator. When the discrimina-
tor is completely fooled, the marginal distribution of the representation is aligned across domains.
MMD (Gretton et al., 2012; Li et al., 2018) utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to align the repre-
sentation distribution. This does not use a minimax objective, thus leading to a more stable training;
however, it does require additional computation of several Gaussian kernels. While more sophis-
ticated (non-marginal-alignment) methods have been proposed recently to achieve better results in
the domain adaptation problem, we argue that studying the family of plain marginal-alignment tech-
niques is still an important task, since they are the backbones that most other domain adaptation (and
domain generalization) methods are built upon."
INTRODUCTION,0.02077922077922078,"To address the above issues of existing marginal-alignment techniques, we ﬁrst derive a generaliza-
tion bound on the loss of the target domain using the training loss and a reverse Kullback–Leibler
(KL) divergence between the source and target distributions. There are existing bounds of the target
loss in the literature (Ben-David et al., 2010), however, these analyses focus mostly on the case of
binary classiﬁcation and the bounds use a total variation distance or a H-divergence between the
distributions, which are not easy to estimate in practice (for example, Ajakan et al. (2014) require
an adversarial network to estimate the H-divergence). In this paper, we show that with a proba-
bilistic representation network, we can estimate the KL divergence easily using samples, leading
to an alignment method that requires virtually no additional computation nor a minimax objective.
Therefore, our training procedure is simple and stable in practice. Moreover, the reverse KL has the
zero-forcing effect (Minka et al., 2005), which is very effective to alleviate the out-of-distribution
problem in practice. This can be explained as follows: the out-of-distribution problem arises when
the classiﬁer faces a new representation at test time that is in a (near) zero mass region of the source
representation distribution (and thus it never faced before). The reverse KL tends to force the target
representation distribution to have (near) zero mass wherever the source distribution has (near) zero
mass (this is the zero-forcing property), which helps the classiﬁer avoid out-of-distribution data. The
reverse KL also has the mode-seeking effect (Minka et al., 2005) which allows for a more ﬂexible
alignment of the representation (to one or some of the modes of the source domain). For example,
consider the classiﬁcation problem of buildings (houses, hotels, etc.) where source images are col-
lected from urban and remote areas of a country (two modes); while the target images are collected
from urban areas but from a different country. Ideally, we want to match the representation distri-
bution of the target domain to that of the ﬁrst mode of the source domain since they are both from
urban areas. The reverse KL allows this ﬂexible alignment (as it results in a relatively small value
of the reverse KL) due to its mode-seeking property. Meanwhile, other distance metrics/divergences
aim to match the whole source and target representation distribution, which might collapse the two
modes of the source domains."

RELATED WORK,0.03636363636363636,"ever, their analyses of the classiﬁcation problem are limited to the case of binary labels. Moreover,
these bounds are only applicable or practical for deterministic labeling functions, which is not the
case for most datasets in practice. Therefore, their analyses cannot be generalized to the general case
of supervised learning. The differences between our bound and theirs are as follows. First of all, our
bound works for the general case of supervised learning: it works for both the classiﬁcation (includ-
ing multiclass classiﬁcation) and regression problems, it makes no assumptions about the labeling
mechanism (can be probabilistic or deterministic), and it works for virtually all predictive distribu-
tions commonly used in practice. Secondly, our bound uses a different divergence, namely the KL
divergence, which is easier to estimate in practice compared to total variation or H-divergence. We
provide a brief review of the above bounds and discuss their differences to ours in more detail in the
appendix. Recently, Acuna et al. (2021) revise the previous domain adaptation bounds and gener-
alize them to a multi-class classiﬁcation setting, as well as to the class of f-divergence (including
KL divergence). However, their setting is still very restricted: the loss function needs to satisfy the
triangle inequality (which does not hold for many loss functions in practice), and they need to know
the true labeling function (optimal Bayes classiﬁer) for a probabilistic labeling mechanism (which is
often not available). We also provide further analysis, that under some reasonable assumptions, the
conditional misalignment in the representation space is bounded by the conditional misalignment
in the input space, which allows for a sound marginal alignment method. This can be seen as an
improvement over prior works. Some speciﬁc cases of distribution shift have also been studied.
For example, Cortes et al. (2010) and Johansson et al. (2019) study the generalization bound for
the covariate shift problem, i.e., pT (x) ̸= pS(x) but pT (y|x) = pS(y|x), where pS is the source
distribution and pT is the target distribution. In contrast, Azizzadenesheli et al. (2019) provide a
generalization bound for the label shift problem, i.e., pT (y) ̸= pS(y) but pT (x|y) = pS(x|y)."
RELATED WORK,0.03896103896103896,"Domain adaptation
While the literature on the domain adaptation problem is vast, we cover the
most closely related works to ours here. A common method for the domain adaptation problem
is to align the marginal distribution of the representation between the source and target domains.
DANN (Ganin et al., 2016) employs a domain discriminator to classify the domain of a represen-
tation and maximizes its adversarial loss (a minimax game). WD (Shen et al., 2018) uses a neural
network function f (which is 1-Lipschitz continuous) to calculate the Wasserstein distance between
two distributions and minimizes it. This is also a minimax game since the Wasserstein distance is
the supremum over the search space of f. MMD (Gretton et al., 2012; Li et al., 2018) uses the
maximum mean discrepancy to align the representation distribution. This method does not need a
minimax objective; however, it requires the additional computation of several Gaussian kernels. Fi-
nally, CORAL (Sun and Saenko, 2016) matches the ﬁrst two moments of the distribution; and while
being a simple method, it fails to align more complex distributions. We consider these marginal
alignment techniques our main baselines since our method falls into this category, and investigate
the effectiveness of the reverse KL divergence in aligning the distributions of representation. Re-
cently, more sophisticated alignment methods (Kang et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020)
have been proposed for the domain adaptation problem, which achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Instead of simply aligning the marginal distribution of the representation, these methods minimize
the intra-class distance of the representation across domains, and possibly maximize the inter-class
distance between them, using the MMD or L2 distance. However, they require pseudo labels for
the target domain (often obtained via clustering). Moreover, they are complementary to our method,
as we conjecture that our method can also be used in conjunction with these, leading to the same
algorithms but with the KL distance instead of MMD or L2."

that since the source and target domains have the same support set for x and share the representation
mapping p(z|x), they also have the same support set for z, denoted by Z. Given the representation z,
we learn a classiﬁer to predict y through the predictive distribution ˆp(y|z) that is an approximation
of the ground truth conditional distribution pS(y|z). During training, the representation network
p(z|x) and the classiﬁer ˆp(y|z) are trained jointly on the source domain and we “hope” that they can
generalize to the target domain, meaning that both p(z|x) and ˆp(y|z) are kept unchanged between
training and testing. The graphical model of that representation learning process is represented
in Figure 1. In this paper, we consider a probabilistic representation mapping; speciﬁcally, the
representation network will output µ(x) and σ2(x) and p(z|x) = N(z; µ(x), diag(σ2(x))), where
N denotes a Gaussian distribution. This can also be thought of as a generalization of a deterministic

Remark 2. Assumption 1 is an optimization goal of the training process on the source domain.
In particular, ltrain (with an additive constant) is an upper bound of −IS(z, y), which is an upper
bound of −IS(x, y). Thus, minimizing ltrain will enforce IS(z, y) to be equal to IS(x, y). For a
more detailed discussion of this, please refer to, for example, Alemi et al. (2016).

This is because ltrain is an upper bound of EpS(x,y)[−log ˆp(y|x)], which is an upper bound
of EpS(x,y)[−log pS(y|x)]. Thus, minimizing ltrain will enforce ˆp(y|x) to be equal to pS(y|x).

KL GUIDED DOMAIN ADAPTATION,0.16103896103896104,"This bound is similar to other bounds in the literature (e.g., Ben-David et al. (2010)) in the sense
that it also contains the training loss, a marginal misalignment term and a conditional misalignment
term (KL[pT (z)|pS(z)] and EpT (z) [KL[pT (z)|pS(z)]] respectively in our case). However, Ben-
David et al. (2010) consider a binary classiﬁcation problem and their bounds are only practical for a
deterministic labeling function (requires knowing the true labeling function, which is unknown for
a probabilistic labeling mechanism, to compute the bound); while our bound works for the general
case of supervised learning with any labeling mechanism. For a brief review of these bounds and a
detailed discussion about their differences to ours, please refer to the appendix. Note that the bound
in Proposition 1 is also true when applying to the input space directly (e.g., replacing z with x).
However, we are more interested in the bound in the representation space, since we can reduce it by
regularizing the KL term."
KL GUIDED DOMAIN ADAPTATION,0.16363636363636364,"To reduce the generalization gap, we want pT (z, y) to be close to pS(z, y). Aligning the marginal
distribution (i.e., pS(z) ≈pT (z)) helps the classiﬁer network ˆp(y|z) avoid out-of-distribution data
since the target representations it faces at test time belong to the source representation distribution
which it was trained on; while aligning the conditional distribution (pS(y|z) ≈pT (y|z)) makes sure
the classiﬁer gives more accurate predictions on the target domain since ˆp(y|z) was trained to ap-
proximate pS(y|z). In the domain adaptation problem, since we only have the unlabeled data from
the target domain, we often align the marginal distribution of z only. However, one problem is that
the conditional misalignment also depends on the representation z, and when learning a representa-

KL GUIDED DOMAIN ADAPTATION,0.19220779220779222,"Discussion on the use of reverse KL:
Our derivation leads to the reverse KL term
KL[pT (z)|pS(z)] as a regularizer of the distance between the two domains representations. We
argue that there are several reasons that make this a good choice as a divergence between the source
and target representation distributions. (1) First of all, as mentioned earlier, the KL term can be com-
puted easily without any additional network or a minimax objective (details in Subsection 3.3). This
leads to an efﬁcient and stable training procedure, which often results in improved performance. (2)
Secondly, the reverse KL has the zero-forcing/mode-seeking effect (Minka et al., 2005) that helps to
alleviate the out-of-distribution problem. Speciﬁcally, the reverse KL forces the target representation
distribution to have zero mass wherever the source distribution has zero mass (zero-forcing), thus"

target representation distribution (green) that helps the classiﬁer avoid the out-of-distribution problem. Reverse
KL allows for this type of ﬂexible alignment (match to one/some of the modes) due to its mode-seeking nature.

nature allows ﬂexible alignment of the representation. For example, consider the case where the
source domain is a mixture of two components (Figure 2a, i.e., it has two modes), and the target dis-
tribution is close to one of the two components. Ideally, we want to learn a representation network
that matches the representation of the target domain to that of the corresponding component on the
source mixture (Figure 2b). This representation will still perform well at test time since we would
not have the out-of-distribution problem (the classiﬁcation network is already trained on this mode
of the source distribution). This ﬂexible alignment (to one or some of the modes) is accepted by the
reverse KL since it leads to a relatively small reverse KL value. Meanwhile, other methods such as
DANN, MMD, CORAL and WD aim to match the representation distribution of the target domain
and that of the whole source domain together, which could compress the representation too much,
negatively affecting its expressive power. For instance, in the above example, trying to match the
whole distribution of source and target domains based on other distance metrics might force the two
modes of the source domain to collapse. The ﬂexible alignment of the reverse KL (while still being
very effective to prevent out-of-distribution data) might be beneﬁcial in some practical cases."

DIGITS experiments. It is clear that in these experiments, aligning the representation between
domains does help improve the generalization performance. Among the baselines (DANN, MMD,
CORAL, WD), MMD performs the best, which we attribute to the fact that it does not use a minimax
objective, leading to more stable optimization. Meanwhile, CORAL performs the worst, since it only
matches the ﬁrst two moments of the distributions and might fail to align complex distributions.
Our method, KL, largely outperforms the baselines, indicating its effectiveness. Visualization of

methods. This visualization can be found in the appendix."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.3142857142857143,"In conclusion, in this paper, we derive a generalization bound of the target loss in the domain adapta-
tion problem using the reverse KL divergence. We then show that with a probabilistic representation,
the KL divergence can easily be estimated using Monte Carlo (minibatch) samples, without any ad-
ditional computation or adversarial objective. By minimizing the KL divergence, we can reduce the
generalization bound and have a better guarantee about the test loss. We also empirically show that
our method outperforms relevant baselines with large margins, which we attribute to its simple and
stable training procedure and the mode-seeking/zero-forcing nature of the reverse KL. We conclude
that KL divergence is very effective as a tool for representation alignment. In general, a limitation
of marginal alignment methods (ours included) is that when the conditional distribution changes
signiﬁcantly from the source domain to the target domain, aligning the marginal would not help the
target domain’s performance. This is also reﬂected in our generalization bound. For future work, we
would want to investigate the use of KL divergence in other types of alignment. For example, we can
follow the algorithm in Kang et al. (2019) to minimize the intra-class distance of the representation
across domains and maximize the inter-class distance between them, but using the KL divergence
instead of MMD as the distance between representation distributions. Another direction would be
using KL divergence to align the conditional distribution across domains in a multi-source setting."

First of all, Ben-David et al. (2010) only consider a binary classiﬁcation
problem. Moreover, as discussed above, the bounds in Ben-David et al. (2010) are only practical
with deterministic labeling mechanisms for both domains. This assumption is hard to be true for
most datasets since the labeling mechanism is usually probabilistic. This makes it not generalizable
to the general case of supervised learning. Furthermore, the loss function is a L1 distance between
the labeling function, which is also not a common choice in practice, which makes it challenging to
generalize to the multiclass classiﬁcation set-up (even if there exists a deterministic labeling function
for a multiclass dataset, using the L1 loss for the one-hot encoded labels would be unreasonable; the
common loss function in practice for the multiclass classiﬁcation problem is the cross-entropy loss).
Finally, the total variation and H-divergence might be hard to estimate in practice since it requires
the computation of a supremum."

or Y is a measurable subset of R (for regression). Note that their bound still cannot work for mul-
ticlass classﬁcation. They also generalize the L1 loss function to a loss function L : Y × Y →R;
however, this loss function must obey the triangle inequality. Although the L1 distance satisﬁes this
inequality, it is not generally true for other common loss functions in practice (e.g., cross-entropy).

train the classiﬁer h on the source domain), the third term disc(P s

alignment, and the ﬁnal term ϵt(h∗s, h∗t) is somewhat an indicator of the conditional misalignment
(becomes zero if f s = f t ∈H)."
Z,0.7402597402597403,"Difference to our bound
The above bound is based on the ideal target loss, while our bound is
based on the source loss. In practice, we have (an estimate) of the source loss calculated on the
source domain’s training set; meanwhile, the ideal target loss is unknown. This makes the above
bound less useful in practice compared to ours. Furthermore, the above bound has similar problems
as the ones in Ben-David et al. (2010): it does not work for multiclass classiﬁcation, it assumes
a deterministic labeling mechanism (which does not hold in practice), it assumes the loss function
obeys the triangle inequality (which generally is not true in practice), and it contains terms that are
not easy to compute in practice (supremum and inﬁmum)."

the best performer (with a large margin) on 8 out of 12 experiments, showing a clear beneﬁt over
other representation alignment techniques. Together with our method, MMD again performs the
best among the representation-alignment baselines (DANN, MMD, CORAL and WD), conﬁrming
that a stable training procedure (with no minimax objectives in MMD and our model) is important
and often leads to better results. It is also worth noting that our model still outperforms MMD de-
spite being less computationally expensive (in this implementation, MMD needs to compute seven
Gaussian kernels for each of three pairs of representation sets in each minibatch)."

This result also agrees with the one observed in Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz (2020) that domain gener-
alization/adaptation techniques might have negative effects when applied unsuccessfully. It should
be noted that the S (sketch) domain is undoubtedly the most different compared to others (only black

ABLATION STUDY: EFFECT OF BATCH SIXE"

model’s performance. Table 5 shows the performance of our method on the RotatedMNIST dataset,
with M0 as the source domain and M45 as the target domain and with various choices of the batch
size. As expected, our model’s performance tends to beneﬁt from a bigger batch size, since it would
alleviate the bias of our objective estimator. We therefore recommend increasing the batchsize
whenever possible. However, our model performs well even for a batch size as small as 64 (which
is considered small in this era of deep learning)."
