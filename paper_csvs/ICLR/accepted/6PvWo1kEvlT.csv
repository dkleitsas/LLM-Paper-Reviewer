ABSTRACT,0.004784688995215311,"While recent work has shown that scores from models trained by the ubiquitous
masked language modeling (MLM) objective effectively discriminate probable
from improbable sequences, it is still an open question if these MLMs specify
a principled probability distribution over the space of possible sequences. In
this paper, we interpret MLMs as energy-based sequence models and propose
two energy parametrizations derivable from the trained MLMs. In order to draw
samples correctly from these models, we develop a tractable sampling scheme based
on the Metropolis–Hastings Monte Carlo algorithm. In our approach, samples
are proposed from the same masked conditionals used for training the masked
language models, and they are accepted or rejected based on their energy values
according to the target distribution. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed
parametrizations by exploring the quality of samples drawn from these energy-
based models for both open-ended unconditional generation and a conditional
generation task of machine translation. We theoretically and empirically justify
our sampling algorithm by showing that the masked conditionals on their own
do not yield a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is that of our target
distribution, and our approach generates higher quality samples than other recently
proposed undirected generation approaches (Wang and Cho, 2019; Ghazvininejad
et al., 2019)."

INTRODUCTION
Masked language modeling (MLM) objectives (Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2017)
for sequences, although recent, have become ubiquitous for many Natural Language Processing
(NLP) applications (Liu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Rogers et al., 2021) because they are easy
to optimize and enable learning of highly expressive and ﬂexible representations by the virtue of
conditioning on bidirectional context (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018). However despite their
popularity, they lack a principled probabilistic interpretation and hence sampling from MLMs, or
characterizing uncertainty about the predictions made with them has remained elusive."
INTRODUCTION,0.014354066985645933,"In this work, we posit that optimizing MLM objectives results in training of implicit energy-based
sequence models that correspond to probability distributions over natural language sequences by
assigning a score to each possible sequence in the large but ﬁnite sequence space. To explore the
veracity of this claim, we develop and experiment with two energy parametrizations (or scoring
schemes) that can be easily derived from the representations learned by the trained MLMs’ transformer
networks. These parametrizations have been inspired by the success of recent work on using MLMs
for sentence-level judgements for discriminating between probable and improbable sequences (Salazar
et al.; Zhang et al., 2019). Although, it is easy to compute the energy/score of a sequence with
these MLM-based parametrizations, the bidirectional nature of MLMs precludes efﬁcient sampling
algorithms like ancestral sampling. Therefore, a primary contribution of our work is to develop
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) based sampling algorithms for these MLM-based energy networks. While
it is tempting to formulate a Gibbs sampling scheme (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) based on the positional
masked conditional distributions used for training the MLMs (Wang and Cho, 2019), we theoretically
and empirically demonstrate that these masked conditional distributions do not necessarily correspond
to any joint distribution or energy network and hence result in invalid Gibbs samplers. Instead, we"

INTRODUCTION,0.023923444976076555,"propose to use these masked conditionals as proposal distributions for transitioning to a new state
(sequence) in the Markov chain of an MCMC sampler based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
(Hastings, 1970). Another contribution of our work is to design a ﬂexible non-contiguous block-
replacement proposal distribution to improve mixing of the Markov chain in our proposed MH
sampling framework, which results in faster generation and better samples."
INTRODUCTION,0.028708133971291867,"We empirically investigate the effectiveness of the two proposed energy parametrizations by examin-
ing the quality of samples drawn from these energy-models in two diverse settings: 1) conditional
generation task of Machine Translation (MT), and 2) Open-ended unconditional generation. We
observe that high BLEU scores for MT, and high ﬂuency scores are correlated with low energy
values which indicates that these parametrizations are reasonable proxies for the desired implicit
bidirectional energy network trained via the MLM objective. We study the behavior of our sampling
approach extensively with different proposal distributions. We also verify the soundness of our ap-
proach by sampling from regions around the mode by annealing the target distribution and ﬁnding our
samples to be competitive with a prominent undirected (and non-probablistic) generation approach
(Ghazvininejad et al., 2019) on MT performance. Moreover, human evaluation of the open ended
generation samples further corroborates the effectiveness of our approach."
INTRODUCTION,0.03349282296650718,"Related work: Much of prior work on energy-based methods has, in contrast to our work, focused on
explicitly training energy networks from scratch. Gradient based training of energy networks (LeCun
et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2016; Du and Mordatch, 2019) has been successful at training models for
inducing distributions over continuous domains but are not suitable for training discrete sequence
models for text. To overcome this problem, recent work has proposed continuous relaxations to the
discrete domain (Belanger and McCallum, 2016; Grathwohl et al., 2021), but the unordered nature
of discrete symbols in text makes it difﬁcult for these models to be effective large scale language
models. Wang and Ou (2017) train text-based energy networks directly via MCMC sampling with a
CNN-LSTM based energy network and a backbone of autoregressive proposal distribution, but ﬁnd
it to be computationally expensive. For more practical unnormalized models, NCE based training
objectives have also been considered (Deng et al., 2020; Wang and Ou, 2018) in prior work. The
parametrization and training of these energy based text models relies on a backbone autoregressive
model (Brown et al., 2020; Sutskever et al., 2014), which causes the resulting energy model to be
heavily affected by the underlying base autoregressive model, and leads to left-to-right generation
procedures that preclude non-contiguous block sampling. Other training approaches for energy based
text models include decoding based approaches (Goyal et al., 2019; Wiseman and Rush, 2016), and
score-based approaches (Zhang et al., 2017). All of these approaches are more expensive than training
probabilistic autoregressive models like GPT-3, and hence adoption of energy based unnormalized
models for large scale language modelling has been under-explored."
INTRODUCTION,0.03827751196172249,"In this work, instead of training computationally expensive energy networks on large scale data, we
focus on interpreting large pretrained MLMs as energy-based models and propose methods to sample
from them. The MLM objectives (Devlin et al., 2018; Clark et al., 2020a;b) are easy to scale to large
amounts of data and learn good representations of the textual data, but they do not have a probabilistic
interpretation. While there have been attempts to train MLM-based non-autoregressive sequence
models and generate sequences from the MLMs in a non(pseudo)-probabilistic manner (Wang and
Cho, 2019; Ghazvininejad et al., 2019; Tu et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2017; Mansimov et al., 2019), our
technique samples correctly from the energy networks underlying MLMs that correspond to our
proposed parametrizations. Our detailed experiments with the proposed sampler provide evidence
that masked language modelling objectives result in implicit training of an energy network, and these
ﬁndings suggest that further exploration in future work, of variants of these objectives for explicit
training of large scale energy networks is a worthwhile endeavour."

compute the unnormalized score φ(X) for every sequence X. At each sampling step we ﬁrst
draw a proposal X′ from the proposal distribution. Then, we either transition to this new state

As we discuss in Section 2.1, the masked conditionals used to train MLMs do not correspond to
the two energy formulations we experiment with and are not appropriate for performing Gibbs
sampling. In fact, our experiments demonstrate that performing Gibbs sampling using these masked
conditionals leads to low-quality samples. However, these conditionals have been shown to be
useful for scoring individual sequences and non-autoregressive generation. Therefore, we propose
to deﬁne the proposal distribution q(X′ | X) for the Metropolis-Hastings sampler by these masked
conditionals. More concretely, to transition from the sequence X, we ﬁrst mask the token in X
at position i, i.e., Xi = [MASK]. Next, we do a Transformer decoder pass and get the masked
conditionals pmlm at position i. Then, the probability of the transition to sequence X′ is the masked
probability of the token at the i-th position in X′, i.e.: q(X′ | X) = pmlm(X′

we additionally need to compute the unnormalized scores φ(X) which, for both the proposed
parametrizations of energy, require masking of each position sequentially and running a Transformer
decoder pass for each masked sequence. Hence the MH sampler is more computationally expensive

the success of prior work in using these locally normalized scores for re-ranking beam search
hypotheses and generating sequences with high BLEU scores (Salazar et al.; Ghazvininejad et al.,
2019). For open-ended generation we observed a similar pattern that the energy values deteriorate as
the degenerate sampler is run longer, but the chain with Enorm was consistently worse than Eraw."
METROPOLIS HASTINGS AND DEGENERATE GIBBS SAMPLING FOR MLMS,0.3444976076555024,"Next, we examine the acceptance ratio of the MH samplers. We focus on the average proportion
of novel MC transition rate–the ratio of proposals that were distinct from the previous state and
accepted–which indicates the entropy of the MCMC transition distribution. For NMT, the degenerate
Gibbs sampler has acceptance probability of 1.0 by design and a novel transition ratio of 0.36, which
indicates that the MLM conditionals are fairly peaked. Both the MH samplers have high acceptance
rates (0.9 and 0.91) but much lower novel transition ratio–0.11 for RAW and 0.13 for RAW. This
indicates slow mixing of the MH Markov chain. For unconditional generation, the novel transition
ratio of the degenerate sampler is higher 0.58, but it is slightly lower for the MH samplers–0.10 for
RAW and 0.08 for RAW. This suggests, that the BERT conditionals yield proposals that are rejected
at a very high rate under our parametrization schemes for open-ended generation."

distribution. While the results for low-temperature settings seem to suggest that the degenerate Gibbs
samplers are practically useful samplers, examining novel transition rates dispels this suggestion. At
low temperatures, the novel transition rate is extremely small for the degenerate sampler indicating
low-entropy of the MLM based transition distribution which in turn reduces the novel transition
rates of the MH sampler as well. Hence, the impressive low-temperature results only corroborate the

of rejection of the new MH proposal, we balance exploration with tolerable rejection by annealing
the number of masked positions with epochs. At the start of the Markov chain, we make large
changes, but gradually make smaller changes as the chain progresses (details in Appendix). We also,
experiment with a block Gibbs sampling variant of our degenerate Gibbs sampler. This block Gibbs
sampler is incorrect as well, however, it is interesting to study because with temperature T = 0.0,
it yields the MASK-PREDICT (Ghazvininejad et al., 2019) algorithm. We specify the results while

QUALITY OF UNCONDITIONAL GENERATION
We conduct human evaluation of our most basic setup–default parameters with non-block MH
sampling. Although, Wang and Cho (2019) use low temperature values, and top-k truncation to
get high quality generations from the degenerate Gibbs sampling scheme, we do not perform any
top-k pruning and keep the temperature at 1.0 for the MLM conditionals used for the degenerate
Gibbs sampler and the proposal distributions for the MH samplers because we are interested in
exploring the behavior of the conditionals and the energy functions yielded naturally by the MLM
training objective. As we observed in Tables 1,2, 3, such measures to reduce entropy of the MLM
conditionals like pruning, and low temperatures yield decent looking samples at the cost of reduced
diversity and exploration. 3 humans familiar with the generation capabilities of language models
were presented with 120 sentences generated by BERT-base and BERT-large with our proposed
samplers, and were asked to provide 4-point likert ratings along two axes: coherence and ﬂuency.
We notice in Table 6 that our samplers outperform degenerate Gibbs sampling scheme and Eraw

CONCLUSION
Our proposed Metropolis-Hastings based sampler enables us to draw high-quality samples from
non-probabilistic masked language models. The empirical analysis and success of our approach with
the two proposed energy parametrizations strongly suggests that the optimization of MLM objective
results in training of an implicit global energy network that induces probability distribution over the
space of sequences and its possible to sample from it using our method. While we primarily focus on
sampling and generation, our ﬁndings open up avenues for devising more direct, stable and simple
training (Deng et al., 2020) procedures for large-scale energy-based sequence models inspired from
the MLM objectives and our proposed MH sampling scheme."

POTENTIAL IMPACT AND USAGE OF DATA"

as energy-based sequence models and devise a strategy to generate samples from the probability
distribution over the sequences implicitly induced by the MLM training objective. While there is no
direct negative societal impact of our approach, we can envision an indirect impact of performing
natural language generation with masked language models. Because MLMs like BERT are trained on
vast amounts of data on the internet, they capture unsavory biases and stereotyopes in the text used to
train them. So far, they have primarily been used to encode natural language sentences and ﬁne-tuned
for few-shot learning for specialized tasks. Our approach focuses on drawing samples from these"

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP FOR TABLE 5"
REFERENCES,0.861244019138756,"Since this experiment focused on obtaining samples from around the mode of the energy parametriza-
tions and comparing them against existing non-autoregressive baselines, to reduce the variance across
runs, we used a temperature of proposal distribution as 0.8. As is evident from Table 1 (Novel
transitions), this does reduce the diversity in generated samples, but the samples generated have
high BLEU scores. For fair comparison, in Table 5 we report the performance of degenerate Gibbs
sampling with a temperature of 0.8 as well. As can be noticed from the experiments throughout
the paper, non-probabilistic greedy mask-based generation approaches tend to perform well when
the only desriable attribute of the generated sequence is high BLEU score but fail when the MLM
conditionals are used for diverse samples characterizing a distribution over the sequences. Another
trick to reduce variance was to artiﬁcially set the acceptance rate to 1.0 for the ﬁrst two epochs (after
warm-starting) such that all the Markov chains have similar trajectory. We revert back to regular MH
sampling acceptance rates after this initialization. As a result, we obtain similar results for Table 5
across all the Markov chain runs and the standard deviation in BLEU scores is very low at 0.13."

LIMITATIONS AND CURIOUS OBSERVATIONS"
REFERENCES,0.9617224880382775,"One of the major limitations of our proposed approach is the speed and computational complexity
of our proposed samplers. A straightforward way of shaving a factor of O(length) is to formulate
an energy parametrization that does not involve iterative masking of each position. Formulating
appropriate efﬁcient energy functions for MLMs is an open research question. The iterative nature
of the samplers however, is more difﬁcult to get around because all Monte Carlo samplers involve
running a chain for a number of iterations much greater than the length of the sequence. Innovative
approaches to accelerate the mixing of chains like block sampling would drastically improve the
computational efﬁciency of such Monte Carlo samplers. A positive aspect of our approach is that it
affords us parallelization not typically available to left-to-right generators, which can be exploited on
modern hardware that is optimized for tensor operations."
REFERENCES,0.9665071770334929,"Another concern is that while our proposed parametrizations are effective and yield good samples,
we are unable to characterize how close they are to an optimum energy network (that maximizes
the likelihood of the training data) that can be deﬁned by a pretrained masked language model. We
notice that while the energy values correspond well to the downstream metrics like BLEU, ﬂuency
etc., there are many ill-formed sequences that are assigned low energy values by our parametrizations
(as can be observed in Table 7). For example, sequences of periods of various lengths (eg. ‘.......’)
have very low energy value under both Enorm and Eraw. Interestingly, these kinds of sequences also
get assigned low perplexity values by GPT-2. It is an open question if it is the ﬂaw of the energy
parametrization that these sequences get assigned low energy values, or if the MLM objective itself is
naturally biased to overestimate the probability of such sequences."
REFERENCES,0.9712918660287081,"Autocorrelation between consecutive proposals/steps in our Markov chains is another potential
concern. To guard against this, in our experiments, we ran multiple chains, and avoided collecting
multiple samples from a single chain. Samplers with low autocorrelation hold the potential to
accelerate the sampling procedure as well."
REFERENCES,0.9760765550239234,"For open-ended generation, we also computed the GPT-2 perplexity of 120 random samples from
GPT-2 in the length range of our experiments and found the average perplexity to be 115.8, which
is slightly lower than the BERT-base Eraw parametrization. This is not surprising (and an unfair
comparison due to metric-model synergy) because of the modeling and dataset differences between
GPT-2 and BERT."
REFERENCES,0.9808612440191388,"We also performed preliminary experiments for debugging our approach which involved treating
autoregressive models like GPT-2 as the energy models and running our MH sampler with MLM
proposals with the GPT-2 autoregressive energy. The generated samples were decent but this is
clearly an inferior sampling strategy to the exact linear-time ancestral sampling strategy for the
autoregressive models. The MH strategy is further affected by the divergence between the MLM
proposal distribution and the GPT-2 energy which resulted in a high rejection rate and low exploration."
