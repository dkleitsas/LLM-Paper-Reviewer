ABSTRACT,0.0010570824524312897,"We consider the problem of ﬁnding the best memoryless stochastic policy for an
inﬁnite-horizon partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with ﬁ-
nite state and action spaces with respect to either the discounted or mean reward
criterion. We show that the (discounted) state-action frequencies and the expected
cumulative reward are rational functions of the policy, whereby the degree is de-
termined by the degree of partial observability. We then describe the optimization
problem as a linear optimization problem in the space of feasible state-action fre-
quencies subject to polynomial constraints that we characterize explicitly. This
allows us to address the combinatorial and geometric complexity of the optimiza-
tion problem using recent tools from polynomial optimization. In particular, we
estimate the number of critical points and use the polynomial programming de-
scription of reward maximization to solve a navigation problem in a grid world."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.003171247357293869,"Markov decision processes (MDPs) were introduced by Bellman (1957) as a model for sequential
decision making and optimal planning (see, e.g., Howard, 1960; Derman, 1970; Puterman, 2014).
Many algorithms in reinforcement learning rely on the ideas and methods developed in the context of
MDPs (see, e.g., Sutton & Barto, 2018). Often in practice, the decisions need to be made based only
on incomplete information of the state of the system. This setting is modeled by partially observable
Markov decision processes (POMDPs) introduced by ˚Astr¨om (1965) (for a historical discussion see
Monahan, 1982), which have become an important model for planning under uncertainty. In this
work we pursue a geometric characterization of the policy optimization problem in POMDPs over
the class of stochastic memoryless policies and its dependence on the degree of partial observability."
INTRODUCTION,0.004228329809725159,"It is well known that acting optimally in POMDPs may require memory ( ˚Astr¨om, 1965). A POMDP
with unlimited memory policies can be modeled as a belief state MDP, where the states are replaced
by probability distributions that serve as sufﬁcient statistics for the previous observations (Kaelbling
et al., 1998; Murphy, 2000). Finding an optimal policy in this class is PSPACE-complete for ﬁnite
horizons (Papadimitriou & Tsitsiklis, 1987) and undecidable for inﬁnite horizons (Madani et al.,
2003; Chatterjee et al., 2016). Therefore, it is of interest to consider POMDPs with constrained
policy classes. A natural class to consider are memoryless policies, also known as reactive or Markov
policies, which select actions based solely on the current observations. In this case, it is useful to
allow the actions to be selected stochastically, which not only allows for better solutions but also
provides a continuous optimization domain (Singh et al., 1994)."
INTRODUCTION,0.005285412262156448,"Although they are more restrictive than policies with memory, memoryless policies are attractive as
they are easier to optimize and are versatile enough for certain applications (Tesauro, 1995; Loch &
Singh, 1998; Williams & Singh, 1999; Kober et al., 2013). In fact, ﬁnite-memory policies can be
modeled in terms of memoryless policies by supplementing the state of the system with an external
memory (Littman, 1993; Peshkin et al., 1999; Icarte et al., 2021). Hence theoretical advances on
memoryless policy optimization are also of interest to ﬁnite-memory policy optimization. Theoret-"

INTRODUCTION,0.007399577167019027,"ical aspects and optimization strategies over the class of memoryless policies have been studied in
numerous works (see, e.g., Littman, 1994; Singh et al., 1994; Jaakkola et al., 1995; Loch & Singh,
1998; Williams & Singh, 1999; Baxter et al., 2000; Baxter & Bartlett, 2001; Li et al., 2011; Az-
izzadenesheli et al., 2018). However, ﬁnding exact or approximate optimal memoryless stochastic
policies for POMDPs is still considered an open problem (Azizzadenesheli et al., 2016), which is
NP-hard in general (Vlassis et al., 2012). One reason for the difﬁculties in optimizing POMDPs
is that, even in a tabular setting, the problem is non-convex and can exhibit suboptimal strict local
optima (Bhandari & Russo, 2019). For memoryless policies the expected cumulative reward is a
linear function of the corresponding (discounted) state-action frequencies. In the case of MDPs the
feasible set of state-action frequencies is known to form a polytope, so that the optimization problem
can be reduced to a linear program (Manne, 1960; De Ghellinck, 1960; d’Epenoux, 1963; Hordijk
& Kallenberg, 1981). On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, for POMDPs the speciﬁc
structure of the feasibility constraints and the optimization problem have not been studied, at least
not in the same level of detail (see related works below)."
INTRODUCTION,0.008456659619450317,"Related works
In MDPs, the (discounted) state-action frequencies form a polytope resp. a com-
pact convex set in the ﬁnite resp. countable state-action cases, whereby the extreme points are
given by the state-action frequencies of deterministic stationary policies (Derman, 1970; Altman
& Shwartz, 1991). Further, Dadashi et al. (2019) showed that the set of state value functions in ﬁnite
state-action MDPs is a ﬁnite union of polytopes. The set of stationary state-action distributions of
POMDPs has been studied by Mont´ufar et al. (2015) highlighting a decomposition into inﬁnitely
many convex subsets whose dimensions depend on the degree of observability. Although this de-
composition can be used to localize optimal policies to some extent, a description of the pieces in
combination is still missing, needed to capture the properties of the optimization problem. We will
obtain a detailed description in terms of ﬁnitely many polynomial constraints with closed form ex-
pressions and bound their degrees in terms of the observation mechanism. This yields a polynomial
programming formulation of POMDPs generalizing the linear programming formulation of MDPs.
This is different to the formulation as a quadratically constrained problem by Amato et al. (2006),
where the number and degree of constraints do not depend on the observability. Finally, Cohen &
Parmentier (2018) described ﬁnite horizon POMDPs as a mixed integer linear program."
INTRODUCTION,0.009513742071881607,"Grinberg & Precup (2013) showed that the expected mean reward is a rational function and obtained
bounds on the degree of this function. We generalize this to the setting of discounted rewards and
reﬁne the result by relating the rational degree to the degree of observability. For both MDPs and
POMDPs the expected cumulative reward is known to be a non-convex function of the policy even
for tabular policy models (Bhandari & Russo, 2019). Nonetheless, for MDPs critical points can be
shown to be global maxima under mild conditions. In contrast, for POMDPs or MDPs with linearly
restricted policy models, it is known that non-global local optimizers can exist (Baxter et al., 2000;
Poupart et al., 2011; Bhandari & Russo, 2019). However, nothing is known about the number of local
optimizers. We will present bounds on the number of critical points building on our computation of
the rational degree and feasibility constraints."
INTRODUCTION,0.010570824524312896,"The structure of the expected cumulative reward has been studied in terms of the location of the
global optimizers and the existence of local optimizers. Most notably, it is well known that in MDPs
there always exist optimal policies which are memoryless and deterministic (see Puterman, 2014). In
the case of POMDPs, optimal memoryless policies may need to be stochastic (see Singh et al., 1994).
Mont´ufar et al. (2015); Mont´ufar & Rauh (2017); Mont´ufar et al. (2019) obtained upper bounds on
the number of actions that need to be randomized by these policies, which in the worst case is equal
to the number of states that are compatible with the observation. Although we do not improve these
results (which are indeed tight in some cases), our description of the expected cumulative reward
function leads to a simpler proof of the bounds obtained by Mont´ufar et al. (2015)."
INTRODUCTION,0.011627906976744186,"Neyman (2003) considered stochastic games as semialgebraic problems showing that the minmax
and maxmin payoffs in an n-player game are semialgebraic functions of the discount factor. Al-
though this is not directly related to our work, we take a similar philosophy. We pursue a semi-
algebraic description of the feasible set of discounted state-action frequencies in POMDPs, which
is closely related to the general spirit of semialgebraic statistics, where this is usually referred to
as the implitization problem (Zwiernik, 2016). Based on this we characterize the properties of the
optimization problem by its algebraic degree, a concept that has been advanced in recent works on
polynomial optimization (Bajaj, 1988; Nie & Ranestad, 2009; ¨Ozl¨um C¸ elik et al., 2021)."

We obtain results for inﬁnite-horizon POMDPs with memoryless stochastic poli-
cies under the mean or discounted reward criteria which can be summarized as follows."
WE SHOW THAT THE STATE-ACTION FREQUENCIES AND THE EXPECTED CUMULATIVE REWARD CAN BE WRITTEN AS,0.014799154334038054,"1. We show that the state-action frequencies and the expected cumulative reward can be written as
fractions of determinantal polynomials in the entries of the stochastic policy matrix. We show that
the degree of these polynomials is directly related to the degree of observability (see Theorem 4).
2. We describe the set of feasible state-action frequencies as a basic semialgebraic set, i.e., as the
solution set to a system of polynomial equations and inequalities, for which we also derive closed
form expressions (see Theorem 16 and Remark 18).
3. We reformulate the expected cumulative reward optimization problem as the optimization of
a linear function subject to polynomial constraints (see Remark 19), which we use to solve a
navigation problem in a grid world (see Appendix F). This is a POMDP generalization of the
dual linear programming formulation of MDPs (Kallenberg, 1994; Puterman, 2014).
4. We present two methods for computing the number of critical points, which rely, respectively, on
the rational degree of the expected cumulative reward function and the geometric description of
the feasible set of state-action frequencies (see Theorem 20, Proposition 21 and Appendix D)."

between two policies that differ on a single state leads to a linear interpolation of the corresponding

CONCLUSION,0.14904862579281183,"We described geometric and algebraic properties of POMDPs and related the rational degree of the
discounted state-action frequencies and the expected cumulative reward function to the degree of
observability. We described the set of feasible state-action frequencies as a basic semialgebraic

polynomial programming formulation of POMDPs extending the linear programming formulation
of MDPs. Based on this we use polynomial optimization theory to bound the number of critical
points of the reward function over the polytope of memoryless stochastic policies. Our analysis
also yields insights into the optimization landscape, such as the number of connected components
of superlevel sets of the expected reward. Finally, we use a navigation problem in a grid world
to demonstrate that the polynomial programming formulation can offer a computationally feasible
approach to the reward maximization problem."

not exploit the special multi-homogeneous structure of the problem, which could allow for tighter
bounds as illustrated in Proposition 21 for blind controllers. Computing polar degrees is a challeng-

map polytopes to polytopes. Further, the extreme points of the range lie in the image of the extreme
points which implies that degree-one rational functions are maximized in extreme points – just like
linear functions.
Deﬁnition 32. We say that a function f : Ω→Rm is a rational function of degree at most k with
common denominator if it admits a representation of the form fi = pi/q for polynomials pi and q
of degree at most k.
Remark 33. We have seen that the state-action frequencies, the reward function and the value
function of POMDPs are rational functions of degree at most |S| with common denominator. In
the case of MDPs and if a policy is ﬁxed on all but k states, it is a rational function with common
denominator of degree at most k.

DEFINING LINEAR INEQUALITIES OF THE EFFECTIVE POLICY POLYTOPE"

problem that is non-trivial in general. It can be approached algorithmically, e.g., by Fourier-Motzkin
elimination, block elimination, vertex approaches, and equality set projection (Jones et al., 2004).
We discuss the special case where the linear map is injective, corresponding to the case where the
associated matrix B has linearly independent columns. As a polytope is a ﬁnite intersection of
closed half spaces H+ = {x | nT x ≥α}, it sufﬁces to characterize the image BH+. It holds that"

this map corresponds to vec(βπI) = (IT ⊗β) vec(π). Hence the linear map is represented by the
matrix B = I ⊗β. We observe that (I ⊗β)+ = I ⊗β+ (see Langville & Stewart, 2004, Section
2.6.3). Notice that B = I ⊗β has linearly independent columns if and only if β does. By the

INTRODUCTION TO ALGEBRAIC DEGREES"

the interested reader to the excellent low level introduction by Breiding et al. (2021) and to the
references therein. Let us consider the polynomial optimization problem (23), where we do not
require p0 to be linear. Further, denote the number of variables by n (in the case of state-action
frequencies n = |S||A|) and denote the degrees of p0, . . . , pm by d0, . . . , dm. We call a point
critical, if it satisﬁes the KKT conditions (∇p0(x) + Pm
i=1 λi∇pi(x) = 0, p1(x) = · · · = pm(x) =
0), which can be phrased as a system of polynomial equations (see Nie & Ranestad, 2009). The
number of complex solutions to those criticality equations, when ﬁnite, is called the algebraic degree
of the problem. The algebraic degree is determined by the nature of the polynomials p0, . . . , pm and
captures the computational complexity of the optimization problem (Kung, 1973; Bajaj, 1988).9
A special case of (23) is when m = n and the polynomials p1, . . . , pm are generic. Then by
B´ezout’s theorem there are exactly d1 · · · dn isolated points satisfying the polynomial constraints
and all of them are critical and hence the algebraic degree is precisely d1 · · · dn (Timme, 2021). If

A, there is a
continuous path connecting π to an optimal policy along which the reward is monotone. If further

the superlevel sets of MDPs are connected."

ρt(s) > 0 for all t ∈(0, 1) or ρt(s) = 0 for all t ∈[0, 1]. In the latter case, we can set πt(·|s) to
be an arbitrary element in ∆A. For the other states and t ∈(0, 1) we can deﬁne the policy through
conditioning by πt(a|s) := ηt(s, a)/ρt(s) and will continuously extend the deﬁnition to t ∈{0, 1}
in the following. If ρ0(s) > 0 or ρ1(s) > 0, then the deﬁnition extends naturally. Suppose that
ρ0(s) = 0, then we now that ρ1(s) > 0 since otherwise ρt(s) = 0 for all t ∈[0, 1]. Now for t > 0

and we can extend it to t = 1. Now we have constructed a continuous path πt, such that ηπt = ηt
and thus
R(πt) = ⟨r, ηt⟩= (1 −t)⟨r, η0⟩+ t⟨r, η1⟩= R(π0) + t(R∗−R(π0)),
which is strictly increasing if π0 is suboptimal. It remains to construct a continuous path between
π0 and π. Note that if ρ0(s) > 0, the policies π0 and π agree on the state s and so does the
linear interpolation between the two policies. Now, by Proposition 46 we see that every linear
interpolation between π0 and π has the state-action distribution η0. Gluing the two paths, we obtain
a path that ﬁrst leaves the state-action distribution unchanged and then increases the reward strictly
up to optimality."

braic sets deﬁned by linear inequalities and equations (corresponding to the conditional probability
polytope ∆O
A) and a determinantal (in)equality of degree at most |S|. This description can be used
to bounds the number of connected components, which captures important properties of the loss
landscape of an optimization problem (Barannikov et al., 2019; Catanzaro et al., 2020). By a the-
orem due to Łojasiewicz, level and superlevel sets possess ﬁnitely many connected (semialgebraic)
components (Ruiz, 1991; Basu et al., 2006) and there exist algorithmic approaches to computing the
number of connected components (Grigor’ev & Vorobjov, 1992) as well as explicits upper bounds,
which involve the dimension, the number of deﬁning polynomials as well as their degrees (Basu,
2003; 2014). Those results are generalizations of the classic result due to Milnor and Thom which
bounds the sum of all Betti numbers of a variety. If we apply the Milnor-Thom theorem to the vari-
ety V we obtain that there are at most |S|(2|S|−1)|O||A|−1 many connected components of V. This
bound neglects the determinantal nature of the deﬁning polynomial and might therefore be coarse.
Using an analogue approach, we can also study the level and superlevel sets of the reward function
in the space of feasible state-action frequencies. Indeed, they are the intersections of the hyperplane

APPLICATION TO FINITE MEMORY POLICIES"
X,0.8742071881606766,"In general, it is possible to reduce POMDPs with ﬁnite memory policies to a POMDP with mem-

policies with a memory that stores the last k observations that were made. Then we could set
˜S := S × Ok−1 and ˜O := Ok. If the ﬁrst state is s0 and the ﬁrst observation that is being made is
o0, then we will associate it with ˜s0 := (s0, o0, . . . , o0) ∈˜S and ˜o0 := (o0, . . . , o0) ∈˜O respec-
tively. If after t steps, the current state is ˜st = (st, ot−k, . . . , ot−1) and the next observation is ot,
then we set ˜ot := (ot−k, . . . , ot). An analogue strategy can be taken when the memory does consist
of more than the history of observations and for example includes the history of decision. It remains
open to explore the implications of the translation of our results to policies with internal memory

the best action in the states 1, 5, 6, 11, 12 and 13. Those are the states that are either identiﬁable
from its observation (this is the case for 5, 11 and 13) or where the optimal actions of all states
leading to the same observation agree (this is the case for the pairs {1, 7} and {6, 12}). In the other
states, where the corresponding observation is ambiguous, the policy randomizes among the two
actions, which are optimal for the compatible states. This is for example the case for the states
2, 4, 9 and 10, which all lead to observation 2. The optimal MDP policy would move left in state
2 and 4 and move right in the states 9 and 10. The POMDP policy has to randomize between
moving left and right, since otherwise the agent could never reach the goal state if starting in 7 or
13. The same consideration applies to the states 3 and 8, which both lead to observation 3. The Julia
code is available in the supplements and under https://github.com/muellerjohannes/
