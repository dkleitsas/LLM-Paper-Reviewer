ABSTRACT,0.0026109660574412533,"Soft-greedy operators, namely ε-greedy and softmax, remain a common choice
to induce a basic level of exploration for action-value methods in reinforcement
learning. These operators, however, have a few critical limitations. In this work,
we investigate a simple soft-greedy operator, which we call resmax, that takes
actions proportionally to their suboptimality gap: the residual to the estimated
maximal value. It is simple to use and ensures coverage of the state-space like
ε-greedy, but focuses exploration more on potentially promising actions like soft-
max. Further, it does not concentrate probability as quickly as softmax, and so
better avoids overemphasizing sub-optimal actions that appear high-valued during
learning. Additionally, we prove it is a non-expansion for any fixed exploration
hyperparameter, unlike the softmax policy which requires a state-action specific
temperature to obtain a non-expansion (called mellowmax). We empirically vali-
date that resmax is comparable to or outperforms ε-greedy and softmax across a
variety of environments in tabular and deep RL."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.007832898172323759,"Every online decision-making problem involves the exploration-exploitation dilemma: to choose
between taking actions that seem best in the short term and alternatives that can provide potentially
valuable information about action selection for the long run. The trade-off between exploration and
exploitation has been well studied in reinforcement learning (RL). The literature on exploration is
vast, particularly in the field of RL theory. Many methods with important theoretical insights are
not easy to use or are not efficient (Jaksch et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2020). More recent exploration
methods developed for deep RL are more practical to use, such as those that use reward bonuses and
counts (Bellemare et al., 2016; Taiga et al., 2020; Pathak et al., 2017). These developments, however,
are as yet quite new and several studies have highlighted inconsistent performance and difficulties
tuning hyperparameters (Taiga et al., 2020; Yasui et al., 2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.010443864229765013,"Due to this, most work continues to use a basic form of exploration: soft greedy operators, such as
softmax (Luce, 1959) and ε-greedy (Watkins, 1989). These operators actually play two roles: for
soft-greedification within the Bellman update when bootstrapping off values in the next state (target
policy) and to encourage some amount of exploration (in the behavior policy). Soft-greedification
within the Bellman update facilitates learning a stochastic soft-optimal policy and can help mitigate
the overestimate bias in Q-learning (Song et al., 2019). This changes the target policy being learned.
For the second role, regardless of whether a Q-learning update is used or a soft-greedy update, the
soft-greedy operator can be used to take actions. Such an approach is actually complementary to
directed exploration approaches, like those that learn optimistic values, because it can provide a
small amount of additional exploration and so robustness to estimation error in the optimistic values.
And for some environments, where only a small amount of exploration is needed, these soft-greedy
operators for the behavior actually provide a sufficient level of exploration."
INTRODUCTION,0.013054830287206266,"In this work, we re-examine the utility of these operators for exploration, and propose an operator
that is more suitable for both roles. In particular, we overcome a few limitations of ε-greedy and
softmax. ε-greedy explores in a completely undirected way. Regardless of the agent’s estimates of
the value of an action, the agent’s exploration step is uniformly random. Softmax—a Boltzmann
policy on the action-values—is more directed, in that it samples corresponding to the value of the
actions. However, softmax is notoriously difficult to tune and suffers from concentrating too quickly"

INTRODUCTION,0.018276762402088774,"due to the use of an exponential. This concentration overemphasizes actions that appear high-valued
under current estimates but are actually suboptimal. This overemphasis can cause softmax to settle
on a suboptimal policy, as we reaffirm in our experiments. Further, softmax is not sound when used
within the Bellman update: it does not guarantee that the Bellman update is a non-expansion, and so
divergence can occur under Sarsa or dynamic programming updates."
INTRODUCTION,0.020887728459530026,"There have been some works attempting to improve on these soft-greedy operators. Several works
have focused on solving the fact that softmax is not guaranteed to be a non-expansion (Asadi &
Littman, 2017; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2017; Pan et al.). One of these works proposes a soft-greedy
operator called mellowmax (Asadi & Littman, 2017) that is guaranteed to be a non-expansion when it
is used for soft-greedification. It also effectively tunes the softmax’s exploration parameter per state
and has been shown to improve stability when it is used for exploration (Kim et al., 2019). However,
mellowmax is not a simple heuristic to use, as it requires solving a root finding problem to compute the
policy for decision making. To solve this problem they used Brent’s method, which is computationally
complex (Wilkins & Gu, 2013). An approach called value-difference exploration (Tokic, 2010; Tokic
& Palm, 2011) adapts the exploration parameter ε and the temperature for softmax over time, using
the difference in the softmax of the values before and after learning. A later empirical study, however,
highlighted that this approach does not perform consistently (Gimelfarb et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.02349869451697128,"Instead of improving these existing operators, we consider a new soft-greedy operator, which we
call resmax, based on a probability matching scheme originally developed in the contextual bandit
setting (Abe & Long, 1999; Foster & Rakhlin, 2020). This technique is similar to softmax in the
sense that it assigns distinct probabilities to actions based on the estimated action-values. However,
unlike softmax, the probability for taking each action is determined using its suboptimality gap:
the difference between the approximated value of the greedy action and the given action. The
policy is inversely proportional to this suboptimality gap, and avoids the use of the exponential
that causes softmax to overemphasize actions. We show that it ensures a minimal probability on
each action, regardless of the action-values, ensuring all actions are explored. We show that it is a
non-expansion, and so combines well with generalized value iteration algorithms. We conclude with
an empirical study, across a variety of hard and easy exploration problems, with tabular and deep
function approximation. We find that resmax outperforms softmax and ε-greedy, especially when
softmax suffers from overestimation."

higher values of τ, softmax action selection becomes more equiprobable. Resmax and softmax share
two essential characteristics: randomness in action selection to guarantee the coverage of the whole

THE RESMAX OPERATOR"
THE RESMAX OPERATOR,0.06788511749347259,"Softmax and ε-greedy remain two of the most practiced soft-greedy operators for value-based RL
algorithms. However, they suffer from several flaws. One of the major problems of ε-greedy is
that it ignores the estimates of action-values and assigns a uniform probability to each non-greedy
action. This undirected exploration results in wasting time taking actions that the agent might already
know are suboptimal. Further, to explore specific parts of the environment, it might need to chain
a sequence of random actions, which might be very low probability. For instance, consider the
RiverSwim environment (Strehl & Littman, 2008) where an agent receives a minor positive reward if
it takes the left action in the initial state, but a much larger reward at the far right of the environment
that is harder to reach. To receive this high reward, the agent might need to take several exploratory
actions in a row, and so typically gets stuck learning to go left."
THE RESMAX OPERATOR,0.07049608355091384,"Softmax is more directed, in that it assigns the probability of each action corresponding to its
action-value. However, if the temperature is not set carefully, softmax will assign an excessively
disproportionate probability to the greedy action because this probability is based on exponential q-
values. Consequently, softmax often overemphasizes actions that currently have high value estimates,
at the expense of exploring other actions. Furthermore, when using the Boltzmann softmax operator
in the Expected Sarsa update, for the expectation of the value in the next state, this operation is
not guaranteed to be a non-expansion (Littman, 1996; Littman & Szepesvári, 1996). As mentioned
earlier, mellowmax operator was designed to fix this non-expansion issue (Asadi & Littman, 2017),
but mellowmax policy is not as straightforward to use as softmax policy because an optimization
problem needs to be solved to select the temperature in each state."

satisfactory convergence properties for certain families of RL algorithms. The resmax policy can
either be used off-policy, on top of action-values learned with Q-learning, or on-policy. In either case,
it is key to ensure we have sufficient exploration. Note that this first role is separate from the second
role of the resmax operator, which is to ensure we have a non-expansion within the Bellman update;
we discuss this property in Section 5. Then, we show that resmax avoids overemphasis by conducting

RESMAX AVOIDS OVEREMPHASIS AND ENCOURAGES EXPLORATION,0.12532637075718014,"A serious issue with using the softmax for exploration comes from the fact that it uses exponents
within its formulation, which can assign an overly disproportionate probability to current estimate of
the optimal action. We call this phenomenon overemphasis, which can cause value-based exploration
using softmax to get stuck in local minima. This effect is analogous to the softmax gravity well
described by Mei et al. (2020) in the context of policy gradient methods."
RESMAX AVOIDS OVEREMPHASIS AND ENCOURAGES EXPLORATION,0.1279373368146214,"To illustrate, consider a bandit problem with two actions, a1 and a2. Suppose that a2 is the optimal
action, but due to stochasticity in the learning process, the estimate ˆq(a1) > ˆq(a2). We visualize
the resultant softmax policy π(a1) over a range of τ for softmax and η for resmax in Figure 1a.
Here we set ˆw(a1) ∈[−5, 5], and ˆw(a2) = −5. In most choices of the temperature τ, if ˆw(a1) is
sufficiently larger than ˆw(a2), the outputs of softmax π(a1) will be near 1. Thus, it may take a very
large number of steps to finally choose action a2 and explore another action. If instead the policy
is chosen according to resmax, the probability assigned to the greedy action is proportionate to the
suboptimality gap and therefore less extreme. Consequently exploration of a2 becomes more likely."
RESMAX AVOIDS OVEREMPHASIS AND ENCOURAGES EXPLORATION,0.13054830287206268,"The severity of the softmax overemphasis problem is further demonstrated in the HardSquare MDP
(Figure 1b). The agent starts in the state s1 and s2 with an equal probability and all actions are
deterministic. The agent can stay in the start states for a reward of 104, or move to s3 and s4,
which gives a short term reward of -1, but in these states the agent can receive a larger reward
of 2 × 104. We use tabular Q-learning with either resmax or softmax as the exploration heuristic
on this problem. We initialize ˆQ(s, a) ←0, ∀(s, a) ∈S × A. Results are averaged over 30
runs. As shown in Figure 1c, the softmax policy gets stuck in the initial states s1 and s2 due to its
tendency to overemphasize the approximated optimal action. On the contrary, resmax can escape
from the initial states and successfully explore towards the optimal solution. We include mellowmax
in our results for hardsquare and note that it performs similarly to resmax. However, due to the
optimization procedure inherent in mellowmax, its runtime is on average 23× longer than resmax.
This prohibitively expensive runtime prevented us from further considering mellowmax in our results."

operator be Lipschitz continuous with an ϵ-soft policy. Policy π is ϵ-soft if π(a|s) > ϵ. As shown in
Section A.1, the resmax policy is ϵ-soft. By the non-expansion property of resmax, we can also say
the resmax operator is Lipschitz continuous (Asadi & Littman, 2017)."

EXPERIMENTS,0.2741514360313316,"In this section, we empirically investigate resmax through a series of experiments. We first use a
tabular hard exploration environment, RiverSwim, to show that resmax promotes more exploration
than softmax since it does not overemphasize. Next, we show that resmax scales to use with function
approximation by benchmarking performance on standard environments. We additionally study
the performance of resmax and softmax when varying the replay buffer size of DQN. Details on

its approximate estimates, and so converge to a suboptimal solution. Resmax does not have the
same overemphasis issues, and promotes more exploration. To illustrate, we use the RiverSwim
environment (Strehl & Littman, 2008). RiverSwim consists of 6 states arranged in line, of which
the agent starts in the leftmost. This state has a small reward but the rightmost state may give a
comparatively large reward. In order to reach this state the agent must traverse the MDP from left
to right, fighting against a “current"" which causes moving right to oftentimes fail. Reaching this
rightmost state requires smart exploration. We use RiverSwim with a fixed horizon, meaning that
after 20 actions the agent will be returned to the start state, in effect making the environment more
difficult. All algorithms are run for 800,000 time steps."

RESMAX PROMOTES MORE EXPLORATION THAN SOFTMAX,0.30809399477806787,"Misleading rewards are rewards that, when pursued, lead the agent away from potentially higher
reward. Following such a signal can be viewed as over-eager exploitation; ignoring the misleading
signal and exploring further can lead to much higher long-term reward. HardSquare (Figure 1b) is
one example of an environment with misleading rewards. RiverSwim is also such an example: the
reward on the leftmost state distracts the agent from the much higher reward on the right."
RESMAX PROMOTES MORE EXPLORATION THAN SOFTMAX,0.31070496083550914,"We ran softmax, resmax and ε-greedy coupled with Expected Sarsa on RiverSwim across a broad
range of hyperparameters (η, τ and ε). The hyperparameter ranges were chosen to match the
technique, for example softmax requires relatively larger values of τ due its exponents. Results are
shown in Figure 3a, where we measure algorithm performance by the total online return across these
hyperparameters. We find that resmax and softmax perform similarly, however resmax achieves a
higher total return under optimal hyperparameter settings than softmax, indicating it is more capable
of escaping the pull of the left state. ε-greedy fails to explore at all, and its total return is hardly
visible for any values of ε."

RESMAX PROMOTES MORE EXPLORATION THAN SOFTMAX,0.31592689295039167,"Stochasticity in rewards can help alleviate some of the misleading reward problem. Uncertainty in the
rewards can prevent over-exploitation of sub-optimal actions and help drive exploration. We replaced
the deterministic positive rewards in RiverSwim with rewards drawn from a Gaussian distribution
with the mean being the original reward and variance of 1. Results are shown in 3b. All three
techniques see a reduction in hyperparameter sensitivity, but resmax and ε-greedy increase their total
return under optimal parameter settings, whereas softmax does not. With stochastic rewards, softmax
still assigns too great a weight on sub-optimal actions, as shown in Figure 3c. Softmax learns to
take the optimal action in the initial state at a slower rate than resmax, indicating that softmax is
concentrating too heavily on misleading rewards."

benchmarking exploration algorithms, we modified the reward system of OpenAI implementation of
MountainCar environment by setting the reward in all of the states to 0, except in the states at the top
of the hill. We have also increased the maximum number of steps in Sparse MountainCar to 5, 000.
All other environments have been used exactly as they are implemented in OpenAI gym. We use
Deep Expected Sarsa for running our experiments in this section, which is the same as DQN (Mnih
et al., 2015) except that instead of the maximum over next state–action pairs to compute targets it
uses the expected value. We selected this algorithm because it uses resmax operator presented in
Equation 3 to compute the targets. So, in this way, we can also see how operator performs in the deep
RL setting compared to softmax. Exact hyperparameter settings are given in the appendix."

buffer size, resmax is able to maintain a good performance with η = 2−8 across different sizes

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5065274151436031,"Soft-greedy operators, including ε-greedy, softmax and resmax, continue to play an important role in
reinforcement learning. They serve dual purposes: they function as soft-greedification within the
Bellman update and induce a basic level of exploration; and hence, are valuable for both on-policy
and off-policy learning. While simple, these operators are complementary to function approximation
and more focused exploration techniques. We propose a new soft-greedy operator, called resmax.
Its properties are both theoretically desirable and perform well empirically. Unlike softmax, resmax
is a non-expansion, regardless of the hyperparameter settings and thus converges under generalized
approximate policy iteration. Moreover, resmax ensures state-action space coverage and it avoids
softmax’s fundamental issue of overemphasis. Our empirical results show that resmax encourages
more exploration than softmax in RiverSwim, since it does not overemphasize and also explores more
efficiently than ε-greedy."
CONCLUSION,0.5091383812010444,"This paper proposes resmax in its simplest form, so there are many avenues for future research.
As resmax is a new operator to reinforcement learning, it deserves further benchmarking and
experimentation in both simple and complex environments in order to shed more light on when this
operator is useful. Another natural direction for future work is to explore adaptation and normalization
techniques which are suitable for resmax. Just like decay schedules for ε, schedules or adaption
schemes for resmax could allow more exploration in early layer, and allow greedier policies later."

ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES OF RESMAX"

STATE-ACTION SPACE COVERAGE"
REFERENCES,0.6214099216710183,"Exploration strategies should satisfy certain fundamental properties to make sure that algorithms such
as Q-learning and Sarsa converge to the optimal value (Singh et al., 2000; Watkins & Dayan, 1992).
A key property is that each state-action pair should be visited infinitely many times during continual
learning. To show that resmax satisfies this property, we prove that the probability of taking all of the
actions will be higher than zero during learning for any bounded action-values.
Property A.1. Assume that there exists qmax such that ∀s, a, |q(s, a)| ≤qmax. The probability of
taking any non-greedy action a and a greedy action b is bounded as follows:"

REFERENCES,0.6266318537859008,"Proof. First we determine the upper-bound and lower-bound for non-greedy actions a and then
proceed to show this for the greedy action b. By analyzing Equation 2, it is clear that its lowest-value
will be obtained only when the difference between q(s, b) and q(s, a) is at its highest. We therefore
get the following lower bound on π(a | s)"

REFERENCES,0.6318537859007833,"Furthermore, the highest possible value for π(a | s) for a non-greedy action a is 1/|A|, which occurs
when q(s, a) = q(s, b). Based on Equation 2, when the probability of non-greedy actions reaches
its highest value, the probability of greedy action b will be at its lowest, which is similarly 1/|A|.
Therefore, we have π(s | a) ≤1/|A| ≤π(b | s) < 1, completing the proof."

elaborate, returns and the number of steps per episode for all the episodes that are finished in the log
interval will be accumulated and averaged. We only store this final averaged value. For instance, if
we set the total number of steps to 100, 000 and define a log-interval of 1, 000, 100 values will be
stored. This way of storing the results of our experiments can save us both memory and space. At the
same time, the stored results are proportional to the performance of each of the employed algorithms.
