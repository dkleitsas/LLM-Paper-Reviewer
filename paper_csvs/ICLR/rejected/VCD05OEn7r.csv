ABSTRACT,0.0041841004184100415,"Deep generative models excel at generating complex, high-dimensional data, often
exhibiting impressive generalization beyond the training distribution. The learn-
ing principle for these models is however purely based on statistical objectives and
it is unclear to what extent such models have internalized the causal relationships
present in the training data, if at all. With increasing real-world deployments,
such a causal understanding of generative models is essential for interpreting and
controlling their use in high-stake applications that require synthetic data genera-
tion. We propose CAGE, a framework for inferring the cause-effect relationships
governing deep generative models. CAGE employs careful geometrical manipula-
tions within the latent space of a generative model for generating counterfactuals
and estimating unit-level generative causal effects. CAGE does not require any
modiﬁcations to the training procedure and can be used with any existing pre-
trained latent variable model. Moreover, the pretraining can be completely unsu-
pervised and does not require any treatment or outcome labels. Empirically, we
demonstrate the use of CAGE for: (a) inferring cause-effect relationships within a
deep generative model trained on both synthetic and high resolution images, and
(b) guiding data augmentations for robust classiﬁcation where CAGE achieves
improvements over current default approaches on image datasets."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.012552301255230125,"Causal models play a fundamental role in analyzing real-world datasets, as many of the questions
underlying scientiﬁc research require reasoning beyond simply associations (Pearl, 2009; Rubin,
2005). Fundamentally, a causal model characterizes the generative process of the observed data via
establishing cause-effect relationships between attributes; for example, a disease causes a symptom
effect (and not vice versa). Consequently, a causal analysis is concerned with data generated and
collected in the real world via natural processes and biological agents (Glymour et al., 2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.016736401673640166,"In contrast, a major series of advancements in machine learning in the last decade concerns deep
generative models that are learned via statistical objectives to artiﬁcially generate high-dimensional
data.
The widespread use of these models across the artiﬁcial intelligence spectrum, from vi-
sion (Karras et al., 2020) and language (Brown et al., 2020) to scientiﬁc discovery (Sanchez-
Lengeling & Aspuru-Guzik, 2018) and decision making (Chen et al., 2021), raises an important
question: What are the causal mechanisms governing a deep generative model? With a statistical
training objective, it is unclear to what extent (if any) the causal relationships from the observed
dataset are retained within a generative model and consequently, the outputs expected from the
model under interventions and counterfactuals. In addition to controlling and interpreting these
black-box models, such a ﬁne-grained understanding can be paramount for formally characterizing
their biases and generalization capabilities prior to high-stake deployments."
INTRODUCTION,0.02092050209205021,"Present Work. We propose CAGE, a framework for inferring implicit cause-effect relationships in
the latent space of deep generative models. Our framework builds off the potential outcomes frame-
work of Neyman-Rubin causal model (Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974) and deﬁnes a new notion of
generative average treatment effects (GATE). A fundamental problem of causal inference is that, by
construction, we cannot observe the potential outcomes under all treatments (Holland, 1986) i.e., at
any given time, any individual can be assigned only one treatment (a.k.a. the factual) but not both.
However, when studying treatment effects for deep generative models, CAGE exploits the genera-
tive nature of such models to overcome this challenge and explicitly generate the counterfactual. In"

gender (treatment) is changed to male. Bottom: Equivalent visualizations starting from a non-
blond male (left panel) and counterfactually changing hair color (treatment) to blond. Generating
counterfactual samples that respect the implicit causal structure yields subjectively better samples."
INTRODUCTION,0.03347280334728033,"particular, our approach utilizes probabilistic classiﬁers for characterizing the axis of variations for
relevant attributes in the latent space of a deep generative model. Given the axis for the treatment
attribute classiﬁer, we develop a geometric manipulation scheme for simulating the assignment of
speciﬁc treatments (in particular, the counterfactual) to an individual. Thereafter, we use an out-
come attribute classiﬁer to quantify the difference in outcomes for the factual and counterfactual
generations and thus, estimate GATE. We refer to our overall framework for causal probing of deep
generative models as CAGE. Figure 1 shows illustrative samples generated from our approach."
INTRODUCTION,0.03765690376569038,"While there is a body of existing work on enforcing a causal structure on deep generative models
e.g., (Kocaoglu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2021; Suter et al., 2019) or using generative models as tools
to aid causal inference e.g., (Louizos et al., 2017; Yoon et al., 2018; Sauer & Geiger, 2021), our
work stands out in extracting the causal structure inherent in existing generative models. As such,
CAGE applies readily to any pretrained latent variable model, without any changes to their training
procedure that can introduce any undesirable trade-offs in learning (Locatello et al., 2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.04184100418410042,"We further leverage the treatment effects estimated via CAGE to deﬁne a natural measure of causal
direction over a pair of variables associated with a deep generative model. Our score is simply
deﬁned as the difference in magnitudes of GATE when considering each variable as a treatment.
The intuition behind such a score is that the ATE when considering the effect as a treatment should
be approximately zero. In contrast, we expect the magnitude of the ATE when considering the cause
as a treatment to be large. We study the consistency of the inferred causal directions for two high-
dimensional image datasets, MorphoMNIST (Pawlowski et al., 2020) and CelebaHQ (Karras et al.,
2017), with known or biologically guessed prior cause-effect relationships."
INTRODUCTION,0.04602510460251046,"Finally, we use these inferred causal directions to guide counterfactual generation for data augmen-
tations. Data augmentations from generative models are immensely useful for dealing with class
and subgroup imbalance (Ramaswamy et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2018; Sattigeri et al., 2018). We show
that augmentations generated by respecting the causal directions inferred via CAGE improve clas-
siﬁcation accuracy by over 2.7% over the baseline and 11.7% over the anti causal direction on the
CelebaHQ dataset for the worst subgroup in the challenging group DRO task. Our main contribu-

THE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES FRAMEWORK,0.07531380753138076,"We brieﬂy overview the potential outcomes framework of Neyman (1923) and Rubin (1974), upon
which we base our proposed method in the next section. In its simplest form, this framework con-
siders the causal effect of assigning a binary treatment, T ∈{0, 1}. Such a framework posits the
existence of potential outcomes for the ith individual both whilst receiving treatment, YT =1(i), and
when treatment is withheld, YT =0(i). The causal effect for a given individual, i, is deﬁned as the
difference in these potential outcomes."
THE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES FRAMEWORK,0.0794979079497908,"The “fundamental problem of causal inference” is that whilst we may posit the existence of both
potential outcomes, YT =1(i) and YT =0(i), we only ever observe the outcome under one treatment
(Holland, 1986). For this reason, causal inference is often performed at the population level, by
considering quantities such as the average treatment effect (ATE):"

DEEP LATENT VARIABLE GENERATIVE MODELS"
DEEP LATENT VARIABLE GENERATIVE MODELS,0.09623430962343096,"The goal of generative modeling is to learn an underlying data distribution given a training dataset.
For high-dimensional data, this can be done effectively via deep neural networks by learning a
mapping G from unobserved factors of variation Z (i.e., latent variables) to observed variables
X (e.g., raw pixels). The mapping G is parameterized using deep neural networks, and can be
learned via a variety of training objectives, such as adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial
networks (GAN; Goodfellow et al. (2014)), exact maximum likelihood estimation (e.g., Normalizing
Flows (Dinh et al., 2017)), and variational Bayes (e.g., Variational Autoencoders (VAE; Kingma &
Welling (2013); Rezende & Mohamed (2015)). For our current work, we can use any such latent
variable generative model. Our experiments will exhibit this generality by considering state-of-the-
art ﬂows (Papamakarios et al., 2017; Song et al., 2019) and GANs (Karras et al., 2020)."
DEEP LATENT VARIABLE GENERATIVE MODELS,0.100418410041841,"In addition to G (i.e., the decoder), we will assume the existence of an encoder ENC : X →Z
that can map any observed datapoint to its latent vector representation. For instance, for ﬂows, the
encoder is given by the inverse of the generator mapping, ENC = G−1. For VAEs, the encoder is the
variational posterior distribution trained alongside G. For GANs, either the encoder can be trained
during training (e.g., Donahue et al. (2016); Dumoulin et al. (2016)), after training (e.g., Richardson
et al. (2021)), or implicitly learned by backpropogating through G to ﬁnd a latent vector z ∈Z
that best represents a target input x, as measured via a reconstruction loss (e.g., Lipton & Tripathi
(2017); Bora et al. (2017)) or a pretrained domain classiﬁer (e.g., (Karras et al., 2020))."

model’s training distribution and we annotate each example xD(i) with binary metadata for two
variables m1(i) ∈{0, 1} and m2(i) ∈{0, 1}. These two annotated variables can be drawn from
a larger unobserved (w.r.t. G) causal process. For example, xD(i) could correspond to a high-
dimensional image and m1(i) and m2(i) could be any two attributes of the image, such as gender
expression and hair color in Figure 1. Apriori, we do not know which of the two variables (if any)
is cause or effect but through D and G, we seek to identify the nature of their relationship within G."

ESTIMATING CAUSAL EFFECTS IN DEEP GENERATIVE MODELS,0.12552301255230125,"We note that any causal conclusions obtained under our proposed framework only reﬂect implicit
properties of a generator G, as opposed to properties of the data on which the generator was trained.
That is to say, it is perfectly permitted, for G to have learned a causal relationship that is inconsistent
with the observational data used for training. As we shall see in §4, shedding light on the implicit
causal relationship learned by G is abundantly useful for pinpointing shortcomings in the model
and informing best practices for counterfactual generations. As a result, this work—by design—
is in sharp contrast with the majority of causal inference literature that focuses on identifying the
generative mechanisms of a ﬁxed dataset as opposed to our focus on the generative model itself."

OVERVIEW OF THE CAGE FRAMEWORK"
OVERVIEW OF THE CAGE FRAMEWORK,0.13389121338912133,"For answering the above question, we propose to extend the potential outcomes framework described
in §2.1 to accommodate latent variable deep generative models. Our approach is premised on com-
puting a generative average treatment effect for a candidate causal attribute, mc, on a given effect
attribute, me, for a given generator, G. Unlike traditional approaches to treatment effect estimation,
the key observation in CAGE is that we can simulate the counterfactuals under a given treatment.
We refer to our overall framework for causal probing of generative models as CAGE."
OVERVIEW OF THE CAGE FRAMEWORK,0.13807531380753138,"For example, in order to investigate the cause-effect relationship between gender and hair color, let
us initially arbitrarily assign gender to be the treatment m1 = mc (cause) and hair color to be the
outcome m2 = me (effect). We note this choice is arbitrary and the overall algorithm will also con-
sider the reverse assignment (i.e., m1 = me and m2 = mc) and if needed, also reveal independence
between the variables. Then we may simulate the effects of treatment assignments by manipulating
the gender attribute in the latent space and measuring the corresponding change in outcomes. We
next discuss our strategies for counterfactual manipulation and outcome quantiﬁcation."

In addition to standard assumptions from causality (unconfoundedness, positivity, SUTVA), the
quality of the generative model and classiﬁers play an important role. For the generative model, we
designed our counterfactual manipulation scheme assuming that the latent space is linearly separable
in the attributes of interest. Further, implicit in our framework is the assumption that the generative
model can generalize outside the training set to include the support of the counterfactual distribution.
On the use of classiﬁers, we need accurate and calibrated classiﬁers (ideally, Bayes optimal) for both
manipulating latent vectors and quantifying treatment effects. While it is impossible to test in—full
veracity— the above assumptions on real-world distributions, there is signiﬁcant empirical evidence
in the last few years that suggest that modern deep generative models and classiﬁers can indeed
satisfy the above requirements for many practical usecases (Denton et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020).

A further important consideration relates to how we
might determine whether an estimated GATE is statistically signiﬁcant. To address this, we can
obtain an empirical sample of GATE scores under the null hypothesis where the attribute mc has
no causal association with me. A simple manner through which this can be obtained is via ran-
domization and permutation testing. In particular, we can randomly shufﬂe the values of a causal
attribute, mc, thereby removing any potential causal association. This corresponds to performing
interventions over the latent space of G which are effectively random projections. This process is

as shown in the left panel of Figure 3 where each color denotes a mixture. We deﬁne the causal
attribute, mc, to be which mixture each sample is drawn from (i.e., from the mixture of 8 Gaussians,
in blue, or the mixture of 3 Gaussians, in orange). We further deﬁne an effect variable, me, to be
deﬁned as one, if the mean of the (x, y)-coordinates is less than 2.5 and zero otherwise. In this
manner, we can see that mc has a causal inﬂuence over me by determining which mixture each
sample is drawn from. We employ a Masked Autoregressive Flow (Papamakarios et al., 2017) as the
deep generative model. The middle panel of Figure 3 visualises the distribution of τGATE under the

ages as found in the CelebaHQ dataset (Karras et al., 2017). For our G we employ a powerful gen-
erative model in StyleGAN2 (Karras et al., 2020) which is pretrained on the FlickrFacesHQ (Karras
et al., 2019). To align the latent spaces between our desired causal discovery and FlickrFaces we
ﬁnetune the pretrained model using 10% of CelebaHQ. In table 1, we report the direction of causality
found by each of the baselines and our approach using ∆τ. For each DAG considered we also gen-
erate counterfactual samples by manipulating one attribute and qualitatively observing downstream
effects on the other. To diagnose independence between attributes, we also plot a histogram of ∆τ
scores under 100 random latent projections which allow us to reject the null hypothesis if the true
∆τ (black line) is signiﬁcant. In the absence of ground truth labels for causal associations, we posit
a plausible causal relationship between each pair of attributes (e.g. Gender →Mustache) which we
accept as a non-controversial biological prior. We observe that ∆τ in all but one case—unlike each
baseline —is consistently capable of diagnosing the causal relationship implicit to G. For example,
for the causal relationship: Gender →Mustache, we observe counterfactual samples where gender
(top row) is manipulated—i.e. from male to female–the mustache attribute also changes. In contrast,
when the effect variable (bot row) is manipulated there is a reduced impact on the perceived gender.
We also consider three causal discovery baselines: 1. LiNGAM (Shimizu et al., 2006) 2. Addi-
tive Noise Model (Hoyer et al., 2008), and 3. DAGs with No Tears (Zhang et al., 2018). For a
fair comparison, and to be able to make causal statements about a generator as opposed to observed
data, the causal discovery baselines operate on the class probabilities learned by the proxy classiﬁers
described in §3.3 (see §B for further information on implementation details)."

hair color (H) which maybe is causally related with gender (G) (Hysi et al., 2018). In this case, the
smallest group are blonde males that constitute only

ﬁnetuned StyleGAN2 to augment the total number of blonde males by a factor of 10 in two separate
ways. First, we manipulate the hair color of all non-blonde males which we hypothesize corresponds
to changing only the effect variable. The second approach seeks to generate additional samples of
blond males by manipulating the gender of blond females in CelebA. For both approaches, we
generate images of dimensions 1024 × 1024 which are then downsampled via bilinear interpolation

is clear that if the end goal is to generate more blonde males the generative model must manipulate
the effect variable. Quantitatively, we compute a bootstrapped FID score over 10 trials for each
setup’s generated samples, using their respective against the true distribution of blonde males. We
ﬁnd that the FIDs for the counterfactuals in the inferred causal direction (G →H) improve over the
anticausal direction by 19.5% revealing that using G’s learned causal relationship yields semanti-
cally better samples. Finally, we ﬁnd that augmentation by manipulating the effect, hair color, in this
case, leads to a 2.7% gain in test accuracy in comparison to a −1.6% decrease when manipulating
gender. Moreover, we observe the largest drop in test worst group accuracy when we generate syn-
thetic samples without respecting the implicit causal associations in G, with classiﬁcation accuracy
dropping to 75%—serving as an important example for the need for a causal understanding of G."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.5062761506276151,"CAGE is conceptually related to several methods, both within the generative modeling literature as
well as the causal inference literature in general. With regards to the generative models, there is a rich
line of work exploring the use of causal models to learn disentangled representations as advocated
by Sch¨olkopf et al. (2021) and Gresele et al. (2021). Both Sauer & Geiger (2021) and Besserve et al.
(2018) leverage to notion of independent mechanisms, encoded as structural equation models, to
obtain disentangled generative models which are subsequently employed to generate counterfactual
samples. Pawlowski et al. (2020) propose a framework which incorporates deep probabilistic models
as components within a structural equation model. In contrast with this work, CAGE instead focuses
on quantifying when such causal biases have been internalized by a generator. In this sense, CAGE
can be seen as solving the reverse problem to CausalGAN (Kocaoglu et al., 2017), which trains
generative models such that they are consistent with a given causal graph."
RELATED WORK,0.5104602510460251,"Concurrently, there is a body of related work which leverages deep generative models to solve causal
inference tasks. Louizos et al. (2017) and Yoon et al. (2018) employ generative models to estimate
individual treatment effects by generating counterfactuals under alternative treatment regimes. Tran
& Blei (2017) and Wang & Blei (2019) synthesize ideas from causality and generative modeling to
address challenges associated with unobserved confounding. Finally, deep generative models have
also been used for causal discovery tasks, examples include Kalainathan et al. (2018); Lopez-Paz
& Oquab (2016) and Khemakhem et al. (2021), which is in sharp contrast with this work which
focuses on uncovering causal structure within G, as opposed to the training data."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5188284518828452,"We proposed CAGE, a framework for inferring cause-effect relationships within the latent space
of deep generative model via geometric manipulations. CAGE is well suited to a wide family of
modern deep generative models trained on complex high-dimensional data and does not require any
altering of the original training objective nor hard to obtain counterfactual data. Empirically, we
ﬁnd CAGE reliably extracts correct cause-effect relationships in controlled settings like MorphoM-
NIST. On high-resolution image data such as CelebAHQ, CAGE reveals—occasionally contrary to a
biological prior—cause-effect relationships that are best supported by generated counterfactual sam-
ples. Finally, using causal insights supplied by CAGE we also perform guided data augmentations
and power a supervised distributionally robust optimization task, obtaining a 2.7% improvement
over the state-of-the-art in rare subgroup classiﬁcation."
CONCLUSION,0.5230125523012552,"Limitations. Despite CAGE’s broad applicability to deep generative models, one important limi-
tation is the requirement of a latent space. Fully observed generative models (e.g., autoregressive
modes) do not have an explicit latent space and we will need to adapt their internal representations
for probing via CAGE. In addition, the notion of GATE in CAGE, while being novel and tested rig-
orously empirically, does not entirely follow the same analysis as ATE. We implicitly borrow some
key assumptions regarding unconfoundedness and introduce new ones such as linear separability
in semantic attributes of the latent space in designing our estimator. These assumptions may not
always hold in practice and future work can investigate both theoretically and empirically if and
when mitigation strategies are needed. Finally, as we consider only binary attributes in this work,
the extension of our framework to richer non-binary attributes and more than two variables (as in
structural causal models) is an interesting direction for future work."

ETHICS STATEMENT,0.5355648535564853,"As deep generative models grow in their practicality and deployment in high-stake applications, it
is important to take a critical view of the inherent biases implicitly encoded in these models (Sheng
et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2020; Bender et al., 2021). Our framework allows for a principled study of
such biases through a causal analysis, potentially paving the way to mitigate the undesirable harms
of deep generative models."
ETHICS STATEMENT,0.5397489539748954,"For example, our approach highlights important failings of the generative model itself—e.g. when
cause-effect relationships are inconsistent with biological priors for human subjects or with physical
relationships for scientiﬁc applications. In such cases, the use of these models in any high-stakes
downstream application can be very costly without any intervention. Examples range from the
current use of generative models for accelerating scientiﬁc discovery as well as societal applications
in training fair classiﬁers. Ironically, in all such applications, the use of generative models can
worsen the problem at hand by introducing new blindspots through the use of generated data that
does not conform to the desired cause-effect relationship. Explicitly inferring these failings provides
researchers and practitioners with an opportunity to develop algorithms and evaluation metrics that
go beyond the current focus on visual ﬁdelity or likelihoods as well as derive better data acquisition
strategies for ﬁnetuning generative models."
ETHICS STATEMENT,0.5439330543933054,"On the other hand, we acknowledge that like many other efforts in generative modeling, our en-
deavors for better understanding these models can potentially be exploited by malicious actors for
generating fake content, commonly known as Deepfakes (Korshunov & Marcel, 2018). Finally,
causality has proven to be a highly powerful tool for formalizing important concerns of machine
learning models with regards to fairness, robustness, and interpretability. However, as highlighted
in our limitations, any causal framework including ours itself implicitly encodes some assumptions
that may not hold in practice. Hence, researchers and practitioners should exercise due caution and
appropriate judgment in interpreting the ﬁndings."

REFERENCES,0.8158995815899581,"• First, as we are interrogating a generative model, we can observe both Ymc=1(i) and
Ymc=0(i). This is a signiﬁcant difference to standard ATE calculations, which can only
observe one outcome.
• Second, we are interested in understanding implicit causal structure in the generator, G,
the expectation over samples from the prior of G as opposed to over samples from an
observational dataset. This is an important distinction as it disambiguates the causal struc-
ture present in an observation dataset, which is the focus of traditional causal discovery
methodology, with any causal structure implicit within the generator, which is our primary
concern."

further assumptions such as:"
REFERENCES,0.8242677824267782,"1. Counterfactual parameterization: The latent space of a generator, G, must be linearly
separable with respect to the attributes of interest. This assumption is required as CAGE
parameterizes the assignment of counterfactual treatments as linear manipulations over the
latent space of a generator. We note that such an assumption has been shown to hold in
practice for deep generative models (Denton et al., 2019; Ramaswamy et al., 2021).
2. Complete support of the generator: The generator, G, can generate high quality samples
over the entire support of its latent space, Z. This assumption is required to guarantee that
linear manipulations over the latent space of a generator continue to produce high quality
images, such that our resulting conclusions are not the result of e.g., image artefacts.
3. Sufﬁciently expressive and accurate classiﬁers: CAGE is premised on the use of proba-
bilistic classiﬁers in order to quantify the presence/absence of an effect variable on coun-
terfactual examples and thus compute treatment effects as speciﬁed in equations (5-6). We
require accurate and calibrated classiﬁers (ideally, Bayes optimal) for computing GATE."

second attribute depending on context. We note that the generated samples may expose unintended
biases that may be present in CelebAHQ and can be learned by the generator. While CAGE does not
introduce any new sources of biases it should be noted that generating counterfactuals in this manner
