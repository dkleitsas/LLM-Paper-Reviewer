ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0026455026455026454,"In classical federated learning, the clients contribute to the overall training by
communicating local updates for the underlying model on their private data to
a coordinating server. However, updating and communicating the entire model
becomes prohibitively expensive when resource-constrained clients collectively
aim to train a large machine learning model. Split learning provides a natural
solution in such a setting, where only a (small) part of the model is stored and
trained on clients while the remaining (large) part of the model only stays at
the servers. Unfortunately, the model partitioning employed in split learning
signiﬁcantly increases the communication cost compared to the classical federated
learning algorithms. This paper addresses this issue by proposing an end-to-end
training framework that relies on a novel vector quantization scheme accompanied
by a gradient correction method to reduce the additional communication cost
associated with split learning. An extensive empirical evaluation on standard
image and text benchmarks shows that the proposed method can achieve up to
490× communication cost reduction with minimal drop in accuracy, and enables a
desirable performance vs. communication trade-off."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.007936507936507936,"Federated learning (FL) is an emerging ﬁeld that collaboratively trains machine learning models on
decentralized data (Li et al., 2019; Kairouz et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021). One major advantage of FL
is that it does not require clients to upload their data which may contain sensitive personal information.
Instead, clients separately train local models on their private datasets, and the resulting locally trained
model parameters are infrequently synchronized with the help of a coordinating server (McMahan
et al., 2017). While the FL framework helps alleviate data-privacy concerns for distributed training,
most of existing FL algorithms critically assume that the clients have enough compute and storage
resources to perform local updates on the entire machine learning model. However, this assumption
does not necessarily hold in many modern applications. For example, classiﬁcation problems with
an extremely large number of classes (often in millions and billions) commonly arise in the context
of recommender systems (Covington et al., 2016), information retrieval (Agrawal et al., 2013), and
language modeling (Levy & Goldberg, 2014). Here, the classiﬁcation layer of a neural network itself
is large enough that a typical FL client, e.g., a mobile or IoT device, cannot even store and locally
update this single layer, let alone the entire neural network."
INTRODUCTION,0.010582010582010581,"Split learning (SL) is a recently proposed technique (Vepakomma et al., 2018; Thapa et al., 2020)
that naturally addresses the above issue of FL. It splits the underlying model between the clients and
server such that the ﬁrst few layers are shared across the clients and the server, while the remaining
layers are only stored at the server. The reduction of resource requirement at the clients is particularly
pronounced when the last few dense layers constitute a large portion of the entire model. For instance,
in a convolutional neural network (Krizhevsky, 2014), the last two fully connected layers take 95%
parameters of the entire model. In this case, if we allocate the last two layers to the server, then
the client-side memory usage can be reduced by 20×. Nonetheless, one major limitation of SL is
that the underlying model partitioning leads to an increased communication cost for the resulting
framework. Speciﬁcally, to train the split neural network, the activations and gradients at the layer
where the model is split (referred to as cut layer) need to be communicated between the server and"

the activation size. As a result, the communication cost for the model training can become prohibitive
whenever the mini-batch size and the activation size of the cut layer are large (e.g. in one of our
experiments, the additional message size can be 10 times larger than that of the client-side model)."
INTRODUCTION,0.047619047619047616,"In this paper, we aim to make the split neural network training communication-efﬁcient and enable
its widespread adoption for FL in resource-constrained settings. Our proposed solution is based on
the critical observation that, given a mini-batch of data, the client does not need to communicate
per-example activation vectors if the activation vectors (at the cut layer) for different examples in the
mini-batch exhibit enough similarity. Thus, we propose a training framework that performs clustering
of the activation vectors and only communicates the cluster centroids to the server. Interestingly,
this is equivalent to adding a vector quantization layer in the middle of the split neural network (see
Figure 1 for an overview of our proposed method). Our main contributions are as follows."
INTRODUCTION,0.05026455026455026,"• We propose an end-to-end communication-efﬁcient neural network splitting-based FL approach
for resource-constrained clients (cf. Section 4). The approach employs a novel compression
scheme that leverages product quantization to effectively compress the activations communicated
between the clients and server.
• After applying the activation quantization, the clients can only receive possibly noisy gradients
from the server. The inaccurate client-side model updates lead to signiﬁcant accuracy drops in our
experiments. In order to mitigate this problem, we propose a gradient correction scheme for the
backward pass, which plays a critical role in achieving a high compression ratio with minimal
accuracy loss.
• We empirically evaluate the performance of our approach on three standard FL datasets (cf. Sec-
tion 5). Remarkably, we show that our approach allows for up to 490× communication reduction
without signiﬁcant accuracy loss.
• We present a convergence analysis for the proposed method (cf. Section 4.3), which reveals a
trade-off between communication reduction and convergence speed. The analysis further helps
explain why the proposed gradient correction technique is beneﬁcial."
INTRODUCTION,0.05291005291005291,"Here we note that our proposed method has potential applications beyond FL with resource-
constrained clients as it can be applied in any learning framework that can beneﬁt from a quantization
layer. For instance, it can be used to reduce the communication overhead in two-party vertical
FL (Romanini et al., 2021), where the model is naturally split across two institutions and the data
labels are generated on the server. It is also worth mentioning that the proposed method does not
expose any additional client-side information to the server than vanilla split neural network training
approach, such as SPLITFED (Thapa et al., 2020). Thus, our method can also leverage existing
privacy preserving mechanisms such as differential privacy (Wei et al., 2020) or instance-hiding
schemes (Huang et al., 2020) to provide formal privacy guarantees."

under a FL framework, the clients perform local training and only communicate the resulting models
to a coordinating server as opposed to sharing their raw local data with the server (McMahan et al.,
2017). In current FL algorithms, the model size is limited by the resource constraints of clients.
Consequently, these algorithms are not feasible when dealing with large machine learning models that
cannot ﬁt in clients memory or require large compute. Compared to these vanilla FL algorithms, split
learning-based approaches enables learning on resource-constrained clients at a cost of additionally
exposing the label information of clients to the server."

example, Diao et al. (2020) varied the layer width on clients depending on their computational
capacities; and Horvath et al. (2021) proposed ordered dropout to randomly removing neurons in
the neural network. These methods are effective in reducing the width of the intermediate layers;
however, they still place the full classiﬁcation layer (which is in proportion to the size of the output
space) on each client to compute the the client update. This may not be feasible for many clients
as the parameters in the classiﬁcation layer of a model can dominate the total number of model

the clients and the server. However, this kind of method is not suitable for the settings where the
classiﬁcation layer dominates the entire model size such that the clients may not have enough memory

up to 20× compression ratio (uncompressed/compressed). However, in practice it might be tricky
to set the threshold for sparsiﬁcation. Our proposed method explores an orthogonal dimension of
sparsiﬁcation by clustering similar activations within the mini-batches and communicating only
the cluster centroids. Empirical results show that the proposed method can achieve up to 490×

each chunk. Now, the resulting cluster centroids construct the codebook and the closest codeword
will be used to represent each vector. Instead of directly computing the distance between two high-
dimensional vectors, computing the distance between two codewords is orders of magnitude more
efﬁcient and faster. Note that the previous works used PQ to compress either learned features after
training (see, e.g., Ge et al., 2013a) or the parameters of a neural network (see, e.g., Chen et al., 2020).
In this paper, we show that PQ is also effective in compressing the output of intermediate layers and

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORKS,0.1111111111111111,"Besides, note that, a selected client needs to upload both the activations during “Client Forward

the communication size per client per iteration can be written as |wc| + Bd. Since the up-link
communication bandwidth is quite limited for clients in federated learning, when the mini-batch size
B or the dimension of the activation d gets large, the up-link communication may become the main
bottleneck that limits the scalability of SPLITFED. It is critical to compress the uploaded message
from clients to the server (Reisizadeh et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Next, we present a novel vector

Instead of sending a mini-batch of B vectors, only L centroids and the cluster assignments are
transmitted to the server. This procedure is equivalent to vector quantization. Here, a simple choice
of the clustering algorithm is K-means (Krishna & Murty, 1999). However, as we observe in Figure 3,
vanilla K-means clustering leads to a high quantization error with very limited compression ratio. It
is non-trivial to design a proper clustering algorithm that can minimize the communication between
clients and server, while maintaining a low quantization error. In Section 4.1, we design a novel
variant of product quantizer that can ﬂexibly operate this trade-off."

backward pass, due to the additional quantization layer, the server no longer knows the true client
activations; thus, constraining the server to compute the gradients with respect to the (possibly noisy)
quantized activations. Furthermore, in order to update the client-side model parameters, the clients
need to receive the gradients with respect to the original activations, which is not available any more.

group to share the same codebook. As a result, the total codebook size can be reduced to φdLR/q.
When q ≫R ≥1, there can be an order of magnitude increase in the compression ratio, as illustrated
by the red lines in Figure 3. One can also observe that, by changing the value of R, our proposed
quantizer (red lines) achieves a much better error-versus-compression trade-off than K-means and
vanilla production quantization scheme."
BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORKS,0.2222222222222222,"Why not Reuse the Codebooks from Previous Iterations? In our proposed scheme, the codebook
is reconstructed at each iteration on clients. This is necessary, since in FL, only few stateless clients are

et al., 2019). Previous codebooks can be stale and other clients’ codebooks may not be suitable."

BACKWARD PASS: GRADIENT CORRECTION"
BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORKS,0.23544973544973544,"As mentioned at the beginning of Section 4, there is a gradient mismatch problem in the client
backward pass. While client i needs ∇zih(ws; zi) to update the client-side models, it can only
receive ∇ezih(ws; ezi) from the server. A naive solution is to treat ∇ezih as an approximation of ∇zih
and update the client-side model by ∇ezih(ws; ezi)∇wcu(wc; ξ) = (∂f/∂ezi)(∂zi/∂wc). However,
due to gradient mismatch, this approach can lead to a signiﬁcant performance drop, as observed in our
experiments (cf. Section 5). In order to address this issue, we propose a gradient correction technique.
In particular, we approximate the gradient ∇zih(ws; zi) by its ﬁrst-order Taylor series expansion:
∇ezih(ws; ezi) + ∇2
ezih(ws; ezi) · (zi −ezi). While the higher-order derivative may be expensive to
compute, we use a scalar parameter λI > 0 to replace ∇2
ezih(ws; ez)i. Consequently, the gradient of
the client-side model is deﬁned as follows:"

encourages the client-side model wc to move in a direction that can decrease the quantization error
∥zi−ezi∥. Interestingly, using a larger value of λ may let clients put more emphasis on minimizing the
quantization error and lead to quantization-friendly activations. However, one cannot set a arbitrarily
large value for λ because the client-side model may output the same activation for all inputs and fail
to minimize the original loss function."

EXPERIMENTS,0.29365079365079366,"We implement the proposed method FEDLITE using FedJAX (Ro et al., 2021) and evaluate its
effectiveness on three standard federated datasets provided by the Tensorﬂow Federated (TFF)
package (TFF, 2021): (i) image classiﬁcation on FEMNIST, (ii) tag prediction on StackOverﬂow
(referred to as SO Tag) and (iii) next word prediction on StackOverﬂow (referred to as SO NWP). On
FEMNIST, the same model architecture as (Reddi et al., 2020) is adopted. We place two convolutional
layers and two dense layers on the clients and the server, respectively. With this splitting, the client-
side model only has about 1.6% trainable parameters of the entire model. Therefore, the client-side
resource requirement is signiﬁcantly reduced. On SO Tag, both the client- and server-side models
contains only one dense layer. On SO NWP, we place one LSTM layer and one dense layer on the
clients, and another dense layer on the server. The ratios between the client-side model size and entire
model size are 83% and 79% on SO Tag and SO NWP, respectively. Here, we note that even though
the client-side model sizes for SO Tag and SO NWP do not correspond to an ideal setting for the split
learning-based approaches, we include these two datasets to showcase the utility of our proposed
method for language-based tasks."
EXPERIMENTS,0.2962962962962963,"For each task, we select the learning rate that is best for the baseline SPLITFED algorithm. Although
separately tuning the learning rate for our proposed method can further improve its performance,
using the same learning rate as SPLITFED already demonstrates the advantages of our method. Unless
otherwise stated, the number of groups R in our proposed quantizer is set to 1, as it exhibits the best
trade-off in Figure 3 and experiments."
EXPERIMENTS,0.29894179894179895,"Main Results: Effectiveness of FedLite. As discussed in Section 4.1, there is a trade-off between
the ﬁnal performance and compression ratio. Although the additional quantization layer helps reduce
the communication cost, it also causes performance drop. While utilizing the quantization layer, it is
important to understand the range of the compression ratio that does not degrade the ﬁnal performance
too much. To this end, we vary the number of clusters L and number of subvectors q in our proposed
method and report the resulting accuracy vs. compression trade-off in Figure 4. Note that we deﬁne
the compression ratio to be the ratio between the original activation size and compressed message
(codebook + codewords) size."
EXPERIMENTS,0.30158730158730157,"One can observe that the proposed method can achieve at least 10× compression ratio with almost
no accuracy loss. Furthermore, if we allow for 5% relative loss compared to SPLITFED, then our
method can achieve a 490× compression ratio on FEMNIST. This suggests that 99.8% information
is redundant and can be dropped during the up-link communication. Surprisingly, on SO Tag, the
Recall@5 even improves when adding the quantization layer. We conjecture that compressing the
outputs of a intermediate layer might have similar effects to dropout."
EXPERIMENTS,0.30423280423280424,"Overall Communication and Computation Efﬁciencies. Here, we provide a concrete example
showing how the proposed method improves the communication and computation efﬁciencies over
previous works. On FEMNIST, setting q = 1152 and L = 2 amounts to 490× compression ratio,
which amounts to a 490× reduction in the additional communication introduced by the network
splitting. Compared to SPLITFED, the overall up-link commutation cost (including the client-side
gradients synchronization) is about 10× smaller. Compared to FEDAVG, the up-link communication
cost per round is reduced by 62×, with 64× less trainable parameters on the clients. We further
compare the training curves with respect to total communication costs of FEDLITE against SPLITFED
and FEDAVG in Figure 6 in Appendix. Besides, the overall wall-clock time saving may depend on the
characteristics of the training system. One can get an estimate using the analytical model in (Agarwal

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.42063492063492064,"In this paper, we studied the problem of training large machine learning models in federated learning
setting with resource-constrained clients. Due to limitations on storage and/or compute capacity,
the clients cannot locally optimize the entire model. This prohibits the usage of previous federated
learning algorithms. Split neural network is a promising approach to address this issue, as it only
assigns the ﬁrst few (small) layers of a neural network to the clients. However, the network splitting
incurs additional communication. In order to make split neural network training to be communication-
efﬁcient, we propose an end-to-end training framework FEDLITE that can compress the additional
communication by up to 490× with minimal loss of accuracy. The success of our method relies
on a variant of product quantization scheme and a gradient correction technique. We perform
theoretical analysis as well as extensive experiments on both vision and language tasks to validate its
effectiveness."
