ABSTRACT,0.005813953488372093,"The ability to collect a large dataset of human preferences from text-to-image
users is usually limited to companies, making such datasets inaccessible to the
public. To address this issue, we create a web app that enables text-to-image
users to generate images and specify their preferences. Using this web app we
build Pick-a-Pic, a large, open dataset of text-to-image prompts and real users’
preferences over generated images. We leverage this dataset to train a CLIP-based
scoring function, PickScore, which exhibits superhuman performance on the task
of predicting human preferences. Then, we test PickScore’s ability to perform
model evaluation and observe that it correlates better with human rankings than
other automatic evaluation metrics. Therefore, we recommend using PickScore for
evaluating future text-to-image generation models, and using Pick-a-Pic prompts
as a more relevant dataset than MS-COCO. Finally, we demonstrate how PickScore
can enhance existing text-to-image models via ranking.1"

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.06395348837209303,"Recent advances in aligning language models with user behaviors and expectations have placed a
significant emphasis on the ability to model user preferences [10, 1, 3]. However, little attention has
been paid to this ability in the realm of text-to-image generation. This lack of attention can largely be
attributed to the absence of a large and open dataset of human preferences over state-of-the-art image
generation models."
INTRODUCTION,0.06976744186046512,"To fill this void, we create a web application that enables users to generate images using state-of-the-
art text-to-image models while specifying their preferences. With explicit consent from the users, we
collect their prompts and preferences to create Pick-a-Pic, a publicly available dataset comprising
over half-a-million examples of human preferences over model-generated images.2 Each example in
our dataset includes a prompt, two generated images, and a label indicating the preferred image, or a
tie when no image is significantly preferred over the other. Notably, Pick-a-Pic was created by real
users with a genuine interest in generating images. This interest differs from that of crowd workers
who lack the intrinsic motivation to produce creative prompts or the original intent of the prompt’s
author to judge which image better aligns with their needs."
INTRODUCTION,0.0755813953488372,"Tapping into authentic user preferences allows us to train a scoring function that estimates the user’s
satisfaction from a particular generated image given a prompt. To train such a scoring function
we finetune CLIP-H [12, 7] using human preference data and an analogous objective to that of
InstructGPT’s reward model [10]. This objective aims to maximize the probability of a preferred
image being picked over an unpreferred one, or even the probability in cases of a tie. We find that the
resulting scoring function, PickScore3, achieves superhuman performance in the task of predicting
user preferences (a 70.5% accuracy rate, compared to humans’ 68.0%), while zero-shot CLIP-H
(60.8%) and the popular aesthetics predictor [14] (56.8%) perform closer to chance (56.8%)."
INTRODUCTION,0.08139534883720931,"Equipped with a dataset for human preferences and a state-of-the-art scoring function, we propose
updating the standard protocol for evaluating text-to-image generation models. First, we suggest that
researchers evaluate their text-to-image models using prompts from Pick-a-Pic, which better represent
what humans want to generate than mundane captions, such as those found in MS-COCO [2, 9].
Second, to compare PickScore with FID, we conduct a human evaluation study and find that even
when evaluated against MS-COCO captions, PickScore exhibits a strong correlation with human
preferences (0.917), while ranking with FID yields a negative correlation (-0.900). Importantly, we
also compare PickScore with other evaluation metrics using model rankings inferred from real user
preferences. We observe that PickScore is more strongly correlated with ground truth rankings, as
determined by real users, than other evaluation metrics. Thus, we recommend using PickScore as a
more reliable evaluation metric than existing ones."
INTRODUCTION,0.0872093023255814,"Finally, we explore how PickScore can improve the quality of vanilla text-to-image models via
ranking. To accomplish this, we generate images with different initial random noises as well as
different templates (e.g. “breathtaking [prompt]. award-winning, professional, highly detailed”) to
slightly alter the user prompt. We then test the impact of selecting the top image according to different
scoring functions. Our findings indicate that human raters prefer images selected by PickScore more
than those selected by CLIP-H [7] (win rate of 71.3%), an aesthetics predictor [14] (win rate of
85.1%), and the vanilla text-to-image model (win rate of 71.4%)."
INTRODUCTION,0.09302325581395349,"In summary, the presented work addresses a gap in the field of text-to-image generation by creating a
large, open, high-quality dataset of human preferences over user-prompted model-generated images.
We demonstrate the potential of this dataset by training a scoring function, PickScore, which exhibits a
performance superior to any other publicly-available automatic scoring function, in predicting human
preferences, evaluating text-to-image models, and improving them via ranking. We encourage the
research community to adopt Pick-a-Pic and PickScore as a basis for further advances in text-to-image
modeling and incorporating human preferences into the learning process."

Pick-a-Pic Dataset"
PICK-A-PIC DATASET,0.12209302325581395,"The Pick-a-Pic dataset4 was created by logging user interactions with the Pick-a-Pic web application
for text-to-image generation. Overall, the Pick-a-Pic dataset contains over 500,000 examples and
35,000 distinct prompts. Each example contains a prompt, two generated images, and a label for
which image is preferred, or if there is a tie when no image is significantly preferred over the other.
The images in the dataset were generated by employing multiple backbone models, namely, Stable
Diffusion 2.1, Dreamlike Photoreal 2.05, and Stable Diffusion XL variants [13] while sampling
different classifier-free guidance scale values [6]. As we continue with our efforts to collect more user
interactions through the Pick-a-Pic web app and decrease the number of NSFW examples included in
the dataset, we will periodically upload new revisions of the dataset."
PICK-A-PIC DATASET,0.12790697674418605,"The Pick-a-Pic Web App
To ensure maximum accessibility for a wide range of users, the user
interface was designed with simplicity in mind. The application allows users to write creative prompts
and generate images. At each turn, the user is presented with two generated images (conditioned
on their prompt), and asked to select their preferred option or indicate a tie if they have no strong
preference. Upon selection, the rejected (non-preferred) image is replaced with a newly generated
image, and the process repeats. The user can also clear or edit the prompt at any time, and the app
will generate new images appropriately. Figure 2 illustrates the usage flow."
PICK-A-PIC DATASET,0.13372093023255813,"Real Data from Real Users
A key advantage of Pick-a-Pic is that our data is collected from real,
intrinsically-motivated users, rather than paid crowd workers. We achieve this by approaching a wide
audience through various social media channels such as Twitter, Facebook, Discord, and Reddit. At
the same time, we mitigate the risk of collecting low-quality data resulting from potential misuse
of the application by implementing several quality control measures. First, users are required to
authenticate their identity using either a Gmail or a Discord account.6 Second, we closely monitor
user activity logs and take action to ban users who generate NSFW content, use multiple instances
of the web app simultaneously, or make judgments at an unreasonably fast pace. Third, we use
a list of NSFW phrases to prevent users from generating harmful content. Last, we limit users to
1000 interactions and periodically increase the limit. These measures work in tandem to ensure the
integrity and reliability of Pick-a-Pic’s data."
PICK-A-PIC DATASET,0.13953488372093023,"Annotation Methodology
While piloting the web app, we experimented with different annotation
strategies to optimize for data quality, efficiency of collection, and user experience. Specifically, we
tested the following annotation options: (1) 4 images, no ties; (2) 2 images, no ties; (3) 2 images,"

PICK-A-PIC DATASET,0.19767441860465115,"Preprocessing
When processing the collected interactions, we filter prompts with NSFW phrases
and banned users. We acknowledge that there are still NSFW images and prompts, and will periodi-
cally attempt to update the dataset and reduce such occurrences. To divide the dataset into training,
validation, and testing subsets, we first sample one thousand prompts, ensuring that each prompt
was created by a unique user. Next, we randomly divide those prompts into two sets of equal size to
create the validation and test sets. We then sample exactly one example for each prompt to include in
these sets. For the training set, we include all examples that do not share a prompt with the validation
and test sets. This approach ensures that no split shares prompts with another split, and the validation
and test sets do not suffer from being non-proportionally fitted to a specific prompt or user."
PICK-A-PIC DATASET,0.20348837209302326,"Statistics
Since the creation of the Pick-a-Pic web app we have gathered 968,965 rankings which
originated from 66,798 prompts and 6,394 users. However, as the Pick-a-Pic dataset is constantly
updating, the reported experiments in this paper involve an NSFW filtered and not fully updated
version of Pick-a-Pic, that contains 583,747 training examples, and 500 validation and test examples.
The training set of this dataset contains 37,523 prompts from 4,375 distinct users."
PICK-A-PIC DATASET,0.20930232558139536,"Model Selection and Evaluation
The Pick-a-Pic dataset offers a unique opportunity for a model
selection and evaluation methodology, leveraging users’ preferences for unbiased analysis. To
illustrate this opportunity, we use the collected data and analyze the impact of changing the classifier-
free guidance scale of Stable Diffusion XL (Alpha variant) on its performance. Specifically, we
compare human preferences made when both images were generated by Stable Diffusion XL (Alpha
variant) but using different classifier-free guidance scales7. For each scale, we compute the win ratio,
representing the percentage of judgments where its use led to a preferred image. We also calculate the
corresponding tie and lose ratios for each scale, enabling a detailed analysis of which classifier-free
guidance scales are more effective. Our results are depicted in Figure 3 (a), and verify for example,
that a guidance scale of 9 usually yields preferred images when compared to a guidance scale of 3."
PICK-A-PIC DATASET,0.21511627906976744,"Furthermore, by examining user preferences between images generated by different backbone models,
we can determine which model is preferred more by users. For instance, considering judgments in
which one image was generated by Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0 and the other by Stable Diffusion 2.1, we
can evaluate which model is more performant. As shown in fig. 3 (b), users usually prefer Dreamlike
Photoreal 2.0 over Stable Diffusion 2.1. We encourage researchers to contact us and include their
text-to-image models in the Pick-a-Pic web app for the purpose of model selection and evaluation."

The input for our objective includes a scoring function s, a prompt x, two images

PREFERENCE PREDICTION,0.4476744186046512,"Table 1b shows that the aesthetics score (56.8) and CLIP-H (60.8) perform closer to a random
chance baseline (56.8), while PickScore (70.5 ± 0.142)10 achieves superhuman performance, as it
even outperforms human experts (68.0). It is important to emphasize a core difference between
real users that produce the ground truth labels and annotators used to evaluate human performance.
The users that produce the ground truth are actual text-to-image users, which have an idea (which
may be incomplete) for an image, and invent a prompt (which may lack details) with hope that
the resulting image will match their preferences. In contrast, annotators that are used to measure
human performance are oblivious to the original user’s context, idea, and motivation. Therefore,
superhuman performance on this task means that the model is able to outperform a human annotator
that is oblivious to the original user’s context, idea, and motivation. The superhuman performance of
PickScore showcases the importance of using real users as ground truth rather than expert annotators
when collecting human preferences. Moreover, the relatively modest human performance (68.0) on
the task, when compared to a random baseline (56.8), shows that predicting human preferences in
text-to-image generation is a difficult task for human annotators."

Model Evaluation"
MODEL EVALUATION,0.6627906976744186,"Despite significant progress in the generative capabilities of text-to-image models, the standard
and most popular prompt dataset has remained the Microsoft Common Objects in Context dataset
(MS-COCO) [9]. Similarly, the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [5] is still the main metric used for
model evaluation. In this section, we explain why we recommend researchers to evaluate their models
using prompts from Pick-a-Pic rather than (or at least alongside) MS-COCO, and show that when
evaluating state-of-the-art text-to-image models, PickScore is more aligned with human judgments
than other automatic evaluation metrics."
MODEL EVALUATION,0.6686046511627907,"Model Evaluation Prompts
The prompts contained in the MS-COCO dataset are captions of
photographs taken by amateur photographers, depicting objects and humans in everyday settings.
While certain captions within this dataset may pose a challenge to text-to-image models, it is evident
that the scope of interest for text-to-image users extends beyond commonplace objects and humans.
Moreover, the main use-case of image generation is arguably to generate fiction, which cannot be
captured by camera. By construction, Pick-a-Pic’s prompts are sampled from real users, and thus
better represent the natural distribution of text-to-image intents. We therefore strongly advocate
that the research community employ prompts from Pick-a-Pic when assessing the performance of
text-to-image models."
MODEL EVALUATION,0.6744186046511628,"FID
The FID metric [5] gauges the degree of resemblance between a set of generated images and a
set of authentic images, at the set level. To do so, it first embeds the real and generated images into"
MODEL EVALUATION,0.6802325581395349,"the feature space of an Inception net [15], and then estimates the mean and covariance of both sets of
images and calculates their similarity. FID is thus geared towards measuring the realism of a set of
images, but is oblivious to the prompts. In contrast, PickScore provides a per-instance score, and is
directly conditioned on the prompt. We thus hypothesize that PickScore will correlate better with
human judgements of generation quality."
MODEL EVALUATION,0.686046511627907,"To empirically test our hypothesis with the most “convenient” settings for the FID metric, we select
100 random captions from MS-COCO validation split. For each caption, we generate images from 9
different models based on the same set of prompts, and ask human experts to rank the 9 generated
images (with ties), inducing pairwise preferences. Specifically, we use Stable Diffusion 1.5, Stable
Diffusion 2.1, and Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0 combined with three different classifier-free guidance
scales (3, 6, and 9). We then repeat the labeling process (over the same images) using FID, and
PickScore instead of humans to determine preferences. Since FID does not operate on a per-example
base, when “labeling” with FID, we simply choose the model that has a lower (better) FID score on
MS-COCO."
MODEL EVALUATION,0.6918604651162791,"Figure 6 shows the correlation between model win rates induced by human rankings (horizontal) and
model win rates induced by each automatic scoring function. PickScore exhibits a stronger correlation
(0.917) with human raters on MS-COCO captions than FID (-0.900), which surprisingly, exhibits a
strong negative correlation. As FID is oblivious to the prompt, one would expect zero correlation, and
not a strong negative correlation. We hypothesize that this is related to the classifier-free guidance
scale hyperparameter – larger scales tend to produce more vivid images (which humans typically
prefer), but differ from the distribution of ground truth images in MS-COCO, yielding worse (higher)
FID scores. Figure 5 visualizes these differences by presenting pairs of images generated with the
same random seed but with different classifier-free guidance (CFG) scales."
MODEL EVALUATION,0.6976744186046512,"Other Evaluation Metrics
When comparing with evaluation metrics that do not assume a set of
ground truth images, we are able to use a more reliable evaluation procedure. In this evaluation
procedure, we consider real user preferences rather than human annotators, as well as more models
(i.e. more data points). Specifically, we take all the 14,000 collected preferences that correspond to
prompts from the Pick-a-Pic test set. This set of examples contains images generated by 45 different
models – four different backbone models, each with different guidance scales. We then use these real
user preferences to calculate Elo ratings [4] for the different models. Afterward, we repeat the process
while replacing the real user preferences with CLIP-H [7], and PickScore predictions. Similarly to
Section 4, we also compare against the concurrent work from ImageReward[18] and HPS [17]. Since
the Elo rating system is iterative by nature, we repeat the process 50 times. Each time we randomly
shuffle the order of examples, and calculate the correlation with human ratings. Finally, for each
metric, we output the mean and standard deviation of its 50 corresponding correlations. Figure 7
displays the correlation between real users’ Elo ratings with the different metrics’ rating, showing
that PickScore exhibits a stronger correlation (0.790 ± 0.054) with real users than all other automatic
metrics, namely CLIP-H (0.313 ± 0.075), ImageReward (0.492 ± 0.086), and HPS (0.670 ± 0.071)."

Text-to-Image Ranking"
TEXT-TO-IMAGE RANKING,0.7093023255813954,"Another possible application for scoring functions is improving the performance of generations made
by text-to-image models through ranking: generate a sample of images, and select the one with
the highest score. To test this approach, we generate one hundred images for each prompt of the
one hundred prompts we take from the Pick-a-Pic test set. We generate the images with Dreamlike
Photoreal 2.0, using a classifier-free guidance scale of 7.5, and to increase image diversity, we use 5
initial random noises and 20 different prompt templates. These templates include the null template
“[prompt]” and other templates like “breathtaking [prompt]. award-winning, professional, highly
detailed”. From each set of 100 generated images, we select the best one according to PickScore,
CLIP-H, the aesthetics score, or randomly; in addition, we randomly select one image from the null
template for control. We then ask expert human annotators to compare PickScore’s chosen image to
each of the other functions’ choices, and decide which one they prefer."

Related Work"
RELATED WORK,0.7790697674418605,"Collecting and learning from human preferences is an active area of research in natural language
processing (NLP) [3, 1, 10]. However, in the domain of text-to-image generation, related research
questions have received little attention. One notable work that focuses on collecting human judgments
in text-to-image generation is the Simulacra Aesthetic Captions (SAC) dataset [11]. This dataset
contains almost 200,000 human ratings of generated images. However, unlike Pick-a-Pic which
focuses on general user preferences, and allows users to compare between generated images, the
human raters of SAC provide an absolute score for the aesthetic quality of the generated images."
RELATED WORK,0.7848837209302325,"There has been some concurrent work that involves collection and learning from human preferences
that we describe below. Lee et al. [8] consider three simple categories of challenges (count, color,
and background), enumerating through templates (e.g. “[number] dogs”) to synthetically create
prompts. Then, they instruct crowd workers to choose if a generated image is good or bad and use
the collected 30,000 examples to train a scoring function. In contrast, Pick-a-Pick allows real users to
write any prompts they choose, and provide pairwise comparisons between images that yield more
than 500,000 examples."
RELATED WORK,0.7906976744186046,"ImageReward [18] selects prompts and images from the DiffusionDB dataset [16], and collects for
them image preference ratings via crowd workers. Since they employ crowd workers that lack the
intrinsic motivation to select images that they prefer, the authors define criteria to assess the quality
of generated images and instruct crowd workers to follow these criteria when ranking images. They
use this strategy to collect 136,892 examples which originate from 8,878 prompts. Importantly, they
have not publicly released this dataset. For completeness, we tested ImageReward on the Pick-a-Pic
dataset and confirmed that PickScore outperforms it."
RELATED WORK,0.7965116279069767,"Another concurrent work from Wu et al. [17] collects a dataset of human judgments by scraping about
25,000 human ratings (which include about 100,000 images) from the Discord channel of StabilityAI.
Similarly to us, they use an objective analogous to that of InstructGPT to train a scoring function that
they name Human Preference Score (HPS). As with ImageReward, we evaluated HPS on Pick-a-Pic
and saw that PickScore achieves better performance."
RELATED WORK,0.8023255813953488,"The observed superior performance of PickScore over the concurrent work from both HPS and
ImageReward on the Pick-a-Pic dataset could be attributed to several factors. For example, differences
in implementation (e.g., model size, backbone, hyperparameters), differences in the scales of data, or
variations in the distribution of data. Notably, Pick-a-Pic is more than five times larger than the data
used to train HPS and ImageReward. Furthermore, ImageReward collects judgments from crowd
workers, which may lead to significant differences in data distribution. In contrast, HPS scrapes
ratings from the StabilityAI discord channel for real text-to-image users but may be more aligned
with this more specific distribution of text-to-image users. We leave Isolating and identifying the
specific effects of these factors for future work."

Limitations and Broader Impact"
LIMITATIONS AND BROADER IMPACT,0.813953488372093,"It is important to acknowledge that despite our efforts to ensure data quality (see section 2), some
images and prompts may contain NSFW content that could potentially bias the data, and some
users may have made judgments without due care. Moreover, the preferences of users may include
biases that may be reflected in the collected data. These limitations may affect the overall quality
and reliability of the data collected and should be taken into consideration when considering the
broader impact of the dataset. Nonetheless, we believe that the advantages of collecting data from
intrinsically-motivated users and publicly releasing it will enable the text-to-image community to
better align text-to-image models with human preferences."

Conclusions"
CONCLUSIONS,0.8255813953488372,"We build a web application that serves text-to-image users and (willingly) collects their preferences.
We use the collected data and present the Pick-a-Pic dataset: an open dataset of over half-a-million
examples of text-to-image prompts, generated images, and user-labeled preferences. The quantity and
quality of the data enables us to train PickScore, a state-of-the-art text-image scoring function, which
achieves superhuman performance when predicting user preferences. PickScore aligns better with
human judgements than any other publicly-available automatic metric, and together with Pick-a-Pic’s
natural distribution prompts, enables much more relevant text-to-image model evaluation than existing
evaluation standards, such as FID over MS-COCO. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using
our scoring function for selecting images in improving the quality of text-to-image models. There
are still many opportunities for building upon Pick-a-Pic and PickScore, such as RLHF and other
alignment approaches, and we are excited to see how the research community will utilize this work in
the near future."
