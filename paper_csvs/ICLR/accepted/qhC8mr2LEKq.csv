ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.004048582995951417,"Many approaches to program synthesis perform a search within an enormous
space of programs to ﬁnd one that satisﬁes a given speciﬁcation. Prior works have
used neural models to guide combinatorial search algorithms, but such approaches
still explore a huge portion of the search space and quickly become intractable as
the size of the desired program increases. To tame the search space blowup, we
propose training a neural model to learn a hands-on search policy for bottom-up
synthesis, instead of relying on a combinatorial search algorithm. Our approach,
called CROSSBEAM, uses the neural model to choose how to combine previously-
explored programs into new programs, taking into account the search history and
partial program executions. Motivated by work in structured prediction on learn-
ing to search, CROSSBEAM is trained on-policy using data extracted from its own
bottom-up searches on training tasks. We evaluate CROSSBEAM in two very dif-
ferent domains, string manipulation and logic programming. We observe that
CROSSBEAM learns to search efﬁciently, exploring much smaller portions of the
program space compared to the state-of-the-art."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.012145748987854251,"Program synthesis is the problem of automatically constructing source code from a speciﬁcation of
what that code should do (Manna & Waldinger, 1971; Gulwani et al., 2017). Program synthesis has
been long dogged by the combinatorial search for a program satisfying the speciﬁcation—while it
is easy to write down input-output examples of what a program should do, actually ﬁnding such
a program requires exploring the exponentially large, discrete space of code. Thus, a natural ﬁrst
instinct is to learn to guide these combinatorial searches, which has been successful for other discrete
search spaces such as game trees and integer linear programs (Anthony et al., 2017; Nair et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.016194331983805668,"This work proposes and evaluates a new neural network approach for learning to search for pro-
grams, called CROSSBEAM1, based on several hypotheses. First, learning to search works best
when it exploits the symbolic scaffolding of existing search algorithms already proven useful for
the problem domain. For example, AlphaGo exploits Monte Carlo Tree Search (Silver et al., 2016),
while NGDS exploits top-down deductive search (Kalyan et al., 2018). We engineer CROSSBEAM
around bottom-up enumerative search (Udupa et al., 2013), a backbone of several successful recent
program synthesis algorithms (Shi et al., 2020a; Odena et al., 2021; Barke et al., 2020). Bottom-
up search is particularly appealing because it captures the intuition that a programmer can write
small subprograms ﬁrst and then combine them to get the desired solution. Essentially, a model can
learn to do a soft version of a divide-and-conquer strategy for synthesis. Furthermore, bottom-up
search enables execution of subprograms during search, which is much more difﬁcult in a top-down
approach where partial programs may have unsynthesized portions that impede execution."

the inputs and constants. It repeatedly loops over all DSL operations, and for each operation, the
model takes the search context and produces argument lists for that operation, choosing among the
previously-explored values. Executing the operation on the argument lists produces new values."
INTRODUCTION,0.08502024291497975,"Second, the learned model should take a “hands-on” role during search, meaning that the learned
model should be extensively queried to provide guidance. This allows the search to maximally ex-
ploit the learned heuristics, thus reducing the effective branching factor and the exponential blowup.
This is in contrast to previous methods that run the model only once per problem (Shi et al., 2020a;
Balog et al., 2017), or repeatedly but at lower frequency (Barke et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.08906882591093117,"Third, learning methods should take the global search context into account. When the model is
choosing which part of the search space to explore further, its decision should depend not only on
recent decisions, but on the full history of what programs have already been explored and their exe-
cution results. This is in contrast to hill-climbing or genetic programming approaches that only keep
the “best” candidate programs found so far (Schkufza et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2019), or approaches
that prune or downweight individual candidate programs without larger search context (Zohar &
Wolf, 2018; Odena et al., 2021). Search context can be powerful because one subprogram of the
solution may not seem useful initially, but its utility may become more apparent after other use-
ful subprograms are discovered, enabling them to be combined. Additionally, the model can learn
context-speciﬁc heuristics, for example, to combine smaller expressions for more breadth earlier in
the search, and combining larger expressions when the model predicts that it is closer to a solution."
INTRODUCTION,0.0931174089068826,"Combining these ideas yields CROSSBEAM, a bottom-up search method for programming by ex-
ample (Figure 1). At every iteration, the algorithm maintains a search context that contains all of
the programs considered so far during search, as well as their execution results. New programs are
generated by combining previously-explored programs chosen by a pointer network (Vinyals et al.,
2015). The model is trained on-policy using beam-aware training (Negrinho et al., 2018; 2020), i.e.,
the training algorithm actually runs the CROSSBEAM search, and the loss function encourages the
model to progress towards the correct program instead of other candidates proposed by the model.
This avoids the potential problems of distribution shift that can arise if the search model is trained
off-policy, as in previous works for learning-based synthesis (Devlin et al., 2017; Odena et al., 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.09716599190283401,"On two different domains, we ﬁnd that CROSSBEAM signiﬁcantly improves over state-of-the-art
methods. In the string manipulation domain, CROSSBEAM solves 62% more tasks within 50K
candidate expressions than BUSTLE (Odena et al., 2021) on the same test sets used in the BUSTLE
paper. In inductive logic programming, CROSSBEAM achieves nearly 100% success rate on tasks
with large enough solutions that prior state-of-the-art has a 0% success rate."

CROSSBEAM OVERVIEW,0.10526315789473684,"In this section we provide an overview of CROSSBEAM, leaving model and training details to Sec-
tion 3. In our task of program synthesis from input/output examples, we have a domain-speciﬁc
language (DSL) L describing a space of programs, and a set of example inputs I = {I1, . . . , IN}
and corresponding outputs O = {O1, . . . , ON}. The goal is to ﬁnd a program P ∈L such that
P(Ii) = Oi for all i ∈{1 . . . N}. The DSL L describes atomic values (constants and input vari-
ables) and operations that can be applied to arguments to produce new values. Programs in L are
arbitrarily-nested compositions of operations applied to atomic values or other such compositions."

CROSSBEAM OVERVIEW,0.12955465587044535,"and DSL constants. For each program, the algorithm stores the value that results from executing the
program on the inputs. Then, at each iteration of search, it enumerates all programs of the given
target size, which amounts to enumerating all ways of choosing a DSL operation and choosing its
arguments from previously-explored values, such that the resulting program typechecks and has the
target size. Each candidate program results in a new value, which is added to the set of explored
values if it is not semantically equivalent (with respect to the I/O examples) to an existing value.
Values constructed in this way store the operation and argument list used. Once we encounter a value
that is semantically equivalent to the example outputs, we have found a solution and can recursively
reconstruct its code representation. This search algorithm is complete, but the search space grows
exponentially so it quickly becomes intractable as the size of the solution program grows."
CROSSBEAM OVERVIEW,0.13360323886639677,"CROSSBEAM Algorithm. To combat the exponential blowup of the search space, the CROSSBEAM
approach (Figure 1, Algorithm 1) uses a neural model in place of complete enumeration in the basic
bottom-up search. We still build a set of explored values, but we no longer enumerate all argument
lists nor consider programs strictly in order of expression size. Instead, the model determines which
programs to explore next, that is, which previously-explored values to combine in order to generate
the next candidate program. More speciﬁcally, we repeatedly loop over all operations in the DSL.
For each operation, the model takes as input the entire search context, including the I/O examples,
the current operation, and the set S of previously-explored values. The model deﬁnes a distribution
over argument lists for the operation, in the form of pointers to existing values in S. From this
distribution, we can draw argument lists from the model using sampling or beam search, to produce
candidate programs. Finally, we execute each of the candidate programs and add the resulting values
to S, with pruning of semantically-equivalent values as in the basic bottom-up search. The search
continues until a solution is found or the search budget is exhausted."
CROSSBEAM OVERVIEW,0.13765182186234817,"UniqueRandomizer. We use beam search to draw argument lists from the model during training.
Because the model may choose the same argument list for the same operation in different iterations
of search, the search algorithm may stall if no new values are explored. This is especially problem-
atic during evaluation, where we may search for a long time. Therefore, during evaluation, instead
of beam search we use UniqueRandomizer (Shi et al., 2020b), which draws distinct samples from
a sequence model incrementally by storing the previous samples in a trie so as to avoid duplicates.
Using UniqueRandomizer, we draw distinct samples (argument lists) until we produce K values that
have not been seen yet, up to a budget of λ · K samples per operation per iteration, where K is the
“beam size” and λ is a hyperparameter describing how hard we should try to produce K new values.
During evaluation in our experiments, we set K = λ = 10."

MODEL DETAILS"
MODEL DETAILS,0.2834008097165992,"Our neural model for CROSSBEAM is a policy for bottom-up search. It takes as input an operation
in the DSL and a search context, and outputs a distribution over argument lists for the operation, in
the form of pointers to previously-explored values. The model has four components (Figure 2): (1)
the I/O module, (2) the value module, (3) the search context summary module and (4) the argument
selector module. For different domains one can make different design choices for these modules.
For example, in the string manipulation domain, we leverage property signatures (Odena & Sutton,
2020) in the same way as in BUSTLE (Odena et al., 2021), and for the logic programming domain,
we propose two variants based on the MLP or GREAT Transformer (Hellendoorn et al., 2019)
architectures. Below we present the generic design of these modules; for details, see Appendix A."
MODEL DETAILS,0.2874493927125506,"I/O module. The I/O module takes the input-output examples (I, O) as input and produces a
d-dimensional vector representation eIO ∈Rd that summarizes the speciﬁcation. Depending on
the application domain, one can use RNNs (Devlin et al., 2017), property signatures (Odena &
Sutton, 2020), or other domain-speciﬁc approaches to embed the I/O example into eIO."
MODEL DETAILS,0.291497975708502,"Value module. The value module embeds the set of explored values S into a matrix ES ∈R|S|×d.
The i-th row of the matrix, ESi, is the embedding of the i-th explored value Vi ∈S. Each value
embedding ESi = si + zi sums up two components. First, si is a domain-speciﬁc embedding that
can be implemented differently for different domains, but likely using similar techniques as the I/O
module. Second, a size embedding zi makes the search procedure aware of the “cost” of the value
Vi. To implement this, we compute min{size(Vi), ms} and look it up in an embedding matrix in
Rms×d to get the size embedding zi, where ms is a maximum size cutoff for embedding purposes."
MODEL DETAILS,0.29554655870445345,"Search context summary module. This module summarizes the search context, which includes
the set of explored values S, the I/O examples (I, O), and the current operation op, into a vector
representation ec ∈Rd. The search context summary ec would then be given to the argument
selector module. Since the cardinality of S changes during the search procedure, and it should be
permutation-invariant by nature, we can use an approach like DeepSets (Zaheer et al., 2017) to get
a summary es for ES. In particular, we set es to be the max-pooling over ES across the values. We
then obtain ec = MLPop([es, eIO]) via an operation-speciﬁc MLP on top of the concatenation of
the value embedding summary es and the I/O embedding eIO."

is designed to pick the most likely sequences of arguments in the combinatorially large space of size

MODEL DETAILS,0.3076923076923077,"eration is typically small, we can use an autoregressive model (in our case an autoregressive LSTM)
to approximately output the argument list with maximum likelihood with O(|S| × op.arity) cost.
This also allows us to perform beam search to approximately select the K most likely combinations
of arguments. Our LSTM uses the search context summary ec as the initial hidden state. At each
argument selection step t ∈{1, . . . , op.arity} we use the LSTM’s output gate ht ∈Rd to select
the argument from S. Unlike in the language modeling case where the decoding space is given by a
ﬁxed vocabulary, here we have a growing vocabulary S. Inspired by pointer networks (Vinyals et al.,"

MODEL DETAILS,0.3157894736842105,"not all values are type compatible for the t-th argument of operation op, we mask out infeasible
values before computing p(Vi | ht, S). After the model selects a certain argument at ∈S at step
t, the LSTM updates the hidden states with the embedding ESat and proceeds with the next step if
t < op.arity, or stops if we have obtained an entire argument list for op."
MODEL DETAILS,0.31983805668016196,"Training. Unlike typical supervised learning, our model uses context that results from searching
according to the model. One approach is to provide supervision for how the model should proceed
given a randomly-generated search context. However, the resulting distribution shift could lead to
inferior generalization. Thus, we instead train the model on-policy, where we run the model in
a search to produce realistic search contexts for training. Because the training data includes the
model’s previous decisions in the search context, the model learns to correctly continue the search,
e.g., extending promising search directions or recovering from mistakes."
MODEL DETAILS,0.32388663967611336,"The overall training algorithm can be found in Algorithm 1. The main idea is that we run search
during training and collect supervised training examples for the model as it searches. Given a task
speciﬁed by (I, O) with a ground-truth program P, we create a trace T, which is a list of steps
the search should take to construct P in a bottom-up fashion. Each element T[i] ∈T contains an
operation T[i].op and an argument list T[i].arglist that builds one node of the abstract syntax tree
for P. Then, in each search step with context S where we are considering the operation T[i].op, we
collect a training example with input (S, T[i].op, I, O) and target T[i].arglist. Note that we do not
make a separate copy of S for each training example, but rather we record the current size of S and
refer to the ﬁnal S for each task, since |S| grows monotonically during the search. During the search
we also add T[i] to S, so that we may construct correct argument lists involving T[i] in future steps.
We use collected training examples to train the model using standard maximum likelihood training."
MODEL DETAILS,0.32793522267206476,"Note that T is not necessarily unique for a given program P, because the syntax tree for P could
be linearized in different orders. In this case, we sample a ground-truth trace randomly from the
possible orderings. We denote T ≡P if T is a possible trace of P. We then formulate the training
loss as the expectation of the negative log-likelihood of the ground-truth argument lists under the
corresponding search context and current model parameters θ:"

use a technique from prior work (Shi et al., 2020a; Odena et al., 2021) where we run the bottom-up
enumerative search starting from different random inputs, randomly selecting explored values to
serve as target outputs. Even though CROSSBEAM is trained using randomly-generated tasks, our
experiments show that it still performs well on realistic test tasks. We train CROSSBEAM with a
distributed synchronized Adam optimizer on 8 V100 GPUs, with gradient accumulation of 4 for an
effective batch size of 32. We generate 10M training tasks for string manipulation and 1M for logic
programming. The models train for at most 500K steps or 5 days, whichever limit is reached ﬁrst.
We use K = 10 and learning rate 1 × 10−4 during training. After every 10K training steps, we
evaluate on synthetic validation tasks to choose the best model."

See Appendix B for details. The BUSTLE approach extends the same enumerative bottom-up search
as CROSSBEAM, but BUSTLE trains a neural model to predict how useful values are (i.e., whether
a value is a subexpression of a solution) and prioritizes values during the search accordingly. BUS-
TLE is still a complete enumerative search and will eventually explore the entire space of programs
in the DSL, and thus it still suffers from the issue of search space blowup, albeit to a much lesser
degree than plain enumeration. In contrast, CROSSBEAM trades off completeness for exploration
efﬁciency, as we have no guarantee that the model will eventually explore the entire search space."

Because CROSSBEAM is not deterministic due to sampling argument lists with UniqueRandomizer,
we run it 5 times and plot the mean, minimum, and maximum performance."
STRING MANIPULATION,0.3765182186234818,"We borrow the following comparisons and results from the BUSTLE paper. (1) BUSTLE refers to
the best approach in the paper, i.e., using both the model and heuristics. (2) The baseline bottom-up
enumerative search is the same as described in Section 2. (3) RobustFill (Devlin et al., 2017) is
an LSTM that predicts end-to-end from the I/O examples to the program tokens. For RobustFill, a
“candidate program” is one unique sample from the generative model, obtained via beam search and
ordered by decreasing likelihood. (4) DeepCoder-style (Balog et al., 2017) premise selection uses a
neural model to predict which DSL operations will be used given the I/O examples. The least likely
operations according to the model are removed, and then the baseline bottom-up search is run."
STRING MANIPULATION,0.3805668016194332,"Figure 3 shows that CROSSBEAM signiﬁcantly outperforms the other methods on both sets of bench-
marks, on average solving 36.4 more problems in total compared to BUSTLE (an improvement of
62%). In fact, in order to match BUSTLE’s performance after 50,000 candidate programs, CROSS-
BEAM considers about 20× fewer candidate programs. CROSSBEAM still outperforms BUSTLE
when using a much larger budget of 1 million candidate programs (Appendix C). Thus, we con-
clude that CROSSBEAM explores the search space much more efﬁciently than the prior approaches."
STRING MANIPULATION,0.38461538461538464,"Ablations. We perform an ablation study to quantify the effects of training the model on-policy and

the model would produce during evaluation. Hence, this variation trains the model off-policy."

INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROGRAMMING"
INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROGRAMMING,0.4534412955465587,"Inductive Logic Programming or ILP (Cropper et al., 2021) is the program synthesis problem of
learning logical relations (predicates) from examples, which we specify with truth tables. Here,
these predicates are represented by logic programs (Prolog or Datalog; see Bratko (2001)) expressing
ﬁrst-order logical statements with quantiﬁed variables and recursion. ILP systems have been used
to make inferences over large knowledge graphs (Muggleton & Lin, 2013), do programming-by-
example (Lin et al., 2014), and perform common sense reasoning (Katz et al., 2008)."
INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROGRAMMING,0.4574898785425101,"Search in ILP is especially difﬁcult when the learned programs can be recursive, and when they can
deﬁne auxiliary “invented” predicates (analogous to deﬁning helper subroutines). As such, most ILP
systems limit themselves to learning a handful of logical clauses, and many forego either recursion
or predicate invention. We apply CROSSBEAM to ILP with the goal of synthesizing larger programs
with both recursion and predicate invention. We ﬁrst deﬁne a DSL over predicates (Figure 4) that
works by building larger predicates out of smaller ones, starting from primitive predicates computing
successorship, equality, and the “zero” predicate. Because CROSSBEAM executes every partially-
constructed program, we think of each predicate as evaluating to the set of tuples of entities for
which the predicate is true. To ensure this set remains small, we bound the arity of synthesized
predicates (arity ≤2) and work with entities in a relatively small domain of numbers in {0, . . . , 9}."
INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROGRAMMING,0.46153846153846156,"We study CROSSBEAM’s ILP abilities by synthesizing both randomly-generated and handcrafted
predicates from examples, with the goal of answering the questions of whether the system can per-
form predicate invention, whether it can learn recursive programs, and how it compares to state-of-
the-art ILP systems. Our synthetic test set contains tasks of varying size, i.e., the minimum number
of nodes in the expression tree of a solution. For each size in {5, . . . , 19}, we randomly select 50
tasks among all possible tasks of that size, excluding those appearing in the training dataset.2 Our
handcrafted test set, inspired by Peano arithmetic, comprises 30 common mathematical relation-
ships, e.g., whether a number is even, or if a number is greater than another. For each synthesis task,
the system is given every positive/negative example for numbers in {0, . . . , 9} as a truth table."
INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROGRAMMING,0.46558704453441296,"We run CROSSBEAM with either a MLP- or Transformer-based value encoder for predicates (see
Appendix A.2). We compare with the classic Metagol (Muggleton & Lin, 2013), a state-of-the-art
system Popper (Cropper & Morel, 2021a), and the basic bottom-up enumerative search. We run all
methods for a time limit of 30 seconds per task. CROSSBEAM signiﬁcantly outperforms all of the
other methods in both test sets. We summarize our ﬁndings here with more details in Appendix E."
INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROGRAMMING,0.46963562753036436,"Figure 5 shows the results on the randomly-generated test set, where CROSSBEAM achieves close
to 100% success rate on tasks up to size 16 and over 50% success rate on tasks up to size 19,
while the success rates of all other methods drop to 0% by size 13. This is evidence that CROSS-
BEAM is a major forward step in tackling the issue of search space explosion. For the handcrafted
tasks, CROSSBEAM achieves a 93% success rate, versus a 60% success rate for Metagol and Popper
(Figure 7 in Appendix E). CROSSBEAM also does not appear to struggle with recursion (every hand-
crafted task can only be solved with recursion) and consistently solves problems requiring predicate"

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.4939271255060729,"Machine learning for program synthesis has been an active area (Gottschlich et al., 2018; Gulwani
et al., 2017; Allamanis et al., 2018). For example, DeepCoder (Balog et al., 2017) uses a learned
model to select useful operations once at the beginning of search. Although this idea is pragmatic,
the disadvantage is that once the search has started, the model can give no further feedback. Odena
& Sutton (2020) use property signatures within a DeepCoder-style model for premise selection."
RELATED WORK,0.4979757085020243,"Many learning based approaches to synthesis can be viewed as using learning to guide search. Some
methods employ models that emit programs token-by-token (Bunel et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2017;
Parisotto et al., 2017), which can be interpreted as using learning to guide beam search. Recent
versions of this idea use large pretrained language models to generate programs (Chen et al., 2021;
Austin et al., 2021). Rubin & Berant (2021) builds a semi-autoregressive bottom-up generative
model for semantic parsing, where the beam decoding is embedded in the model decoding to achieve
logarithmic runtime. Alternately, top-down search can be guided by learning with a syntax guided
search over programs (Yin & Neubig, 2017; Lee et al., 2018). Another line of work uses learning to
guide a two-level search by ﬁrst generating a sketch of the program (Nye et al., 2019; Murali et al.,
2018) or latent representation (Hong et al., 2021). None of this work uses execution information to
guide the search, or uses the rich information from the search context, as CROSSBEAM does."
RELATED WORK,0.5020242914979757,"Execution-guided neural synthesis methods use the results of executing partial programs to guide
search, which is a powerful source of information. Zohar & Wolf (2018) learns to write straight-
line code line-by-line, and to ignore (“garbage collect”) lines deemed irrelevant to further search.
A similar approach is to rewrite a programming language so that it can be evaluated “left-to-right,”
allowing values to be used to prioritize a tree search in a reinforcement learning framework (Ellis
et al., 2019). Similarly, Chen et al. (2019) use intermediate values while synthesizing a program us-
ing a neural encoder-decoder model, but again this work proceeds in a variant of left-to-right search
that is modiﬁed to handle conditionals and loops. To illustrate the potential differences between
left-to-right and bottom-up methods, imagine that the correct program is f(A,B), where A and
B are arbitrary subprograms. Then if a left-to-right search makes a mistake in generating A, that
search branch will never recover. In contrast, because bottom-up search maintains a population of
many partial programs, it can build up subprograms A and B roughly independently. While all these
execution-guided methods have “hands-on” neural models, our approach differs by looking at the
global search context—and it learns to do so effectively because it learns on-policy."
RELATED WORK,0.5060728744939271,"Our string domain is inspired by the symbolic synthesizer FlashFill (Gulwani, 2011) and subsequent
work on learning-based synthesis for string manipulation (Menon et al., 2013; Odena et al., 2021).
Our use of imitation to guide search is inspired by work in learning to search (Daum´e III et al., 2009;
Ross et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2015) and beam-aware training (Negrinho et al., 2018; 2020)."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5141700404858299,"CROSSBEAM combines several powerful ideas for learning-guided program synthesis.
First,
bottom-up search provides a symbolic scaffolding that enables execution of subprograms during
search, which provides an important source of information for the model. Second, the learned model
takes a “hands-on” role during search, having sufﬁcient freedom to manage the effective branching
factor of search. Third, the model takes the search context into account, building a continuous rep-
resentation of the results of all programs generated so far. Finally, training examples are generated
on-policy during search, so that the model learns correct followups for its previous decisions. Our
experiments show that this is an effective combination: in the string manipulation domain, CROSS-
BEAM solves 62% more tasks than BUSTLE, and in the logic domain, CROSSBEAM achieves nearly
100% success rate on difﬁcult tasks where prior methods have a 0% success rate."

“does the string contain digits,” “is the integer negative,” and “is the ﬁrst string a substring of the
second.” We use the same set of properties as used in BUSTLE. Given a set of properties and one
or two values to featurize, we can compute whether that property is always true across examples,
always false across examples, sometimes true and sometimes false, or not applicable (due to type
mismatch). By evaluating all properties on a value and its relationship to the target output, we obtain
a property signature used in the I/O module and the value module."

MODEL DESIGN FOR LOGIC PROGRAMMING"

of entities {0, . . . , 9}. We think of each such predicate as computing a binary-valued tensor with
shape (10, ) for arity-1 predicates, or (10, 10) for arity-2 predicates. Both the I/O speciﬁcation and
program values are modeled as tensors of these shapes. For the I/O module and the value module,
we consider two different architectures for encoding these tensors."

to have length 100 (as binary relations can have size 10 × 10 = 100), and prepends a single binary
variable indicating the arity of the relation. The resulting 101-dimensional object is processed by a
4-layer MLP with 512 hidden units and ReLU activations."

WALLCLOCK TIME COMPARISON IN THE STRING DOMAIN"
REFERENCES,0.8825910931174089,"Despite CROSSBEAM’s impressive performance when controlling for the number of expressions
considered, CROSSBEAM does not quite beat BUSTLE when we control for wallclock time. Note
that CROSSBEAM is implemented in Python, while for BUSTLE we use the authors’ Java implemen-
tation, which is faster in general than Python. To get a rough sense of the impact, we implemented
the baseline bottom-up search in Python and found that it obtains very similar synthesis performance
as the Java implementation from BUSTLE when controlling for the number of candidate programs
considered, but the Python version is about 9× slower than the Java one: our Python baseline solves
74 total tasks within 30 seconds, and the Java baseline solves 74 tasks within 3.4 seconds (but
73 in 3.3 seconds, and 75 in 3.5 seconds). This serves as a reference point for the difference in
speed between the languages, but since no neural models are involved in the baselines, it is not di-
rectly applicable to the CROSSBEAM versus BUSTLE time comparison which does involve models.
Nevertheless, Table 1 compares Python implementations with a 30 second time limit versus Java
implementations with a 3.4 second time limit."
REFERENCES,0.8866396761133604,"Even when we do our best to adjust the time limits fairly, BUSTLE still solves more tasks than
CROSSBEAM. However, the original BUSTLE implementation has other optimizations: the BUSTLE
model has a simple and small architecture, the method was designed to enable batching of the
model predictions, operations in the string manipulation domain are extremely quick to execute,
and the entire system is implemented in Java. In contrast, CROSSBEAM is implemented in Python,
and our work as a whole is more focused on searching efﬁciently in terms of candidate programs
explored instead of wallclock time, favoring improvements in deep learning methodology and ease
of iteration on modeling ideas over runtime speed. In CROSSBEAM, batching model predictions
for all operations in an iteration and batching the UniqueRandomizer sampling are both feasible but
challenging engineering hurdles that would lead to speedups, but are currently not implemented."
