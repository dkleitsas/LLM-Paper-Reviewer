ABSTRACT,0.0016501650165016502,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0033003300330033004,"Model-based reinforcement learning provides an efficient mechanism to find the
optimal policy by interacting with the learned environment. In addition to treat-
ing the learned environment like a black-box simulator, a more effective way to
use the model is to exploit its differentiability. Such methods require the gra-
dient information of the learned environment model when calculating the policy
gradient. However, since the error of gradient is not considered in the model
learning phase, there is no guarantee for the model’s accuracy. To address this
problem, we first analyze the convergence rate for the policy optimization meth-
ods when the policy gradient is calculated using the learned environment model.
The theoretical results show that the model gradient error matters in the policy
optimization phrase. Then we propose a two-model-based learning method to
control the prediction error and the gradient error. We separate the different roles
of these two models at the model learning phase and coordinate them at the pol-
icy optimization phase. After proposing the method, we introduce the directional
derivative projection policy optimization (DDPPO) algorithm as a practical im-
plementation to find the optimal policy. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the
proposed algorithm has better sample efficiency when achieving a comparable or
better performance on benchmark continuous control tasks. Codes are available

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.006600660066006601,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique for solving the sequential decision making
problems (Li, 2018; Sutton & Barto, 1998). Recent work on model-based RL (Nagabandi et al.,
2018; Luo et al., 2018; Kurutach et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019; Pan et al.,
2020), has shown the power of first learning the environment model and then using it to do the policy
optimization. Several methods are proposed to achieve the goal of getting similar performance by
using fewer data, such as ensembles (Kurutach et al., 2018), probabilistic models (Chua et al., 2018),
and meta-learning (Clavera et al., 2018)."

updating direction, these methods compute the policy gradient directly by back-propagating through
the model. Therefore, the model gradient is used in the calculation and its error will influence the
accuracy of the policy gradient. However, since the traditional model learning only aims to get the

learn to decrease the prediction error which results in an objective mismatch."
INTRODUCTION,0.01485148514851485,"In this paper, to address these problems, we first theoretically analyze the problem and then propose
our solution based on the theoretical results. First of all, we present the convergence rate analysis
for the policy optimization algorithms in which the policy gradient is calculated using the learned
environment model. By taking the model gradient error into account, we can see that the gradients
of the transition and reward models matter in the policy optimization. Specifically, the bias of the
estimated policy gradient used to update the policy is not only introduced by the prediction error of
the learned model but also introduced by the gradient error of the learned model. Furthermore, the
policy gradient bias due to the different types of model error will finally influence the convergence
rate of the policy optimization process."
INTRODUCTION,0.0165016501650165,"Then, inspired by the theoretical results, we propose the two-model-based learning method. Ac-
cording to the policy gradient bias and convergence rate analysis, in order to optimize the policy
efficiently and accurately, we need the learned environment model both with small prediction error
and small gradient error. Therefore, we propose to set separate models for different purposes of
usage. In the model learning phase, the prediction model aims to reduce the prediction error, and the
gradient model focuses on minimizing gradient error. In the policy optimization phase, we will use
the prediction model to rollout the data and use the gradient model to calculate the policy gradient."
INTRODUCTION,0.018151815181518153,"To make the proposed method applicable, we introduce the directional derivative projection policy
optimization (DDPPO) algorithm. Our first goal is to use data to estimate the gradient or Jacobian
matrix for the environment model and use the estimator to learn the model’s gradient explicitly.
The challenge is that the state and action are usually with high dimensions and directly estimating
the gradient or Jacobian matrix using data is intractable. Thus, we first estimate the directional
derivative using data and then project the model’s gradient or Jacobian matrix into these directions.
Minimizing the error between the estimated directional derivative and the projection value, we can
learn the model’s gradient. Secondly, after learning the environment model with a more accurate
gradient, we can leverage two-model-based learning method to do the policy optimization."

of the state’s dimension and the action’s dimension, which is usually large. Directly estimate the
gradient or Jacobian matrix is intractable. For model-based RL, we cannot estimate gradients by
perturbing one dimension of a state or action and estimate the partial derivative, because we can
only sample data from the environment, and this is contrary to the purpose of efficiency. Besides
these, we will also discuss how to design two models to rollout and calculate gradients respectively
when optimizing the policy. The overall algorithm pseudo-code is shown in Algorithm 1. More
details for explaining the pseudo-code can be found in Appendix B.1."

M g aims to better characterize the gradient

maximum likelihood objective by a gradient loss term that constraints the Jacobian of the learned

of the high dimensions, the directional derivative can be estimated by finite difference using data
sampled. Meanwhile, the directional derivative of the learned model can be calculated by projecting
the model’s gradient or Jacobian matrix into a certain direction."

difference as a target to constraint the Jacobian of the gradient model. Since the finite difference
converges to the directional derivative when the norm of v goes to zero, the data point x + v should
be close to x. So in this paper, we sample the nearest n data points of x to calculate n directional
derivatives in n different directions and use the finite difference to constraint the Jacobian of the
learned model. Sampling the nearest points is for a more accurate estimation of the directional
derivatives since the finite difference is closer to the true directional derivative if the two inputs are
closer. Then, the gradient loss item can be constructed as follows: R = 1 n n

COMPARISON WITH STATE-OF-THE-ARTS,0.25742574257425743,"To answer the first question, we compare our method against state-of-the-art model-based and
model-free methods in terms of sample complexity and asymptotic performance. Model-free base-
line includes SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018), which is a widely accepted baseline. For model-based
methods, we select MBPO (Janner et al., 2019) and STEVE (Buckman et al., 2019) as our base-
line which both use short-horizon model-based rollouts. We also compare to model-based methods
SVG (Heess et al., 2015), which firstly uses the derivative of models to learn the policy, and MAAC,
(Clavera et al., 2019) similar to SVG, however entirely relies on the predictions of the model, remov-
ing the need for likelihood ratio terms. MAGE (D’ Oro & Ja´skowski, 2020) is added to comparison
since this method focuses on the gradient of the Q-function."
COMPARISON WITH STATE-OF-THE-ARTS,0.2590759075907591,"The learning curves for all methods, shown in Figure 1, highlight the strength of our method in terms
of performance and sample complexity. In all the MuJoCo simulator environments, especially in two
higher-dimensional tasks, Ant and Humanoid, our method learns faster and has better efficiency than
previous model-based and model-free methods. Note that MAGE learns fastest on Humanoid, and
the trick of this algorithm can also be applied to our method. However, even without the help of
tricks in MAGE, we can still achieve better asymptotic properties. We get a return around 5400 in
the Humanoid environment using just over 100 thousand interactions with the environment, while
around three times as many interactions are needed for MBPO to achieve the same performance."

of the model by using the gradient loss? Firstly, we aim to analyze the difference between the
gradient of the true model and the learned model. We collect experience using a random policy and
train the model with and without gradient loss respectively. Then we calculate the MSE error of the
gradient of the model. Figure 2 shows how the gradient error and the prediction error changes during
training of the model on two simple environments that the true gradient is analytical available. From
the results in Figure 2 we can see that the prediction error for both models decreases to zero while the
gradient error of the model without gradient loss keeps larger than that of the model with gradient
loss. The learning curves highlight the strength of adding a gradient loss to the model in terms of
high prediction accuracy and accurate gradient estimation under the simple case."

the impact of training two models for prediction and gradient calculation respectively, we design a
variant of our method that trains only one model with gradient loss used for both purposes (single
model). The experimental results are shown in the right column of Figure 3. The results underpin the
importance of considering the gradient error when training the model if back-propagating through
it. On the other hand, the results highlight the strength of the two-model-based structure. We also
draw the prediction error of both models in our algorithm and the results are shown in Appendix
B.3. The prediction error of the prediction model is lower than that of the gradient model, which
further validates the idea of two-model-based learning. To address the concern that the improvement
of the performance may be caused by more parameters, we design a variant of our model that trains
a model with double parameters, however without gradient loss. The experimental results are shown
in Figure 4 that yields the importance of considering gradient information."

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,0.32673267326732675,"In this paper, we theoretically analyze how the model gradient error and the model prediction error
influence the policy gradient bias and the convergence rate of model-based policy optimization. The
theoretical results motivate us to design a two-model-based learning method for policy optimization.
We design the learning and using methods for the two models respectively by taking the model gra-
dient information into account and propose DDPPO algorithms as a practical implementation. Our
algorithm can achieve superior sample efficiency than state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement
learning algorithms on challenging high-dimensional continuous control tasks. For future work, it is
enticing to design a better gradient estimator in order to optimize the gradient model more efficiently.
The idea about learning the model according to its usage instead of only considering its prediction
error is also general enough to be applied to other problems beyond reinforcement learning."

RELATED WORK"
REFERENCES,0.429042904290429,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique for solving the sequential decision making
problems (Li, 2018; Sutton & Barto, 1998). The sequential decision-making problem is always
formulated as the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. The agent uses policy to determine
its action according to the current state of the environment, interacts with the environment, and gets
the immediate reward from the environment as feedback. Then, the environment changes to the next
state. The goal for reinforcement learning is to find the optimal policy that can achieve the highest
expectation of the summation of the future reward. Recent work on model-based RL (Nagabandi
et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2018; Kurutach et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019; Pan et al.,
2020), has shown the power of first learning the environment model and then use it to do the policy
optimization. These methods all achieve similar performance by using fewer data compared to their
model-free counterparts."
REFERENCES,0.4306930693069307,"Model-free and Model-based Methods: Model-free approaches, as a general-purpose tool for
learning complex policies (Mnih et al., 2015; Lillicrap et al., 2016; Haarnoja et al., 2018), has the
problem of low-efficiency (Janner et al., 2019), which limits the application in real-world physical
systems where data collection can be an arduous process. Model-based Reinforcement Learning
attempts to reduce sample complexity while maintaining the asymptotic performance. The learned
model can be viewed as a black-box simulator and then used for training a model-free policy (Naga-
bandi et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2018; Kurutach et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019; Pan
et al., 2020). Tools like ensembles (Kurutach et al., 2018), probabilistic models (Chua et al., 2018),
and meta-learning (Clavera et al., 2018) are widely used in model-based RL. A major problem of
model-based RL is model-bias (Deisenroth & Rasmussen, 2011) caused by a compounding error
effect of long-term predictions. To address this problem, a popular approach is to use interpolation
between different horizon predictions (Buckman et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019) and interpolating
between model and real data (Kalweit & Boedecker, 2017). Different from the traditional model
based method, we argue to learn the model beyond the accurate prediction and to use the model
more efficiently by calculating the policy gradient analytically through the learned model."
REFERENCES,0.43234323432343236,"Improved Model-based Methods: Several issues have been studied to achieve better performance
in model-based RL. Malik et al. (2019) explore which uncertainties are needed for model-based RL.
Further research implements a masking mechanism based on the model’s uncertainty estimation to
decide whether the model should be used or not (Pan et al., 2020). Dropout mechanisms are also
applied to model-based RL algorithms to improve the robustness while maintaining high sampling
efficiency (Zhang et al., 2021b). Efficient exploration is also considered in model-based RL (Curi
et al., 2020; Song & Sun, 2021; Yao et al., 2021). For model learning, Ke et al. (2018) use latent
variables to carry future information that improves long-term predictions, Tomar et al. (2021) use
model-invariance state abstraction to improve generalization. K´egl et al. (2021) firstly design met-
rics to evaluate the various popular generative models when using them on the control problem.
Zhang et al. (2021a) shows that tuning of hyperparameters dynamically improves the performance
compared to using static hyperparameters which are kept fix for the whole training. This operation
can be seen as a simple treatment of model uncertainty. Considering that we also need the predic-
tion model at the model learning and using phase, we can leverage the useful ideas inside of these
methods to help us to build a robust prediction model and use it efficiently."

policy optimization or Q learning. D’Oro et al. (2020) using policy gradient to re-weight the model

entirely relies on the predictions of the model, removing the need for likelihood ratio terms, and
achieves better performance than MBPO leveraging model-based value expansion for updating pol-
icy and Q-function. The plan horizon in these methods allows to trade-off between the accuracy
of the learned model and the accuracy of the learned Q-function. In addition to back-propagating
through the path, MAGE (D’ Oro & Ja´skowski, 2020) uses the differentiability of the learned model
to compute gradient targets in temporal difference learning. Our method is different from these
methods. Different from these methods, our main contribution is that we propose to use two models
to learn the model prediction and the model gradient respectively. By explicitly construct the gradi-
ent estimator, our gradient model can produce a more accurate policy gradient and thus benefits for
the policy optimization."

Note that reparameterization and important sampling weights are needed for this method. In our
paper, we use the learned model as a deterministic model that only uses the mean outputted as the
prediction. Now we show an example of calculating the gradient. When predicting, we first receive
a state s and use the policy to get action a, then using the prediction model to get the next state
and reward s′, r. Note that we need to memory the computation graph for getting the action. Then
we use the gradient model to calculate the gradient by feeding the (s, a) to it and back-propagation.

the function and the input value. Therefore, as in the Equation 3, both the function( ˜f and ˜r) to be
taking gradient and the input value ˜st are different from the ground-truth. So we need to first bound
the error of the prediction state(Lemma 1) and then bound the error of the gradient of the learned

PROOF OF THE THEOREM 2"

function brought by parameter updating into two terms according to its smooth assumption(Equation
35). The first term is an inner product term. The inter product term can be further decompose into
two terms(Equation 36). One is about the model error and the other one is about the non-i.i.d.
data. We can carefully bound each terms and then combine them all together to proof the theorem.
