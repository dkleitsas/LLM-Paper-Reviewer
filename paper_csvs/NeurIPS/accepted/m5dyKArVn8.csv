ABSTRACT,0.001692047377326565,"As performance gains through scaling data and/or model size experience diminish-
ing returns, it is becoming increasingly popular to turn to ensembling, where the
predictions of multiple models are combined to improve accuracy. In this paper, we
provide a detailed analysis of how the disagreement and the polarization (a notion
we introduce and define in this paper) among classifiers relate to the performance
gain achieved by aggregating individual classifiers, for majority vote strategies
in classification tasks. We address these questions in the following ways. (1) An
upper bound for polarization is derived, and we propose what we call a neural
polarization law: most interpolating neural network models are 4/3-polarized. Our
empirical results not only support this conjecture but also show that polarization
is nearly constant for a dataset, regardless of hyperparameters or architectures of
classifiers. (2) The error rate of the majority vote classifier is considered under
restricted entropy conditions, and we present a tight upper bound that indicates
that the disagreement is linearly correlated with the error rate, and that the slope
is linear in the polarization. (3) We prove results for the asymptotic behavior of
the disagreement in terms of the number of classifiers, which we show can help in
predicting the performance for a larger number of classifiers from that of a smaller
number. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical results on several
image classification tasks with various types of neural networks."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.005076142131979695,"As performance gains through scaling data and/or model size experience diminishing returns, it
is becoming increasingly popular to turn to ensembling, where the predictions of multiple models
are combined, both to improve accuracy and to form more robust conclusions than any individual
model alone can provide. In some cases, ensembling can produce substantial benefits, particularly
when increasing model size becomes prohibitive. In particular, for large neural network models,
deep ensembles [LPB17] are especially popular. These ensembles consist of independently trained
models on the same dataset, often using the same hyperparameters, but starting from different
initializations."
INTRODUCTION,0.00676818950930626,"The cost of producing new classifiers can be steep, and it is often unclear whether the additional
performance gains are worth the cost. Assuming that constructing two or three classifiers is relatively
cheap, procedures capable of deciding whether to continue producing more classifiers are needed.
To do so requires a precise understanding of how to predict ensemble performance. Of particular
interest are majority vote strategies in classification tasks, noting that regression tasks can also be
formulated in this way by clustering outputs. In this case, one of the most effective avenues for"
INTRODUCTION,0.008460236886632826,"predicting performance is the disagreement [JNBK22, BJRK22]: measuring the degree to which
classifiers provide different conclusions over a given dataset. Disagreement is concrete, easy to
compute, and strongly linearly correlated with majority vote prediction accuracy, leading to its use
in many applications. However, a priori, the precise linear relationship between disagreement and
accuracy is unclear, preventing the use of disagreement for predicting ensemble performance."
INTRODUCTION,0.01015228426395939,"Our goal in this paper is to go beyond disagreement-based analysis to provide a more quantitative
understanding of the number of classifiers one should use to achieve a desired level of performance
in modern practical applications, in particular for neural network models. In more detail, our
contributions are as follows."
INTRODUCTION,0.011844331641285956,"(i) We introduce and define the concept of polarization, a notion that measures the higher-
order dispersity of the error rates at each data point, and which indicates how polarized the
ensemble is relative to the ground truth. We state and prove an upper bound for polarization
(Theorem 1). Inspired by the theorem, we propose what we call a neural polarization law
(Conjecture 1): most interpolating (Definition 2) neural network models are 4/3-polarized. We
provide empirical results supporting the conjecture (Figures 1 and 2)."
INTRODUCTION,0.01353637901861252,"(ii) Using the notion of polarization, we develop a refined set of bounds on the majority vote
test error rate. For one, we provide a sharpened bound for any ensembles with a finite
number of classifiers (Corollary 1). For the other, we offer a new, tighter bound under an
additional condition on the entropy of the ensemble (Theorem 4). We provide empirical results
that demonstrate our new bounds perform significantly better than the existing bounds on the
majority vote test error (Figure 3)."
INTRODUCTION,0.015228426395939087,"(iii) The asymptotic behavior of the majority vote error rate is determined as the number of
classifiers increases (Theorem 5). Consequently, we show that we can predict the performance
for a larger number of classifiers from that of a smaller number. We provide empirical results
that show such predictions are accurate across various pairs of model architecture and dataset
(Figure 4)."
INTRODUCTION,0.01692047377326565,"In Section 2, we define the notations that will be used throughout the paper, and we introduce upper
bounds for the error rate of the majority vote from previous work. The next three sections are the main
part of the paper. In Section 3, we introduce the notion of polarization, ηρ, which plays a fundamental
role in relating the majority vote error rate to average error rate and disagreement. We explore the
properties of the polarization and present empirical results that corroborate our claims. In Section
4, we present tight upper bounds for the error rate of the majority vote for ensembles that satisfy
certain conditions; and in Section 5, we prove how disagreement behaves in terms of the number of
classifiers. All of these ingredients are put together to estimate the error rate of the majority vote for
a large number of classifiers using information from only three sampled classifiers. In Section 6, we
provide a brief discussion and conclusion. Additional material is presented in the appendices."

Bounds on the majority vote error rate
The simplest relationship between the majority vote error L(hMV

was introduced in [McA98]. It states that the error in the majority vote classifier cannot exceed twice
the average error rate:"

(2) does not provide useful information in practice, it is worth noting that this bound is, in fact, tight.
There exist pathological examples where hMV

those where it is more likely—in average across the data—that more classifiers are correct than not.

Discussion and Conclusion"
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION,0.3062605752961083,"This work addresses the question: how does the majority vote error rate change according to the
number of classifiers? While this is an age-old question, it is one that has received renewed interest in
recent years. On the journey to answering the question, we introduce several new ideas of independent
interest. (1) We introduced the polarization ηρ, of an ensemble of classifiers. This notion plays an
important role throughout this paper and appears in every upper bound presented. Although Theorem 1
gives some insight into polarization, our conjectured neural polarization law (Conjecture 1) is yet to
be proved or disproved, and it provides an exciting avenue for future work. (2) We proposed two
classes of ensembles whose entropy is restricted in different ways. Without these constraints, there
will always be examples that saturate even the least useful majority vote error bounds. We believe that
accurately describing how models behave in terms of the entropy of their output is key to precisely
characterizing the behavior of majority vote, and likely other ensembling methods."
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION,0.3079526226734349,"Throughout this paper, we have theoretically and empirically demonstrated that polarization is
fairly invariant to the hyperparameters and architecture of classifiers. We also proved a tight bound
for majority vote error, under an assumption with another quantity ε, and we presented how the
components of this tight bound behave according to the number of classifiers. Altogether, we have
sharpened bounds on the majority vote error to the extent that we are able to identify the trend of
majority vote error rate in terms of number of classifiers."
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION,0.3096446700507614,"We close with one final remark regarding the metrics used to evaluate an ensemble. Majority vote
error rate is the most common and popular metric used to measure the performance of an ensemble.
However, it seems unlikely that a practitioner would consider an ensemble to have performed
adequately if the majority vote conclusion was correct, but was only reached by a relatively small
fraction of the classifiers. With the advent of large language models, it is worth considering whether
the majority vote error rate is still as valuable. The natural alternative in this regard is the probability
Pρ(Wρ > 1/2), that is, the probability that at least half of the classifiers agree on the correct answer.
This quantity is especially well-behaved, and it frequently appears in our proofs. (Indeed, every
bound presented in this work serves as an upper bound for Pρ(Wρ > 1/2).) We conjecture that this
quantity is useful much more generally."

Invariance principle of U-statistics
In this subsection, we state the invariance principle of U-statistics, which plays a main role in the
proof of Theorem 5. We note that this is a special case of an approximation of random walks

to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster."
