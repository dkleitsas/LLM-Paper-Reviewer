ABSTRACT,0.002881844380403458,"Recently, multi-modal entity alignment has emerged as a pivotal endeavor for
the integration of Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) originating from
diverse data sources. Existing works primarily focus on fully depicting entity
features by designing various modality encoders or fusion approaches. However,
uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues, such as weak
inter-modal associations, description diversity, and modality absence, still severely
hinder the effective exploration of aligned entity similarities. To this end, in
this paper, we propose a novel Tackling uncertain correspondences method for
Multi-modal Entity Alignment (TMEA). Specifically, to handle diverse attribute
knowledge descriptions, we design alignment-augmented abstract representation
that incorporates the large language model and in-context learning into attribute
alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract. In
order to mitigate the influence of the modality absence, we propose to unify all
modality features into a shared latent subspace and generate pseudo features via
variational autoencoders according to existing modal features. Then, we develop an
inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with
orthogonal constraints, to address weak semantic associations between modalities.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of
TMEA with a clear improvement over competitive baselines."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.008645533141210375,"Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) effectively store a substantial volume of knowledge
encompassing diverse modalities including visual, relational, and attribute information in a structured
and organized manner [23, 43, 44]. They greatly facilitate the advancement of various downstream
tasks such as recommender systems [41, 47, 12, 34], video understanding [40, 51, 39], and domain-
specific applications [7, 30, 35, 49]. In order to construct a more comprehensive multi-modal
knowledge base for supporting external knowledge comprehension and reasoning, the demand for
integrating MMKGs from heterogeneous data sources has become extremely urgent. As a result,
multi-modal entity alignment to match entities referring to identical real-world concepts from distinct
MMKGs has emerged as an increasingly critical task for their integration [23, 5, 6]."

and struggle to accommodate
diverse multi-modal knowl-
edge, which makes it difficult
to fulfill the need for align-
ing entities across MMKGs.
Therefore, recent studies [5,
21, 19] have introduced di-
verse modality encoders or
fusion approaches tailored to
the characteristics of multi-
modal knowledge, striving to
fully extract information from
all modalities so as to effec-
tively portray the features of
entities.
For modality en-

ops vision-guided encoders
for relational and attribute
knowledge to achieve inter-
modal enhancement.
ACK-
MMEA [19] unifies the en-
coding of multi-modal fea-
tures by designing a specialized graph neural network to ensure consistent modal aggregation.
Regarding fusion approaches, MMEA [5] synthesizes multiple representations by transferring each
uni-modal embedding into a common space. EVA [22] incorporates multi-modal features into a
combined embedding using an attention-driven modality weighting mechanism."
INTRODUCTION,0.06051873198847262,"Although these methods have made remarkable progress in extracting and fusing multi-modal features
for entity representation, there still remain many substantial challenges, particularly the limitation
of uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues of entities [33, 16]. Figure 1
illustrates a toy example of such uncertain correspondences. Firstly, the weak semantic associations
among diverse modal knowledge of entities pose a considerable challenge in inter-modal enhancement.
In MMKG1, “Twilight” has attributes “Release Date” and “Runtime Duration” along with an image
of a movie poster containing two roles. The poster does not include content that could semantically
overlap with these attributes, which makes it hard to capture their feature commonality to perform
inter-modal enhancement. Secondly, the distinct descriptive manners of entities across different
MMKGs complicate the matching of attributes with the same meanings between aligned entities.
For instance, “Release Date” for “Twilight” in MMKG1 and “Debut Date” for “Twilight (film)” in
MMKG2 both mean the initial release date of the movie. This requires a more profound semantic
understanding to ascertain if they convey the same meanings. Thirdly, MMKGs often lack complete
entity knowledge, with certain modalities entirely devoid of data. This impedes the differentiation
of whether two entities are aligned, as this distinction can be readily misled by consistent modality
features of unaligned entities. Due to missing attributes for “Kristen Stewart” in MMKG1 and
images for “KStew” in MMKG2, there is a high chance of erroneous matching “Bella Swan” in
MMKG2 based on its visual similarity to “Kristen Stewart”. Given the challenges presented above,
the exploration of tackling uncertain correspondences is crucial in multi-modal entity alignment task."
INTRODUCTION,0.06340057636887608,"To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Tackling uncertain correspondences

multi-modal entity alignment."
RELATED WORK,0.08357348703170028,"Traditional Entity Alignment. Traditional knowledge graphs are composed of textual symbol triples,
which often result in information overload [4]. Therefore, entity alignment was proposed to match
the identical entities in various KGs for their integration [9]. Existing methods mainly rely on entity
embedding techniques, which can be grouped into triple-based embedding [53, 31] and neighbor-
based embedding [36, 42]. Triple-based embedding defines an energy function to measure the
plausibility of triples. For example, MTransE [9] adopted TransE [2] as the entity encoder to embed
different KGs into independent vector spaces and then learned the transitions between aligned entities.
IPTransE [53] implemented an iterative strategy and employed it to supplement probably aligned
entities into the training set. Neighbor-based embedding exploits the subgraph structure organized by
partial relations between entities. For instance, GCN-Align [36] used graph convolutional networks
to aggregate the neighborhood information of entities. MixTEA [42] instructed the graph model
learning by an end-to-end mixture teaching of manually labeled mappings and probabilistic pseudo
mappings. PEEA [32] increased the connections between far-away entities and labeled ones by
incorporating positional information into the representation learning with a position attention layer.
However, they cannot accommodate diverse multi-modal knowledge and satisfy the requirement for
multi-modal entity alignment."
RELATED WORK,0.08645533141210375,"Multi-Modal Entity Alignment. Due to the urgent demand for the integration of MMKGs, extensive
research has been dedicated to multi-modal entity alignment [23, 6, 21, 19]. Initially, multi-modal
entity alignment was regarded as a special type of link prediction task, aiming to connect entities
through the “SameAs” relation [23]. Subsequently, the first attempt in multi-modal entity alignment
introduced the pioneering MMEA [5] approach, which transferred multi-modal representations into
a unified space by minimizing the distance between the fused embeddings and each uni-modal
embedding. Later, Liu et al. [22] believed that visual modality has abundant features as the advantage,
thus leveraging visual similarities to augment the training data by iteratively adding aligned pairs.
The previous studies employed independent encoders for feature extraction of each modality, without
considering interactions between different modalities. Therefore, MSNEA [6] proposed a modality
interaction mechanism to guide relationship learning and attribute selection using visual features, and
designed multi-modal contrastive learning to make features of aligned entities more similar. Owing
to the impact of contextual gaps on effectiveness, ACK-MMEA [19] utilized merge and generate
operators to build an attribute-consistent MMKG, and aggregated the consistent information through
graph neural networks. Despite their remarkable advancement, there still remain some significant
challenges like uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues of entities."

MULTI-MODAL KNOWLEDGE ENCODER,0.23919308357348704,"Attribute Knowledge Encoder. An attribute triple can be denoted as (e, a, v) ∈TA. Aligning
attributes across different MMKGs is challenging due to the variations in the expression of identical
attributes. It necessitates more than a basic lexical comparison and requires a profound semantic
understanding to ascertain whether attributes with different labels indeed represent the same concept.
Recently, the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs have been proven across multiple
tasks [1, 8, 10]. The pre-existing knowledge within LLMs can help bridge gaps in information that
may not be explicitly stated. Moreover, in-context learning [37, 52] is a prompt engineering method
where task demonstrations are included in the prompt. With in-context learning, off-the-shelf LLM
can solve attribute alignment without fine-tuning. Therefore, we design an alignment-augmented
abstract representation that incorporates the GPT 3.5 [25] and in-context learning [13] into attribute
alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract. For attribute alignment,
the prompt is devised as shown in Appendix A. As the attributes that cannot be aligned often become
noise [45], we only retain those attributes that can be aligned according to the results of GPT 3.5.
Next, we convert the filtered attribute triples into a textual abstract sentence. For an entity e and its n
filtered attribute triples (e, a1, v1), (e, a2, v2), ..., (e, an, vn), the template of abstract sentence S is
“a1 is v1, a2 is v2, ..., an is vn”. Given two attribute triples (“Twilight”, “Release Date”, “2008.916”)
and (“Twilight”, “Runtime Duration”, “117”) related to “Twilight”, we construct a abstract sentence
of “Release Date is 2008.916, Runtime Duration is 117”. Then, we use a pre-trained BERT [11]
model to generate the representation of this sentence, thus forming the attribute embedding of the
entity in the following:"

structure and distribution. We utilize VAEs to unify features of one target modality and concatenated
features of other modalities into a shared latent subspace. In this latent subspace, data from various

from other modalities to approximate that of the target modality, thereby generating pseudo-features."
MISSING MODALITY IMPUTATION,0.26512968299711814,"Typically, entities in MMKGs cannot lack relational knowledge, because entities without relations are

different modalities may negatively impact overall performance, potentially resulting in performance
worse than that of a single modality."

PERFORMANCE COMPARISON,0.40634005763688763,"We compared TMEA with several representative and state-of-the-art baselines for multi-modal entity
alignment task on FB15K-DB15K and FB15K-YG15K datasets. Table 1 shows the performance of
all methods with 20% aligned entity pairs for training. Overall, our proposed TMEA achieves the best
performance on both datasets. Specifically, we have the following findings. First, TMEA exhibits
significant improvements with a notable margin compared to not only traditional but also multi-
modal methods. Compared to the strongest traditional alignment method, BootEA, TMEA achieves
at least a 168.4%, 63.0%, and 118.3% improvement in H@1, H@10, and MRR on two datasets,
respectively. When assessed against the leading multi-modal method, MSNEA, TMEA attained
at least a 32.8%, 16.3%, and 26.4% increase in H@1, H@10, and MRR, respectively. Besides,
we test the statistical significance and the results suggest TMEA has significant improvements
(p-value < 0.001) over baselines. Second, comparing multi-modal entity alignment methods to
traditional ones, we observe a clear advantage in favor of multi-modal approaches in most cases.
TMEA, MSNEA, and MCLEA surpass all traditional approaches, which suggests the effect of
leveraging the rich and varied information that multi-modal knowledge provides. This additional
context and modeling allow for a more comprehensive depiction of entity features, facilitating a
more accurate determination of potential alignments. Third, our TMEA method, leveraging only 20%
of aligned entity pairs for training, achieves a remarkable H@10 score of 0.944 and 0.916 on two
datasets. This large margin of superiority over other multi-modal entity alignment methods can be
attributed to the considering and effective tackling of uncertain correspondences in the alignment
process. By addressing these inherent issues, TMEA is demonstrated to enhance the precision and
reliability of entity alignment for MMKGs."

an MRR exceeding 0.5, while MSNEA falls below 0.4. For missing attribute modality, both TMEA

the reduction of training data proportions, unlike the majority of methods that experience a marked

than MCLEA with 50% of training data, yet surpass MCLEA when the training data is increased to

Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a novel TMEA to tackle uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or
intra-modal cues of entities for multi-modal entity alignment. Specifically, we first developed a Multi-
modal Knowledge Encoder (MKE) module to encode relational, attribute, and visual knowledge into
their preliminary feature representations. In MKE, to address the diversity of descriptive manners
of attribute knowledge, we particularly designed alignment-augmented abstract representation that
incorporated the LLM and in-context learning into attribute alignment and filtering for generating
and embedding the attribute abstract. To mitigate the influence of the modality absence, we devised a
Missing Modality Imputation (MMI) module to complete the missing modality by unifying diverse
modalities into a shared latent subspace and generating a pseudo feature via VAEs based on existing
modal features. For enhancing the semantic associations between modalities, we invented an inter-
modal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints in
Multi-modal Commonality Enhancement (MCE) module. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-
world datasets were conducted to verify the effectiveness of TMEA with a significant improvement
over competitive baselines."

Parameter Sensitivity"
RANKI,0.8242074927953891,"We have introduced coefficients λ1 and λ2 for the two constraint losses in the overall objective
function to balance the impact of different losses. Here, we investigate the performance change of
TMEA with varying coefficients. We conducted experiments by choosing values for λ1 and λ2 from
the list [1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1, 1], and the results on FB15K-DB15K are illustrated in Figure 5.
The results indicate that the optimal values for λ1 and λ2 are 1e-2. When values are greater than 1e-2,
the performance shows a declining trend. This is because excessive emphasis on constraint behavior
can lead to a deviation in the optimization direction. 0.880 0.885 0.890 0.895 0.900 0.905"

Broader Impact"
RANKI,0.8501440922190202,"The impact of TMEA extends beyond its immediate application in integrating knowledge graphs from
diverse data sources. By addressing the challenges of tackling uncertain correspondences, TMEA
offers a framework that can be generalized to various multimodal learning tasks like multimodal
recommendation systems, multimodal document classification, and multimodal sentiment analysis."
RANKI,0.8530259365994236,"For instance, in the domain of multi-modal recommendation systems, where diverse sources of
information need to be fused to provide personalized recommendations, TMEA can be adapted to
enhance the alignment between different modalities (e.g., user preferences, item descriptions, and
user-item interactions). By leveraging its alignment-augmented abstract representation and inter-
modal commonality enhancement mechanism, TMEA can effectively capture the subtle semantic
associations between modalities, leading to more accurate and personalized recommendations."
RANKI,0.8559077809798271,"Furthermore, TMEA’s approach to handling diverse attribute knowledge descriptions and modality
absence can also benefit other multi-modal learning tasks, such as image-text matching, cross-
modal retrieval, and multimodal sentiment analysis. In these tasks, where aligning and integrating
information from multiple modalities is crucial, TMEA’s methodology of unifying modality features
and enhancing commonalities can contribute to improved performance and robustness."
RANKI,0.8587896253602305,"By fostering an environment where multi-modal data is more accurately aligned and integrated, the
TMEA model paves the way for novel applications and research opportunities. For instance, in
healthcare, it could support more robust diagnostic tools and patient care strategies by providing a
comprehensive view of patient data across modalities. In financial markets, it might offer deeper
insights through the integration of textual reports, market data, and socio-economic indicators,
leading to more informed investment strategies. Beyond these, the model’s application could extend
to areas like intelligent urban planning, environmental monitoring, and personalized education, each
benefiting from the nuanced understanding and integration of diverse data streams."
RANKI,0.861671469740634,"In summary, TMEA’s broader impact lies in its potential to advance the field of multi-modal learning
by providing a versatile framework that can be applied to a wide range of tasks or scenarios requiring
multi-modal fusion and alignment."
RANKI,0.8645533141210374,"E
Limitations"
RANKI,0.8674351585014409,"Although the TMEA method offers apparent advantages, its practical application is limited by several
factors. Firstly, the attribute knowledge encoder relies on the large language model trained on general
corpora, rather than KG-specific data. Consequently, the model’s semantic understanding may lack
the depth and specificity necessary for KG contexts. In the future, we will explore fine-tuning
open-source large language models to enhance semantic understanding specifically tailored to KG
attributes. Secondly, TMEA depends on aligned entity annotation data for feature extraction and
model optimization. This dependency presents challenges, particularly in scenarios where annotations
are scarce or costly to obtain. To address this issue, our future investigations will focus on fully
leveraging multi-modal data in unsupervised settings, aiming to mitigate the reliance on annotated
data while enhancing model performance."

LIMITATIONS,0.899135446685879,Justification: We discuss the limitations in the Appendix E.
LIMITATIONS,0.9020172910662824,Guidelines:
LIMITATIONS,0.9048991354466859,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations."

• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented

perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Appendix C.3 and Appendix C.4.
Guidelines:"
THEORY ASSUMPTIONS AND PROOFS,0.9250720461095101,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:

the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean."
THEORY ASSUMPTIONS AND PROOFS,0.9481268011527377,"• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Appendix D.
Guidelines:"
THEORY ASSUMPTIONS AND PROOFS,0.9654178674351584,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to"
THEORY ASSUMPTIONS AND PROOFS,0.968299711815562,"generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:"
THEORY ASSUMPTIONS AND PROOFS,0.9740634005763689,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
