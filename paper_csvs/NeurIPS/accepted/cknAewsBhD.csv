ABSTRACT,0.0029154518950437317,"Event cameras provide exceptionally high temporal resolution in dynamic vision
systems due to their unique event-driven mechanism. However, the sparse and
asynchronous nature of event data makes frame-based visual processing methods
inappropriate. This study proposes a novel framework, Event-based Graph Spa-
tiotemporal Sensitive Transformer (EGSST), for the exploitation of spatial and
temporal properties of event data. Firstly, a well-designed graph structure is em-
ployed to model event data, which not only preserves the original temporal data but
also captures spatial details. Furthermore, inspired by the phenomenon that human
eyes pay more attention to objects that produce significant dynamic changes, we
design a Spatiotemporal Sensitivity Module (SSM) and an adaptive Temporal Acti-
vation Controller (TAC). Through these two modules, our framework can mimic
the response of the human eyes in dynamic environments by selectively activating
the temporal attention mechanism based on the relative dynamics of event data,
thereby effectively conserving computational resources. In addition, the integration
of a lightweight, multi-scale Linear Vision Transformer (LViT) markedly enhances
processing efficiency. Our research proposes a fully event-driven approach, effec-
tively exploiting the temporal precision of event data and optimising the allocation
of computational resources by intelligently distinguishing the dynamics within
the event data. The framework provides a lightweight, fast, accurate, and fully
event-based solution for object detection tasks in complex dynamic environments,
demonstrating significant practicality and potential for application. The source
code can be found at: EGSST."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.008746355685131196,"There is an increasing demand for devices capable of accurately capturing targets in high-speed
dynamic scenes, such as autonomous driving, where traditional CMOS or CCD visual sensors often
encounter motion blur and overexposure [1, 2, 3]. In response, event cameras, which employ a novel
event-driven mechanism, have garnered significant attention. Each pixel in event cameras operates
independently, activating only upon detecting a brightness change. This mechanism results in a
series of high-speed, asynchronous event streams with exceptionally high temporal resolution, which
enables the rapid and precise capture of data [4, 5]."
INTRODUCTION,0.011661807580174927,"Our objective in processing the output data from event cameras is to effectively utilize their high
temporal precision in detection tasks without inducing significant delays. However, the data format
of event cameras is entirely different from that of frame-based cameras, rendering existing object
detection methods based on RGB images inapplicable [6]. Some methods adopt conversion strategies,
utilizing techniques such as temporal slicing to transform sparse data into dense formats, with"

INTRODUCTION,0.10787172011661808,"Figure 1: An overview of the proposed EGSST framework. The EGSST is an event-based,
lightweight, and efficient framework designed for rapid object detection in event data. A graph is
constructed from the data and divided into K connected subgraphs. These subgraphs are fed into a
Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) [22] and a SSM. The GCN processes the subgraphs that are
not removed to produce a global Graph Feature Map, which preserves both spatial and temporal
information. The SSM assesses the dynamics of the entire graph and outputs a dynamic feature
indicator, which includes the dynamics of each subgraph and the aggregated dynamics obtained
through a Graph Attention Network (GAT) [23]. The TAC is activated based on the output from the
SSM to enhance focus on the temporal dimension or to feed the graph feature maps directly into a
Multi-scale Linear ViT [24]. Finally, a detection head, such as RT-DETR [25] or YOLOX [26], is
employed to generate prediction outputs."
INTRODUCTION,0.11078717201166181,"the aim of leveraging architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers
[2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Unfortunately, methods employing such conversion strategies often result in a loss
of temporal precision. Another direct processing strategies involve methods such as Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) [12, 13, 14, 15] or Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21],
which analyze the event stream directly, thereby preserving spatiotemporal structure and accuracy.
However, the direct processing strategies often suffer from computational efficiency. The latest
hybrid strategies strive to combine the strengths of previous methods, enhancing performance while
maximizing retention of temporal precision. Although numerous existing strategies have made
significant progress in the extraction of event data features, challenges remain in effectively managing
data across spatial and temporal dimensions [12, 14]."
INTRODUCTION,0.11370262390670553,"Existing methods may result in the inefficient use of computational resources when processing
data across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Because current models either apply a single
algorithm to both dimensions simultaneously [12, 20] or use different algorithms for each dimension
and then combine the results [27]. Importantly, processing in the temporal dimension typically
consumes significantly more computational resources than processing in the spatial dimension.
Consequently, the continuous processing of temporal data is likely to result in the inefficient utilization
of computational resources, especially for slower-moving objects where spatial resolution may already
be sufficient."
INTRODUCTION,0.11661807580174927,"In order to address the aforementioned issue of inefficiency, we have drawn inspiration from the
dynamic perception of human eyes. The human visual system naturally prioritizes rapidly moving
objects within the visual field while de-prioritizing slower ones—an adaptive feature that enhances
responsiveness and efficiency in dynamic environments. Ideally, artificial models can emulate this
trait by preferentially processing faster-moving objects in the temporal dimension, especially when
managing large volumes of continuous spatiotemporal data. Therefore, we try to develop a novel
algorithm that is closer to the selective attention mechanism of the human eye, which could potentially
enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of event-based vision systems."
INTRODUCTION,0.119533527696793,"We propose a novel spatiotemporal fusion graph transformer framework, designed to fully leverage

details. A key aspect of our framework is the SSM module, which leverages the graph’s ability to
process unstructured data and aggregates features to effectively discern the relative dynamics of
objects. This differentiation provides a critical basis for determining whether to continue processing
in the temporal dimension. Subsequently, the adaptive TAC is introduced, which dynamically adjusts
its activation based on the insights from the SSM. The TAC is designed to enhance the processing of
highly dynamic events while reducing resource use in scenarios with low dynamics. Furthermore,
the integration of a lightweight multi-scale LViT markedly enhances the processing efficiency of our
system. The principal contributions of our research are as follows:"

approaches generate continuous optical flow and intensity estimation images from event streams
[30], or incorporate attention mechanisms with recurrent and convolutional networks to enhance
spatio-temporal feature extraction [31]. These strategies extend the applicability of event camera data
but often at the cost of reducing its high temporal resolution [32, 33, 34]."
RELATED WORK,0.14285714285714285,"Direct Processing Strategy focuses on preserving the original asynchronous characteristics of event

strategies to retain asynchronous temporal features. While these methods effectively utilize the unique
properties of event data, they face challenges in handling large volumes of sparse data, highlighting
the need for further innovations in architecture [36, 20]."

GNNs with CNNs, and integrating Transformers with recurrent neural networks, effectively captures
spatio-temporal features from asynchronous events while maintaining high resolution and enhancing
adaptability [38, 39]. Methods like MatrixLSTM [40] and RED [9] increase data processing efficiency
by jointly extracting features. Building on these studies, a recent work, RVT [27], integrates
Transformers with recurrent neural networks, significantly improving processing efficiency and
accuracy. However, current models, despite their commendable performance and efficiency, cannot
effectively differentiate dynamic data, leading to unnecessary computations in the time dimension."

ratio-based method, f(x, y) = x/y. This choice is motivated by the desire to balance simplicity and
computational efficiency. The ratio directly reflects the relationship between the number of events and
the temporal spread in the subgraph, providing an intuitive measure of local motion dynamics. By
using this straightforward formulation, we ensure that the computation remains tractable, especially

aggregate information based on the importance of their features and their neighbors, strengthening the
connections between nodes representing the same object while weakening those representing different
objects. The GAT’s attention mechanism also ensures that smaller objects are not overlooked and
evaluates their significance in the overall environment. The aggregated values are used as the final
output of the SSM for assessing relative motion. Figure 2 shows some example results, illustrating

significant performance degradation compared to models equipped with such capabilities [43, 44, 45].
To address this issue, our enhanced ViT module supports multi-scale processing and incorporates
the TAC, which improves the model’s ability to handle spatial and temporal dimensions. To reduce
the computational load and increase processing speed, we adopt linear transformations to simplify
the self-attention mechanism. Drawing upon techniques from models like Efficient ViT [24], which

Dynamic Label Augmentation"
DYNAMIC LABEL AUGMENTATION,0.43731778425655976,"In our model, we use a batch segmentation method based on a fixed number of events, which
requires generating corresponding labels for inputs with varying numbers of nodes. However, the data
generation speed of event cameras is extremely high, while the number of labels available in existing
datasets is relatively limited. For instance, current datasets such as Gen1 cannot effectively provide
sufficient labels to match the rapidly collected fixed-number event data. To address this mismatch, it
is necessary to develop an effective approach to increase the number of available labels."
DYNAMIC LABEL AUGMENTATION,0.4402332361516035,"A common approach is to extend the labeling by adding a fixed time window before and after each
label, mapping all the data within that time frame to the same label [12, 27, 51, 52]. While this
method can indeed increase the number of labels under typical conditions, it can introduce significant
labeling errors when applied to fixed-number event-based batch segmentation, especially in dynamic
environments with substantial variability."
DYNAMIC LABEL AUGMENTATION,0.44314868804664725,"To address this issue, we propose a dynamic label augmentation method. This approach dynamically
adjusts the labeling precision based on the time span over which events are captured, aiming to
expanding the number of labels while enhancing labeling accuracy. Specifically, in the dynamic label
augmentation method, a longer time span for collecting a fixed number of events indicates slower
target motion, allowing for an expanded time window to capture more labels for the current target.
Conversely, a shorter time span suggests faster target motion, necessitating a smaller time window to
maintain accurate labeling. More details can be found in the Appendix C."

activates TAC, thereby causing the parameters involved in the forward computation to vary dynami-
cally as well. For quantitative analysis, we calculated the average amount of parameters under the
condition of 10,000 event inputs across our test dataset. As shown in Table 2, the application state of
TAC significantly impacts all evaluation metrics. By activating TAC at appropriate times, SSM avoids
unnecessary computations and time loss, which not only enhances model efficiency but also confirms
the effectiveness of SSM. Although the full application of TAC can maximize mAP accuracy, the
additional time and computational costs involved are not economical."

Dynamic Label Augmentation"
REFERENCES,0.7580174927113703,"C.1
Methodology"
REFERENCES,0.760932944606414,"In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic label matching method to address the limitations of
traditional label matching approaches when processing fixed numbers of event data. Specifically,
the event data acquisition speed is extremely high, while existing datasets typically lack a sufficient
number of labels to match the accumulated fixed-number event data. Therefore, traditional methods
based on fixed time window label assignment are inadequate for scenarios requiring both adaptability
to dynamic scenes and sufficient label coverage. To overcome this limitation, we design a Dynamic
Label Augmentation approach to flexibly assign appropriate labels for each batch of fixed-number
events."
REFERENCES,0.7638483965014577,"In the proposed method, we assume that the fixed number of collected events is 10,000, for which
labels need to be assigned. Suppose there are m labels in the original dataset, with each label
corresponding to a timestamp τm. For each batch of 10,000 events, we first compute the representative
time, defined as the mean timestamp of these events, denoted by tr, where r represents the index of
the current batch of 10,000 events."
REFERENCES,0.7667638483965015,"To achieve dynamic label matching, we introduce a constant γ to control the flexibility of the label
matching time window. Specifically, we define a dynamically adjusted time range γ · ∆t∗, where
∆t∗is a time parameter that varies in real-time based on the dynamics of the events. A label with
a timestamp τm is considered appropriate for the current batch of 10,000 events if it satisfies the
following condition:"
REFERENCES,0.7696793002915452,"tr −γ · ∆t∗≤τm ≤tr + γ · ∆t∗
(13)
Since ∆t∗changes dynamically according to the characteristics of the events, the proposed method
can effectively adapt to variations in the event data, ensuring the accuracy of label assignment."
REFERENCES,0.7725947521865889,"In summary, the Dynamic Label Augmentation method enables flexible adjustment of the time
window, allowing the label assignment process to adapt to different dynamic properties of the events.
This approach avoids potential mismatches associated with traditional fixed time window methods
and exhibits strong robustness and adaptability."

adaptively adjusts the label generation range, shows better adaptability when handling dynamic
scenes, particularly by reducing the risk of label mismatches, thereby potentially enhancing overall
model performance."

violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset)."

7. Experiment Statistical Significance"
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8862973760932945,"Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The experimental results in the paper do not include error bars or other
information about the statistical significance of the experiments."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8892128279883382,Guidelines:
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.892128279883382,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text."

BROADER IMPACTS,0.9416909620991254,Guidelines:
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9446064139941691,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9475218658892128,11. Safeguards
SAFEGUARDS,0.9504373177842566,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?"
SAFEGUARDS,0.9533527696793003,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.956268221574344,Justification: This paper poses no such risks.
SAFEGUARDS,0.9591836734693877,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9620991253644315,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
