ABSTRACT,0.0027247956403269754,"Cross-domain retrieval (CDR) is finding increasingly broad applications across
various domains. However, existing efforts have several major limitations, with the
most critical being their reliance on accurate supervision. Recent studies thus focus
on achieving unsupervised CDR, but they typically assume that the category spaces
across domains are identical, an assumption that is often unrealistic in real-world
scenarios. This is because only through dedicated and comprehensive analysis
can the category composition of a data domain be obtained, which contradicts
the premise of unsupervised scenarios. Therefore, in this work, we introduce the
problem of Universal Unsupervised Cross-Domain Retrieval (U2CDR) for the first
time and design a two-stage semantic feature learning framework to address it. In
the first stage, a cross-domain unified prototypical structure is established under the
guidance of an instance-prototype-mixed contrastive loss and a semantic-enhanced
loss, to counteract category space differences. In the second stage, through a
modified adversarial training mechanism, we ensure minimal changes for the
established prototypical structure during domain alignment, enabling more accurate
nearest-neighbor searching. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and
scenarios, including close-set, partial, and open-set CDR, demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art CDR methods and
other related methods in solving U2CDR challenges."

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.008174386920980926,"In real-world applications, cross-domain retrieval (CDR) finds extensive utility across diverse domains,
such as image search [1], product recommendations [2], and artistic creation [3, 4]. However, the
efficacy of current CDR methods relies heavily on accurate and sufficient supervision [5, 6] to provide
categorical or cross-domain pairing labels. The acquisition of such information demands costly
efforts and resources. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop unsupervised CDR techniques."
INTRODUCTION,0.010899182561307902,"For the regular Unsupervised CDR (UCDR) problem [7, 8], there are two data domains with semantic
similarity but distinct characteristics: the query domain and the retrieval domain. Despite the absence
of category labels, regular UCDR typically assumes that the label spaces of both domains are identical.
However, in real-world applications [5], the categorical composition of an unlabeled data domain is
usually uncertain, which is hard to acquire without detailed analysis and dedicated expertise. In
this work, we focus on extending UCDR to more universal scenarios, which allow for the possibility
of disparate category spaces across domains. The objective of this Universal UCDR (U2CDR) problem
is to retrieve samples from the retrieval domain that share the same category label with a query sample"

"SN M
L",0.05722070844686648,"Two issues must be addressed in solving traditional UCDR: 1) effectively distinguishing data samples
in each domain, and 2) achieving alignment across domains for samples of the same category. For the
first issue, self-supervised learning [9, 10] (SSL) is employed independently within each domain. For
the second, many nearest-neighbor searching algorithms may apply. However, for U2CDR, applying
these existing methods introduces new challenges. First, the prevailing SSL methods, particularly
contrastive learning [9, 11, 10], are highly influenced by the category label space [12], which means
different label spaces lead to distinct semantic structures. Second, existing nearest-neighbor searching
algorithms [13, 14, 7] overlook the presence of domain gaps. We found that only by first addressing
the domain gap can the nearest neighbor searching become reliable and accurate."
"SN M
L",0.05994550408719346,"Thus, to effectively address the above challenges in solving U2CDR, we propose a two-stage Unified,
Enhanced, and Matched (UEM) semantic feature learning framework, as in Figure 1. In the first stage,
we establish a cross-domain unified prototypical structure with an instance-prototype-mixed (IPM)
contrastive loss, accompanied by a semantic-enhanced loss (SEL). In the second stage, before con-
ducting cross-domain category alignment, we incorporate Semantic-Preserving Domain Alignment
(SPDA) to diminish the domain gap while ensuring minimal changes for the established prototypical
structure. As the domain gap diminishes, we propose Switchable Nearest Neighboring Match (SN2M),
to select more reliable cross-domain neighbors based on the relationship between instances and
prototypes. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method can substantially outperform state-of-the-art methods from UCDR and other related
problems. In addition, we also theoretically analyze the principles behind the major challenges of
U2CDR and the design intuition of UEM. In summary, this work made the following contributions:"

RELATED WORK,0.07629427792915532,"more recent works [7, 8, 17] focus on achieving unsupervised CDR (UCDR). CDS [14] proposes
a contrastive learning-based cross-domain pre-training to align different domains. PCS [13] incor-

search ways like clustering [7], pseudo-labeling [18], classifier mixup [17], and data augmentation [8]
to achieve more advanced CDR. However, all these UCDR works assume that the query and retrieval
domains share the same category space. Although there is a study [19] that can achieve CDR with
distinct categories, its effectiveness relies on accurate and sufficient data labels."
RELATED WORK,0.07901907356948229,"Universal Cross-Domain Learning. Cross-domain learning consists of domain adaptation (DA)
and domain generalization (DG) [20]. Regular DA and DG also only consider the scenario where
the label space of the target domain is the same as the source label space, which is termed Close-
set DA/DG. Recently, more studies have realized that the target label space may be a subset of
the source one (i.e., Partial DA/DG) [21, 22] or contain some private labels that other domains
do not have (i.e., Open-set DA/DG) [23, 24]. To deal with more universal setups, UniDA [25]
unifies entropy and domain similarity to quantify sample transferability across domains. CMU [26]
extends transferability quantification into entropy, consistency, and confidence. More recent works
search ways like clustering [27, 28] and nearest neighbor matching [29, 30] to achieve universal
DA/DG. In addition, some studies appear to achieve unsupervised DG where the source domain is
also unlabeled [31, 32], which is similar to the setup of UCDR. However, these studies consider
the classification task and cannot effectively work in image retrieval, especially in completely
unsupervised cases."

domain gap needs to be diminished. Existing works usually leverage discrepancy minimization [35]

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.4359673024523161,"In this work, we focus on two major challenges when conducting cross-domain retrieval (CDR) in
real-world scenarios: one is that the category space across domains is usually distinct, and the other
is that both the query and retrieval domains are unlabeled. To tackle these challenges, we propose
a Unified, Enhanced, and Matched (UEM) semantic feature learning framework that can establish a
unified semantic structure across domains and preserve this structure during categorical matching.
Extensive experiments in cases including close-set, partial, open-set unsupervised CDR on multiple
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of UEM, which are reflected in the substantial

Limitations and Future Work"
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK,0.44141689373297005,"To solve the real-world challenges when employing cross-domain retrieval, especially considering
the category distinctness across unsupervised data domains, we propose the UEM semantic feature
learning framework in this work. Although extensive empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis
have validated the effectiveness of UEM, some minor limitations still need more exploration. First, the
current UEM framework is composed of two stages, and we empirically determine the switching point.
In the future, we need to achieve a real end-to-end UEM by changing the training stage automatically.
Besides, there is a lack of theoretical analysis for the second stage (CDSM). In future efforts, we
should theoretically prove the semantic preservation of SPDA and the reliability of SN2M. Lastly, the
general applicability of UEM also needs testing. For instance, cross-person generalization in wearable
devices [42] and property analysis of material [43] or molecular [44] structures require cross-domain
retrieval. Therefore, we should test UEM on other modalities like time series and graph data."

Open-set Query Label Detection"

(CDRL) [14, 13] and unsupervised domain generalization (UDG) [31, 32]. For CDRL, the objective
is to learn domain-generalizable representations that provide domain-transferable knowledge for any
downstream task. One of the most typical downstream tasks of CDRL is cross-domain retrieval. As for
UDG, in addition to achieving effective cross-domain representation learning, domain-generalizable
classifiers are also needed. However, in our evaluation, the retrieval process does not require any
classifier, thus we omit all techniques related to classifier training for the used UDG approaches."
REFERENCES,0.7166212534059946,"For the specific setups of our experiments, we consider close-set, partial, and open-set UCDR. The
close-set UCDR assumes that the label spaces of the query and retrieval domains are identical, which
is the benchmark setup of other baseline methods. In this case, we follow the default settings of these
baseline methods to evaluate their performance in close-set UCDR. As for the partial UCDR, the
label space of the query domain is half of the retrieval label space, where most baseline methods
can work normally without any modification. But some baseline approaches (PCS [13], UCDIR [7],
DGDIR [8]), especially those based on prototype learning, require the knowledge of category numbers
for domains, therefore, we suppose the category numbers are known to these approaches. The last
open-set UCDR supposes the retrieval label space is half of the query label space. In this setup, the
query domain has private categories, and if we conduct retrieval for samples from these categories,
the retrieval results should be null. To detect private categories, we follow the strategy leveraged by
UEM (Section B.1) to employ a similar one for the used baseline methods. Specifically, we divide
all baseline methods into two groups by whether there is a dedicated nearest neighboring searching
algorithm. For those (DARL [31]) that don’t have the nearest neighboring search, we attach the
searching algorithm used by UCDIR [7]. After conducting all training and operations of any baseline
method, we use the nearest neighboring search to pair samples from the query and retrieval domains.
Moreover, we conduct K-Means in the query domain to build the prototype set PA (for CoDA [17],
we leverage its auxiliary classifiers to construct the prototype set). Then for each cluster in the query
domain, we record the maximum inter-sample distance DA
c . Note that the distance measurement
here is different from the product of minus cosine similarity and Euclidean distance (Eq. (25)),
and different approaches use diverse measurement, e.g., UCDIR [7] uses cosine similarity while
DN2A [32] leverages Euclidean distance."

Moreover, UEM can exceed all other baseline methods much more substantially in both partial and

DomainNet and 12.0% on Office-31 in partial UCDR. As for open-set UCDR, UEM exceeds other

Broader Impact"
REFERENCES,0.7656675749318801,"The research development for solving Universal Unsupervised Cross-Domain Retrieval (U2CDR)
has the potential to make a significant positive impact across various sectors. By enabling more
accurate and flexible retrieval of information across different domains without the need for supervision
and the concern about semantic category distinctness, our proposed UEM framework can enhance
user experiences in product recommendation systems, leading to more personalized and relevant
suggestions. In the realm of artistic creation, UEM can facilitate novel connections and inspirations
by retrieving cross-domain artistic elements, fostering creativity and innovation. Beyond these
applications, UEM can also be beneficial in healthcare, finance, and scientific research with certain
adaptive modifications. In healthcare, it can improve diagnostic tools and personalized treatment
plans by integrating diverse data sources. In finance, it can enhance risk assessment and fraud
detection by analyzing cross-domain financial data. In scientific research, it can accelerate discoveries
by connecting insights from different fields. While UEM has substantial benefits, it is crucial that its
deployment adheres to existing privacy and intellectual property protection regulations and policies.
Ensuring that data used in cross-domain retrieval respects user privacy and intellectual property rights
is essential to prevent misuse and maintain public trust. Thus, applying this research in the real world
should consider ethical issues to ensure responsible and fair use, thereby aiming for a positive societal
impact without any negative social consequences."

one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8474114441416893,"(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code"
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8501362397820164,"Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We are checking the relevant regulations of our institutions to release the
source code. All the datasets used for this work are publicly available.
Guidelines:"
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8528610354223434,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details"
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8555858310626703,"Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All the experiment details are given in Section 4 and the Appendix.
Guidelines:"
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8583106267029973,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance"
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8610354223433242,"Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?"
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8637602179836512,"Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All the experiment results are supplemented with standard deviations as the
error bar resulting from 3 independent runs."
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8664850136239782,Guidelines:
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8692098092643051,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text."

• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper)."

deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction)."
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9046321525885559,10. Broader Impacts
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9073569482288828,"Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?"

BROADER IMPACTS,0.9128065395095368,Justification: The broader impacts are discussed in Section D of the Appendix.
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9155313351498637,Guidelines:
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9182561307901907,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9209809264305178,11. Safeguards
SAFEGUARDS,0.9237057220708447,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?"
SAFEGUARDS,0.9264305177111717,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.9291553133514986,"Justification: Our work does not pose any explicit risks as we use public datasets, and
applying our proposed methods to other areas needs dedicated modifications."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9318801089918256,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9346049046321526,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
