ABSTRACT,0.005847953216374269,"The abductive natural language inference task (αNLI) is proposed to infer the
most plausible explanation between the cause and the event. In the αNLI task,
two observations are given, and the most plausible hypothesis is asked to pick out
from the candidates. Existing methods model the relation between each candidate
hypothesis separately and penalize the inference network uniformly. In this pa-
per, we argue that it is unnecessary to distinguish the reasoning abilities among
correct hypotheses; and similarly, all wrong hypotheses contribute the same when
explaining the reasons of the observations. Therefore, we propose to group in-
stead of ranking the hypotheses and design a structural loss called “joint softmax
focal loss” in this paper. Based on the observation that the hypotheses are gen-
erally semantically related, we have designed a novel interactive language model
aiming at exploiting the rich interaction among competing hypotheses. We name
this new model for αNLI: Interactive Model with Structural Loss (IMSL). The
experimental results show that our IMSL has achieved the highest performance
on the RoBERTa-large pretrained model, with ACC and AUC results increased by
about 1% and 5% respectively."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.017543859649122806,"Abductive natural language inference (αNLI) (Bhagavatula et al. (2020)) is a newly established
branch of natural language inference (NLI) and is an interesting task in the area of natural language
processing (NLP) based commonsense reasoning. Originating from NLI which targets at the seman-
tic relationship between the two sentences, αNLI further estimates the abductive reasoning of each
sentence by explicitly deducing its cause. In the past years, αNLI has attracted increasing attentions
as it makes NLP tools more explainable and comprehensible. As of today, typical applications of
αNLI include knowledge graph Completion (Yu et al. (2020)) (Bauer & Bansal (2021)), question
answering (Ma et al. (2021)), sentence in-ﬁlling (Huang et al. (2020)), knowledge integration (Zhou
et al. (2021)) and so on."
INTRODUCTION,0.023391812865497075,"To better motivate this work, we have shown a comparison between NLI and αNLI in Table 1.
For NLI, the task is to judge the relationship between the premise statement P and the hypothetical
sentence H based on the given information in P. Options of the answer can be implication, neutrality,
or contradiction. For αNLI, a pair of observations (O1 and O2) and some hypotheses (e.g., two
competing hypotheses H1 and H2 in the example) are given. The task of αNLI is to deduce the
more plausible reason between H1 and H2 that can explain the situational change from O1 to O2.
In addition to constructing the αNLI task, the authors of (Bhagavatula et al. (2020)) has released a
new challenge data set, called ART and reported comprehensive baseline performance for αNLI by
directly employing and retraining a solution for NLI, i.e., ESIM+ELMo(Chen et al. (2017), Peters
et al. (2018)). They also found that the pretrained language model can apparently inﬂuence the
performance of an algorithm and demonstrated some test results with the latest language models
like GPT(Radford et al. (2018)) and BERT(Devlin et al. (2019))."
INTRODUCTION,0.029239766081871343,"We note that there is still a considerable gap between the human performance and the class of base-
line models in (Bhagavatula et al. (2020)). More recently, (Zhu et al. (2020)) argued that the former
framework cannot measure the rationality of the hypotheses, and reformulated αNLI as a learning-
to-rank task for abductive reasoning. In their approach, RoBERTa(Liu et al. (2019)), BERT(Devlin
et al. (2019)), and ESIM(Chen et al. (2017)) are all tested to work as the pretrained language model."

and is capable of reﬁning the input representation in a recursive manner for αNLI."
INTRODUCTION,0.1111111111111111,"Despite the performance improvement achieved by the ranking framework, there are still some
weaknesses calling for further investigation. For instance, a practical training sample (e.g., two
observations and four hypotheses) from ART is shown in Figure 1. It is easy to conclude that
both H1 and H2 are correct answers; while the other two (H3, H4) are false. However, in previous
ranking-based αNLI method such as L2R2 (Learning to Rank for Reasoning) (Zhu et al., 2020, four
hypotheses will be trained simultaneously by treating one of the two correct answers as a more cor-
rect one. Similarly, the wrong answers are also treated as a wrong one and a worse one. Meanwhile,
the ranked hypotheses are trained separately, but the sum of their probabilities is set as a ﬁxed value -
e.g., the probability of correct hypothesis H2 decreases when the probability of answer H1 increases."

INTRODUCTION,0.14619883040935672,"In this paper, we advocate a new approach for αNLI as shown in Figure 1. Our principle of abductive
reasoning is constructed based on following two arguments: 1) a hypothesis is correct because its
meaning explains the change of the observations. In practice, the causes of situational changes
are often diverse, and therefore the answers are seldom unique. It follows that we do not need
to intentionally distinguish or rank the correct answers. 2) a hypothesis is wrong because it can
not explain the cause of some event. Therefore, all wrong answers contribute the same - i.e., it is
plausible to treat all wrong hypotheses equally in the process of constructing our reasoning network.
We argue that the proposed abductive reasoning principle is closer to commonsense reasoning by
humans than previous ranking-based approaches."
INTRODUCTION,0.15204678362573099,"Based on the above reasoning, we propose a new abductive reasoning model called Interactive Model

INTRODUCTION,0.19883040935672514,"of extracting the language features of an arbitrary hypothesis, its relationship to other hypotheses
should also be considered because the hypotheses are often semantically related Pearl (1986). To
this end, we can design an information interaction layer to capture the relationship between different
hypotheses and produce more discriminative language feature vectors. On the other hand, we have
constructed a new loss function called “joint softmax focal loss” inspired by a recent work (Lin et al.
(2017)). It is essentially a structural softmax based Focal loss formed by sequentially constructing
a loss for each score group that composed by a correct hypothesis and all wrong hypotheses. When
compared with conventional models, we argue that IMSL is more powerful for the task of αNLI by
jointly exploiting the rich relation among competing hypotheses. The main technical contributions
of this work can be summarized as follows."
INTRODUCTION,0.2046783625730994,"1) For αNLI task, we claim that, the correct hypotheses of a given observation pair are often diverse,
and there is no need to tell them apart. The wrong hypotheses contribute the same to the task. We
regroup instead of ranking all hypotheses, as shown in Figure 1."
INTRODUCTION,0.21052631578947367,"2) Aiming at the problem of incorrect probability distribution between correct hypotheses in the
training process, a joint softmax focal loss is proposed. For the hypotheses groups formed in the
rearrange process, we design a softmax-based focal loss for each group and combine them into a
joint loss."
INTRODUCTION,0.21637426900584794,"3) In view of the problem that traditional models cannot capture the language relationship between
different hypotheses, we have added an information interaction layer between different hypothesis
models. The information interaction layer increases the area under the receiver’s operating charac-
teristic curve (AUC) by about 5%."
INTRODUCTION,0.2222222222222222,"4) Impressive abductive reasoning performance is achieved by IMSL when tested using RoBERTa
as the pretrained language model. The best language model DeBERTa (He et al. (2021)) is not
tested due to the constraint by our limited GPU resources (4-piece RXT 2080Ti). In our experiment,
compared with all recent algorithms whose codes have been made publicly available, the IMSL
method has achieved state-of-the-art results in ACC and AUC on both the validation set and test
set. Besides, on the public leaderboard1, IMSL is the best non-DeBERTa based algorithm and ranks
4/56 in all (including both DeBERTa based and non-DeBERTa based) competing methods."

to ﬁnd the most reasonable explanation of the incomplete observations, (Bhagavatula et al. (2020))
studied the feasibility of language-based abductive reasoning and proposed the task of αNLI. It pays
more attention to the information provided in the premise than the RTE task. For traditional RTE, the
main task is to judge the relationship between the premise sentence and the hypothetical sentence,
but the main objective of αNLI is to select the most plausible hypothesis among the hypotheses
given two observations."
RELATED WORK,0.2573099415204678,"αNLI is the ﬁrst language-based abductive reasoning study. This shift from logic-based to language-
based reasoning draws inspirations from a signiﬁcant body of works on language-based entailment
(Bowman et al. (2015); Williams et al. (2018)), language-based logic (Lakoff (1970); MacCartney &
Manning (2007)), and language-based commonsense reasoning (Mostafazadeh et al. (2016); Zellers
et al. (2018)). In addition to establish αNLI, (Dagan et al. (2005)) have also released a new challenge
dataset, i.e., ART, which can be visited through the ﬁrst footnote in this paper. The authors have
also formulate the task as a multiple-choice task to support easy and reliable automatic evaluation.
Speciﬁcally, from a given context, the task is to choose the more reliable explanation from a given
pair of hypotheses choices."
RELATED WORK,0.2631578947368421,"However, discriminating correct from wrong does not measure the plausibility of a hypothesis in
αNLI (Zhu et al. (2020)). So, to fully model the plausibility of the hypotheses, Zhu et al. turn to
the perspective of ranking and propose a novel learning to rank for reasoning (L2R2) approach for
the task. The authors rank the hypotheses based on the number of times they appear in the dataset,
and use some pairwise rankings as well as a listwise ranking as loss. Pairwise rankings contains
Ranking SVM (Herbrich et al. (2000)), RankNet(Burges et al. (2005)), LambdaRank(Burges et al.
(2006)), and Listwise Ranking contains ListNet(Cao et al. (2007)), ListMLE (Li et al. (2020)) and
ApproxNDCG(Qin et al. (2010)). The experiments on the ART dataset show that reformulating the
αNLI task as ranking task really brings obvious improvements. After that, (Paul & Frank (2020))
proposes a novel multi-head knowledge attention model that encodes semi-structured commonsense
inference rules and learns to incorporate them in a transformer based reasoning cell. The authors
still prove that a model using counterfactual reasoning is useful for predicting abductive reasoning
tasks. Accordingly, they have established a new task called Counterfactual Invariance Prediction
(CIP) and provide a new dataset for this."
RELATED WORK,0.26900584795321636,"In addition to the abductive reasoning models, the pre-trained language model still plays an impor-
tant role in αNLI task. Early ways for language inference are constructed directly by some simple
statistical measures like bag-of-words and word matching. Later, various kinds of neural network
architectures are used to discover useful features in the languages, like word2vec(Mikolov et al.
(2013)) and GloVe(Pennington et al. (2014)). Recent works have developed contextual word rep-
resentation models, e.g.,Embeddings from Language Models (ELMO) by Peters et al. (2018) and
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT) by Devlin et al. (2019). The orig-
inal implementation and architecture of BERT has been outperformed by several variants and other
transformer-based models, such as RoBERTa, DeBERTa and UNIMO. RoBERTa(Liu et al. (2019))
replaces training method of BERT and uses larger batches and more data for training. DeBERTa(He
et al. (2021)) uses the disentangled attention mechanism and an enhanced mask decoder to improves
the BERT and RoBERTa models. In order to effectively adapt to unimodal and multimodal under-
standing task, Li et al. (2021) proposes the UNIMO model. In this paper, however, restricted by our
computing resources, RoBERTa is selected as our language model."

with these high-performing yet computationally demanding pretrained models."
EXPERIMENT,0.5555555555555556,"Evaluation indicators: AUC and ACC are the most common evaluation indicators. Since the
original ACC cannot evaluate the model that is far away from the test data, AUC is added as an
additional evaluation index to handle skewed sample distribution. AUC is a measurement method
that is statistically consistent and more discriminative than ACC."

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP"
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.5672514619883041,"Tasks and settings: The αNLI task uses the ART dataset, which is the ﬁrst large-scale benchmark
dataset used for abductive reasoning in narrative texts. It consists of about 20,000 observations and
about 200,000 pairs of hypotheses. The observations come from a collection of manually curated
stories, and the hypotheses are collected through crowdsourcing. In addition, the candidate hypothe-
ses for each narrative context in the test set are selected through the adversarial ﬁltering algorithm
with BERT-L (Large) as the opponent. The input and output formats are shown in Table 2."

the amount of training data will vary. For different training data, select the hyperparameter that
produces the best performance on the test set. Speciﬁcally, the learning rate is ﬁxed at 1e-6, the
batch size is ﬁxed at 1, and the training batch will vary with the amount of training data. Training

the results of ﬁve different seeds to evaluate the performance of the test set."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.5906432748538012,"Baseline: We have used the following four baseline models for comparison: A) BERT (Devlin et al.,
2019) is a language model that uses a masked language model and predicts the next sentence as the
target training. For example, it masks certain words in the input, and then trains it and predicts
the words that are blocked. B) RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has the same structure as BERT, but
there is no prediction (NSP) for the next sentence. RoBERTa-B (ase) and RoBERTa-L (arge) use
more data and larger batches for training. C) Learning to Rank for Reasoning (L2R2) Zhu et al.
(2020) reprogrammed the αNLI task as a ranking problem, using a learning ranking framework that
includes a score function and a loss function. D) Multi-Head Knowledge Attention (MHKA) (Paul
& Frank, 2020) proposed a new multihead knowledge attention model, and used a novel knowledge
integration technology."

Figure 5 shows how the model improves on MHKA, RoBERTa-Large, and L2R2. The experimental
results show that the model in this paper can achieve better results in the case of low resource setting.
When using 1% training data only, the improvement brought by IMSL is the most signiﬁcant, which

hyperparameters of the balancing factor and the focusing parameter. The focusing parameter γ in

rapidly focus the model on hard examples; while the balancing factor 0 < a < 1 in Eq. equation 4

performance of IMSL model with different focusing parameters and balance factors. In this study,

SUMMARY"
SUMMARY,0.783625730994152,"In this paper, an IMSL method is proposed for commonsense abductive reasoning. It includes an
information interaction layer that captures the relationship between different hypotheses, and a joint
loss for our proposed way of grouping the correct/wrong hypotheses. Experimental results show that
on αNLI tasks, IMSL has better performance on ACC and AUC, especially in low-resource settings,
IMSL can signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy."
