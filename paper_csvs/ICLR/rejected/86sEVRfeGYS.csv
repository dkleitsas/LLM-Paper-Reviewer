ABSTRACT,0.003952569169960474,"The Backprop algorithm for learning in neural networks utilizes two mechanisms:
ﬁrst, stochastic gradient descent and second, initialization with small random
weights, where the latter is essential to the effectiveness of the former. We show
that in continual learning setups, Backprop performs well initially, but over time
its performance degrades. Stochastic gradient descent alone is insufﬁcient to learn
continually; the initial randomness enables only initial learning but not continual
learning. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst result showing this degra-
dation in Backprop’s ability to learn. To address this issue, we propose an algo-
rithm that continually injects random features alongside gradient descent using a
new generate-and-test process. We call this the Continual Backprop algorithm.
We show that, unlike Backprop, Continual Backprop is able to continually adapt
in both supervised and reinforcement learning (RL) problems. We expect that as
continual learning becomes more common in future applications, a method like
Continual Backprop will be essential where the advantages of random initializa-
tion are present throughout learning."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.011857707509881422,"In the last decade, deep learning methods have been successful and become the state-of-the-art in
many machine learning problems and applications, including supervised classiﬁcation, reinforce-
ment learning (Silver et al., 2016), computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), and natural language
processing (Brown et al., 2020). These methods learn the weights of an artiﬁcial neural network
using Backprop, which is primarily applied to stationary problems. However, a primary challenge
to leveraging the strengths of deep learning beyond current applications is that Backprop does not
work well in non-stationary problems (McCloskey and Cohen, 1989; French, 1997; Sahoo et al.,
2018), for example, a problem that consists a sequence of stationary problems."
INTRODUCTION,0.015810276679841896,"Leveraging the strengths of deep learning methods in non-stationary problems is important as
many real-world applications of machine learning like robotics involve non-stationrities.
Non-
stationarities can arise due to changes in the environment (Thurn, 1998), high complexity (Sutton et
al., 2007), partial observability (Khetarpal et al., 2020), or other actors (Foerster et al., 2018). Many
works have tried to make deep learning work in non-stationary problems. Some works have pro-
posed methods that can remember previously learned information (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Aljundi
et al., 2018; Riemer et al., 2019). While, others have proposed methods that can adapt fast to non-
stationarities (Rusu et al., 2016; Al-Shedivat et al., 2018; Finn et al., 2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.019762845849802372,"A limitation of prior works on non-stationary problems is that they did not study cases where there
are many non-stationarities. Number of non-stationarities refers to the number of times the data
distribution changes. Most works only look at problems with less than ten non-stationarities (Rusu et
al., 2016; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Al-Shedivat et al., 2018). Finn et al. (2019) studied problems with
up to a hundred non-stationarities. Dealing with many non-stationarities is important for systems
that continually interact with the real world as non-stationarities frequently occur in the world."
INTRODUCTION,0.023715415019762844,"In this work, we study problems with a large number (thousands) of non-stationarities. We start
with a special class of problems that we call semi-stationary problems. These are online super-
vised learning problems where the input distribution is non-stationary while the target function is
stationary. The target function is the function being approximated, for example, the true regression
function. These problems are a natural way to study problems with many non-stationarities; slowly"

INTRODUCTION,0.03162055335968379,"moving through a large input space can cause thousands of non-stationarities. These problems are
also important for systems in the real world as inputs from the real world often depend on previous
inputs, making the input distribution non-stationary. Finally, we study non-stationary RL problems.
These are full non-stationarity problems as the input distribution changes when the agent’s behaviour
changes and the target function, optimal policy, changes as the dynamics of the environment change."
INTRODUCTION,0.03557312252964427,"Semi-stationary problems reveal a new difﬁculty with Backprop(BP) in non-stationary problems;
they help us clearly understand one way in which Backprop fails. We show that in non-stationary
problems, Backprop performs well initially, but surprisingly, its performance degrades substantially
over time as Backprop loses its ability to adapt. Backprop relies on proper random initialization for
its effectiveness (Glorot et al., 2010; Sutskerver et al., 2013; He et al., 2015). However, randomiza-
tion in Backprop only happens in the beginning. We hypothesize that Backprop’s ability to adapt
degrades because the beneﬁts of initial random distribution are not present at all times."
INTRODUCTION,0.039525691699604744,"To extend the beneﬁts of initial random distribution throughout learning, we propose the Contin-
ual Backprop (CBP) algorithm. CBP uses a generate-and-test method to continually inject random
features alongside SGD. We show that unlike BP, CBP can continually adapt in non-stationary prob-
lems. Our generate-and-test algorithm consists of two parts: the generator, which proposes new
features,and the second is the tester, which ﬁnds and replaces low utility features with the features
proposed by the generator. Our generate-and-test algorithm is built on the one proposed by Mah-
mood and Sutton, (2013) and our algorithm is compatible with modern deep learning. We overcome
three signiﬁcant limitations of their work. First, our algorithm is applicable to feed-forward net-
works with arbitrary shape and size while theirs was only applicable to networks with a single hid-
den layer and one output. Second, our algorithms works with modern activations and optimizers like
Adam while theirs was limited to LTU activations, binary weights, and SGD. And third, we combine
generate-and-test with SGD and show that the resulting algorithm, CBP, is signiﬁcantly better than
BP in complex non-stationary problems while their work was an isolated study of generate-and-test."
INTRODUCTION,0.043478260869565216,"The ﬁrst contribution of our work is to show that in non-stationary problems with many non-
stationarities BP loses its ability to adapt over time. In other words, we contribute to the under-
standing of why BP and its variants fails in non-stationary problems. Our second contribution is that
we propose the CBP algorithm that extends the beneﬁts of the initialization in BP to all times."

inforcement Learning (RL) problems. First, we consider a novel idealized semi-stationary problem.
The strength of this problem is that in this problem we can study continual learning algorithms ex-
tensively and yet in a computationally inexpensive way and without the confounders that arise in
more complex problems. Then we study the permuted MNIST problem, an online image classiﬁ-
cation problem, and two non-stationary RL problems. We demonstrate on these problems that the

NON-STATIONARY PROBLEMS,0.05928853754940711,"In supervised learning, the task is to learn a function using examples of input-output pairs. This
function is called the target function. In online supervised learning (Orabona, 2019), there is a
stream of samples (xt, yt), and the predictions have to be made sequentially. The performance
measure is the loss on the next sample. Thus, learning and evaluation happen simultaneously. This
is fundamentally different from ofﬂine supervised learning, where there are two separate phases,
one for learning and another for evaluation. Another common measure in non-stationary problems
is the performance on previously seen data. However, measuring performance on previously seen
data is only meaningful when studying the catastrophic forgetting aspect of BP. As we do not study
the forgetting problem, we do not measure the performance on old data."

best approximation continually changes in this problem as the input distribution is non-stationary,
and the target function has high complexity. Therefore, there is a need for continual adaptation."

tester that ﬁnds low utility features and replaces them with features proposed by the generator. Our

contribution to the next feature is small, it can be overwhelmed by contributions from other features.
Then the current feature is not useful for the consumer. The same measure of connection utility was
proposed by Hu et al. (2016) for the network pruning problem. We deﬁne the contribution-utility of a

algorithmic perspective. The Backprop algorithm, as proposed by Rumelhart et al. (1987), had two
parts, initialization and gradient descent. However, initialization only happens initially, so Backprop
is not a continual algorithm as it does not do similar computation at all times. On the other hand,
CBP is continual as it performs similar computation at all times."

Adam has an upper bound on the weight change in a single

RELATED WORKS"
RELATED WORKS,0.44664031620553357,"Continual learning or lifelong learning has been studied for a long time from several different per-
spectives. Ring (1998) considered it as a reinforcement learning problem in a non-Markovian en-
vironment. On the other hand, Caruana (1998) considered it as a sequence of tasks. There are two
major goals in continual learning: memorizing useful information and adapting to the changes in the
data stream changes by ﬁnding new useful information. Memorizing useful information is difﬁcult
for current deep-learning methods as they tend to forget previously learned information (McCloskey
and Cohen, 1989; French, 1997; Parisi et al.,2019). Various ingenious methods have been proposed
to tackle the forgetting issue (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Aljundi et al., 2018; Riemer et al., 2019; Javed
et al., 2019); however, it still remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we focused on continually
ﬁnding useful information but not on remembering useful information."
RELATED WORKS,0.4505928853754941,"Multiple recent works have focused on adapting to the changes in the data stream by ﬁnding new
useful information (Rusu et al. 2016; Finn et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Nagabandi et al., 2019;
Finn et al., 2019). However, none of the prior works studied problems with thousands of non-
stationarities. The problem settings in most works were ofﬂine as they had two separate phases, one
for learning and the other for evaluation. And in the evaluation phase, there were only a handful
of non-stationarities. On the other hand, Finn et al. (2019) studied the fully online problem setting.
Although this works investigated the interesting, fully online case, there were still a small number
of non-stationarities. Also, the algorithms proposed by Finn et al. (2019) are not scalable as they
require storing all the data seen so far. The closest work to ours is by Rahman (2021), where they
studied learning in supervised learning problems where the target function changes over time."
RELATED WORKS,0.45454545454545453,"Prior works on the importance of initialization have focused on ﬁnding the correct weight magnitude
to initialize the weights. Glorot et al. (2010) showed that it is essential to initialize the weights so
that the gradients do not become exponentially small in the initial layers of a network with sigmoid
activations. Sutskever et al. (2013) showed that initialization with small weights is critical for sig-
moid activations as they may saturate if the weights are too large. More recent work (He et al., 2015)
has gone into ensuring that the input signal’s scale of magnitude is preserved across the layers in a
deep network. Despite all these works on the importance of initialization, the fact that its beneﬁts
are only present in the beginning but not continually has been overlooked as most of these works
focused on ofﬂine learning, where learning has to be done just once."

CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS"
CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS,0.4624505928853755,"In this work, we studied learning problems that have a large number of non-stationarities. We
showed that in these problems, the performance of Backprop degrades over time, and it loses its
ability to adapt. In other words, we showed that neural networks have a “decaying plasticity” prob-
lem. Ours is the ﬁrst result showing this degradation in Backprop’s ability to adapt. This result
means that Backprop can be unsuitable for continual adaptation."
CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS,0.466403162055336,"We proposed the Continual Backprop (CBP) algorithm to get a robust continual learning algorithm
where both components of Backprop are present continually. CBP extends the beneﬁts of special
random initialization throughout learning using a generate-and-test process. Our generate-and-test
algorithm is the ﬁrst one that is compatible with modern deep learning. We showed that CBP could
continually adapt even after thousands of non-stationarities. Additionally, we showed that Backprop
with L2 regularization is also able to adapt continually in some problems, but it fails in many others."
CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS,0.47035573122529645,"The main limitation of our work is that our tester is based on heuristics. Even though it performs
well, future work on more principled testers will improve the foundations of Continual Backprop.
Continual learning is becoming more and more relevant in machine learning. These systems can not
use Backprop or its variants in their current form, as they are not stable in non-stationary problems.
We expect that by establishing Backprop’s degrading adaptivity, our work will invite many solutions
similar to how many works have addressed “catastrophic forgetting”. We foresee that our work will
open a path for better Continual Backprop algorithms."

ETHICS STATEMENT,0.4782608695652174,"Ethics Statement: In this work, we did fundamental research in continual learning. In the long term,
our work may help develop continually learn systems for the real world. Continual learning can
enable learning systems that scale with data and experience under constant memory requirements.
This scaling will make learning systems accessible to a large part of the population, who lack easy
access to massive computation, which is essential for current AI systems. Continual learning can
also enable learning in remote locations where current expensive methods face difﬁculty due to
limited on-site connectivity and memory resource. As for any potential negative impacts, they are
not unique to our work, and instead, they will be shared with other works on continual learning."
