ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.003003003003003003,"Transformer has become ubiquitous in sequence modeling tasks. As a key com-
ponent of Transformer, self-attention does not scale to long sequences due to its
quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. To tackle
this problem, recent work developed dynamic attention sparsiﬁcation techniques
based on Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) methods, where similar queries
and keys are allocated to the same hash bucket with high probability. However,
the effectiveness of those ANN methods relies on the assumption that queries and
keys should lie in the same space, which is not well justiﬁed. Besides, some of
the ANN methods such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are randomized and
cannot fully utilize the available real data distributions. To overcome these issues,
this paper proposes a new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learning-
to-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions
for queries and keys, respectively. Another advantage of LHA is that it does not
impose extra constraints for queries and keys, which makes it applicable to the
wide range of pre-trained Transformer models. Our experiments on evaluation of
the WikiText-103 dataset for language modeling, the GLUE benchmark for natural
language understanding, and the Lang-Range-Arena benchmark for multiple tasks
(text/image classiﬁcation, retrieval, etc.) show the superior performance of LHA
over other strong Transformer variants."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.009009009009009009,"The Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) has been successfully applied to various tasks,
including natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019;
Liu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019), computer vision (Carion et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020),
and time series forecasting (Zhou et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021). Such a success is mainly due to the
self-attention component, which enables each token to directly interact with any other tokens in the
entire sequence. But self-attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the
sequence length and hence does not scale efﬁciently to long sequences as a result."
INTRODUCTION,0.012012012012012012,"To address this inefﬁciency problem, one of the solutions is to approximate the full attention matrix
with a sparse one, as the softmax operation is dominated by the largest elements. Some recent efforts
focus on dynamic learning of sparse attention patterns via Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)
approaches, including Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) (Kitaev et al., 2020; Daras et al., 2020) and
mini-batch spherical k-means (Roy et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020a). The queries and keys are hashed
or clustered into different buckets, hoping that the queries and keys in the same bucket are similar
with a high probability. The effectiveness of those ANN approaches rely on the assumption that the
(transformed) query and key vectors should lie in the same space, which could be sub-optimal in
dealing with different sparsity patterns, as analyzed in this paper (Section 3.2). Besides, the hash
functions in LSH are randomized and data-agnostic, which cannot fully utilize the rich information in
real-world data distributions."
INTRODUCTION,0.015015015015015015,"In this paper, we address the above limitations of existing ANN-based methods for attention sparsi-
ﬁcation. Firstly, we analyze two imbalance issues in LSH-produced sparse attention patterns, i.e.,
unbalanced hash bucket sizes and unbalanced query-key ratios. Secondly, we design a new metric
called attention utility to quantify how well the sparse patterns approximate the full attention, and
we show that ANN-derived sparse patterns are substantially inferior to their counterparts. Thirdly,
we propose a novel solution, namely Learning-to-Hash Attention (LHA), for dynamic attention"

INTRODUCTION,0.021021021021021023,"sparsiﬁcation with enhanced model expressiveness. LHA directly optimizes our newly deﬁned
attention utility metric in an end-to-end manner via separate learnable hash functions for queries and
keys, respectively. As for reducing the computational complexity in the training phase, LHA uses
unbiased kernelized attention techniques (Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021) to efﬁciently
approximate the attention utilities. Similar to other sparse attention models (Kitaev et al., 2020;
Roy et al., 2021), LHA reduces the overall complexity of self-attention from O(N 2) to O(N 1.5)
for sequence length N. Our experiments in a wide range of tasks on the evaluation benchmarks for
language modeling, natural language understanding, and Long-Range-Arena show that LHA achieves
better performance compared to strong transformer baselines."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.02702702702702703,"Related work can be roughly divided into three categories, i.e., location-based sparse attention,
content-based sparse attention, and dense approximation of attention, as outlined below."
RELATED WORK,0.03003003003003003,"Location-based sparse attention methods aim to improve the computational efﬁciency by using
pre-speciﬁed global or local sparsiﬁcation patterns over token locations. Liu et al. (2018) proposed
to alternate coarse attention layers and local attention layers. Child et al. (2019) used a strided
sparse attention pattern in image generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) imposed sparsity based on the
predicted temporal window size for each token. Other methods (Zhang et al., 2021; Beltagy et al.,
2020; Ainslie et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020) used a pre-speciﬁed subset of locations in the input
as the global memory, and only allow non-local attentions from this subset to all the other tokens.
Location-based sparse attention cannot leverage more ﬂexible content-based interactions among
arbitrary positions, as a limitation."
RELATED WORK,0.03303303303303303,"Content-based sparse attention allows more ﬂexible sparse patterns than location-based ones.
Malaviya et al. (2018) used sparsemax to obtain a sparse attention matrix, while (Correia et al.,
2019) used entmax. These methods require to compute the full attention matrix before sparsiﬁcation
and hence cannot reduce the quadratic computation complexity. Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) methods address this limitation by calculating the content-based sparse patterns in advance
(Roy et al., 2021; Kitaev et al., 2020; Daras et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a) (which will be discussed
more in Section 3.1). Those methods usually apply an ANN module as the shared hash function
to both queries and keys. Vyas et al. (2020) and Zhou et al. (2020) sparsiﬁed the attention maps
by eliminating redundant queries. Tay et al. (2020b) designed a differentiable sorting algorithm of
internal representations to enable efﬁcient quasi-global local attention. Contemporary to our work,
SparseFinder (Treviso et al., 2021) learns sparse attention patterns that approximate entmax attention,
but its bucketing strategies are still based on ANN approaches. In contrast, LHA directly predicts a
bucketing strategy (i.e., learnable hash functions) that maximizes the attention utility."
RELATED WORK,0.036036036036036036,"Another line of research explored low-rank or kernelized dense approximation of attention matrices,
instead of computing the attention scores exactly for only a few pairs. Wang et al. (2020b) applied
a low-rank decomposition to the attention matrix. Xiong et al. (2021) approximated the attention
matrix with Nyström approximation. Katharopoulos et al. (2020) utilized the association property
of Key-Query-Value multiplication and reduce the quadratic complexity to linear complexity with
kernelized approximation to the softmax operation. Choromanski et al. (2020) and Peng et al. (2021)
further proposed an unbiased approximation of softmax with random Fourier features."
RELATED WORK,0.03903903903903904,"Our work in this paper is directly related to the second category, i.e., content-based attention
sparsiﬁcation. Specially, we address the limitations of existing ANN-based methods by modeling
queries and keys in separate vector spaces and by proposing a novel approach to learn the hash

BUCKET IMBALANCE ISSUES,0.0990990990990991,"Previous content-based sparse attention models take it for granted that the ANN-derived sparse pattern
can effectively approximate the full attention. However, it is only veriﬁed via empirical evaluation on
the down-stream tasks yet, which cannot reﬂect the true attention map approximation ability. Notice
that there are two necessary conditions for sparse attention to work effectively and efﬁciently:"

We apply LSH to 10 attention heads in the 3rd layer of a Transformer3 pre-trained on language
modeling and obtain the results shown in Figure 1 (up). We can see that the imbalance issue not only
exists in the query-key ratios, but also in the bucket sizes. To go a step further, we apply LSH to all
16 × 10 = 160 attention heads in the pre-trained Transformer and ﬁnd that around 61.3% buckets

metric in ANN methods does not monotonically decrease with the dot-product metric used in attention

restricts the effectiveness of ANN methods. To investigate the root cause, we apply the SMYRF
asymmetric transformation (Equation 3) to queries and keys, which creates a monotonic relation
between Euclidean distances and dot-products. The new analysis results are shown in Figure 1 (down).
We can see that the asymmetric transformation would only exacerbate the imbalance problem, with
respect to both query-key ratios and bucket sizes. Therefore, we can conclude that the root cause of

present a box-plot of averaged attention utilities for all 16 Transformer layer in Figure 2. We can see
that the LSH methods obtain signiﬁcantly less attention utilities than the upper bound or L2H. As a
conclusion, the ANN-derived sparse patterns are arguably sub-optimal when used as hash functions
for sparse attention. We believe this also partially explains why most of these approaches need to
impose extra constraints (e.g. queries and keys are tied or normalized). In the next section, we

A sequence length of 1536 is used in both training and evaluation stages for our models. In ablation
study, we vary 1) the type of non-local attention heads, 2) the type of learnable hash function
in LHA (i.e., linear or two-layer MLP), 3) the number of non-local attention heads, and 4) the
number of non-local attention layers. We also consider a baseline where the hash functions generate

performance by 0.3 and 1.0, respectively. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that local Transformer is a very strong
baseline for language modeling that outperforms a pure LHA Transformer. We can also see that a
two-layer MLP works better than a linear function as the learnable hash functions in LHA. The best
performance is achieved when we set half of the heads to local attention and the other half to non-local
LHA for each layer. Finally, we can see that LHA consistently underperforms the untrainable LSH
counterparts under four different settings. For the test set evaluation, we use the best setting from
the ablation study. We can see that the proposed LHA model outperforms Transformer-XL, which

KL divergence is the optimization objective of LHA, while negative entropy measures the diversity
of bucket-wise attention utility. The model we use is a pure LHA model with 16 layers and 10 LHA
heads, trained on WikiText-103 for 6000 steps. Each LHA head has 8 hash buckets. From the plots,
we can see that the values of negative entropy consistently increase during training for both queries
and keys, while the values of KL divergence ﬁrst increase (due to the increase of the diversity of
bucket-wise attention utility), and then decrease (due to learning-to-hash optimization)."

instead of using a token sorting strategy (Roy et al. 2021) to maintain the same bucket sizes. When
calculating the query-key ratios, we do not count the buckets which have no queries or keys."
