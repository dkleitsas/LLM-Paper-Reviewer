ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.003663003663003663,"A fundamental limitation of applying semi-supervised learning in real-world set-
tings is the assumption that unlabeled test data contains only classes previously
encountered in the labeled training data. However, this assumption rarely holds for
data in-the-wild, where instances belonging to novel classes may appear at testing
time. Here, we introduce a novel open-world semi-supervised learning setting
that formalizes the notion that novel classes may appear in the unlabeled test data.
In this novel setting, the goal is to solve the class distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data, where at the test time every input instance either needs
to be classiﬁed into one of the existing classes or a new unseen class needs to be
initialized. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose ORCA, an end-to-end
deep learning approach that introduces uncertainty adaptive margin mechanism to
circumvent the bias towards seen classes caused by learning discriminative features
for seen classes faster than for the novel classes. In this way, ORCA reduces the gap
between intra-class variance of seen with respect to novel classes. Experiments on
image classiﬁcation datasets and a single-cell annotation dataset demonstrate that
ORCA consistently outperforms alternative baselines, achieving 25% improvement
on seen and 96% improvement on novel classes of the ImageNet dataset."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01098901098901099,"With the advent of deep learning, remarkable breakthroughs have been achieved and current machine
learning systems excel on tasks with large quantities of labeled data (LeCun et al., 2015; Silver et al.,
2016; Esteva et al., 2017). Despite the strengths, the vast majority of models are designed for the
closed-world setting rooted in the assumption that training and test data come from the same set of
predeﬁned classes (Bendale & Boult, 2015; Boult et al., 2019). This assumption, however, rarely
holds for data in-the-wild, as labeling data depends on having the complete knowledge of a given
domain. For example, biologists may prelabel known cell types (seen classes), and then want to
apply the model to a new tissue to identify known cell types but also to discover novel previously
unknown cell types (unseen classes). Similarly, in social networks one may want to classify users
into predeﬁned interest groups while also discovering new unknown/unlabeled interests of users.
Thus, in contrast to the commonly assumed closed world, many real-world problems are inherently
open-world — new classes can emerge in the test data that have never been seen (and labeled) during
training."
INTRODUCTION,0.014652014652014652,"Here we introduce open-world semi-supervised learning (open-world SSL) setting that generalizes
semi-supervised learning and novel class discovery. Under open-world SSL, we are given a labeled
training dataset as well as an unlabeled dataset. The labeled dataset contains instances that belong to
a set of seen classes, while instances in the unlabeled/test dataset belong to both the seen classes as
well as to an unknown number of unseen classes (Figure 1). Under this setting, the model needs to
either classify instances into one of the previously seen classes, or discover new classes and assign
instances to them. In other words, open-world SSL is a transductive learning setting under class
distribution mismatch in which unlabeled test set may contain classes that have never been labeled
during training, i.e., are not part of the labeled training set."

one of the classes previously seen in the labeled set, or form a novel class and assign instances to it."
INTRODUCTION,0.054945054945054944,"et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020b; Guo et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020) assumes class distribution mismatch
between labeled and unlabeled data, but in this setting the model only needs to be able to recognize
(reject) instances belonging to novel classes in the unlabeled data as out-of-distribution instances. In
contrast, instead of rejecting instances belonging to novel classes, open-world SSL aims at discovering
individual novel classes and then assigning instances to them. Novel class discovery (Hsu et al.,
2018; 2019; Han et al., 2019; 2020; Zhong et al., 2021) is a clustering problem where one assumes
unlabeled data is composed only of novel classes. In contrast, open-world SSL is more general as
instances in the unlabeled data can come from seen as well as from novel classes. To apply robust
SSL and novel class discovery methods to open-world SSL, one could in principle adopt a multi-step
approach by ﬁrst using robust SSL to reject instances from novel classes and then applying a novel
class discovery method on rejected instances to discover novel classes. An alternative would be that
one could treat all classes as “novel”, apply novel class discovery methods and then match some of
the classes back to the seen classes in the labeled dataset. However, our experiments show that such
ad hoc approaches do not perform well in practice. Therefore, it is necessary to design a method that
can solve this practical problem in an end-to-end framework."
INTRODUCTION,0.05860805860805861,"In this paper we propose ORCA (Open-woRld with unCertainty based Adaptive margin) that operates
under the novel open-world SSL setting. ORCA effectively assigns examples from the unlabeled data
to either previously seen classes, or forms novel classes by grouping similar instances. ORCA is an
end-to-end deep learning framework, where the key to our approach is a novel uncertainty adaptive
margin mechanism that gradually decreases plasticity and increases discriminability of the model
during training. This mechanism effectively reduces an undesired gap between intra-class variance of
seen with respect to the novel classes caused by learning seen classes faster than the novel, which
we show is a critical difﬁculty in this setting. We then develop a special model training procedure
that learns to classify data points into a set of previously seen classes while also learning to use an
additional classiﬁcation head for each newly discovered class. Classiﬁcation heads for seen classes
are used to assign the unlabeled examples to classes from the labeled set, while activating additional
classiﬁcation heads allows ORCA to form a novel class. ORCA does not need to know the number of
novel classes ahead of time and can automatically discover them at the deployment time."
INTRODUCTION,0.06227106227106227,"We evaluate ORCA on three benchmark image classiﬁcation datasets adapted for open-world SSL set-
ting and a single-cell annotation dataset from biology domain. Since no existing methods can operate
under the open-world SSL setting we extend existing state-of-the-art SSL, open-set recognition and
novel class discovery methods to the open-world SSL and compare them to ORCA. Experimental
results demonstrate that ORCA effectively addresses the challenges of open-world SSL setting and
consistently outperforms all baselines by a large margin. Speciﬁcally, ORCA achieves 25% and
96% improvements on seen and novel classes of the ImageNet dataset. Moreover, we show that
ORCA is robust to unknown number of novel classes, different distributions of seen and novel classes,
unbalanced data distributions, pretraining strategies and a small number of labeled examples."

Zhong et al., 2021), the task is to cluster unlabeled dataset consisting of similar, but completely
disjoint, classes than those present in the labeled dataset which is utilized to learn better representation
for clustering. These methods assume that at the test time all the classes are novel. While these
methods are able to discover novel classes, they do not recognize the seen/known classes. On the
contrary, our open-world SSL is more general because unlabeled test set consists of novel classes
but also classes previously seen in the labeled data that need to be identiﬁed. In principle, one could
extend novel class discovery methods by treating all classes as “novel” at test time and then matching

2020) relax the SSL assumption by assuming that instances from novel classes may appear in the
unlabeled test set. The goal in robust SSL is to reject instances from novel classes which are treated as
out-of-distribution instances. Instead of rejecting instances from novel classes, in open-world SSL the
goal is to discover individual novel classes and then assign instances to them. To extend robust SSL
to open-world SSL, one could apply clustering/novel class discovery methods to discarded instances.
Early work (Miller & Browning, 2003) considered solving the problem in such a way using extension
of the EM algorithm. However, our experiments show that by discarding the instances the embedding
learned by these methods does not allow for accurate discovery of novel classes."

which novel classes can appear during testing, and the model needs to reject instances from novel
classes. To extend these methods to open-world setting, we include a baseline that discovers classes
on rejected instances. However, results show that such approaches can not effectively address the
challenges of open-world SSL. Similarly, open-world recognition approaches (Bendale & Boult,
2015; Rudd et al., 2017; Boult et al., 2019) require the system to incrementally learn and extend
the set of known classes with novel classes. These methods incrementally label novel classes by

the test time. However, GZSL imposes additional assumption about availability of prior knowledge
given as auxiliary attributes that uniquely describe each individual class including the novel classes.
This restrictive assumption severely limits the application of GZSL methods in practice. In contrast,
open-world SSL is more general as it does not assume any prior information about classes."

OVERVIEW OF ORCA,0.1794871794871795,"The key challenge to solve open-world SSL is to learn both from seen/labeled as well as un-
seen/unlabeled classes. This is challenging as models learn discriminative representations faster on
the seen classes compared to the novel classes. This leads to smaller intra-class variance of seen
classes compared to novel classes. To circumvent this problem, we propose ORCA, an approach
that reduces the gap between intra-class variance of seen and novel classes during training using
the uncertainty adaptive margin. The key insight in ORCA is to control intra-class variance of seen
classes using uncertainty on unlabeled data: if uncertainty on unlabeled data is high we will enforce
larger intra-class variance of seen classes to reduce the gap between variance of seen and novel
classes, while if uncertainty is low we will enforce smaller intra-class variance on seen classes to
encourage the model to fully exploit labeled data. In this way, using the uncertainty adaptive margin
we control the intra-class variance of seen classes and ensure that discriminative representations for
seen classes are not learned too fast compared to novel classes."

of previously seen classes and the expected number of novel classes. So, ﬁrst |Cl| heads classify
instances to one of the previously seen classes, while the remaining heads assign instances to novel
classes. The ﬁnal class/cluster prediction is calculated as ci = argmax(W T · zi) ∈R. If ci /∈Cl,
then xi belongs to novel classes. The number of novel classes |Cu| can be known and given as an
input to the algorithm which is a typical assumption of clustering and novel class discovery methods.

SUPERVISED OBJECTIVE WITH UNCERTAINTY ADAPTIVE MARGIN,0.22344322344322345,"However, using standard cross-entropy loss on labeled data creates an imbalance problem between
the seen and novel classes, i.e., the gradient is updated for seen classes Cs, but not for novel classes
Cn. This can result in learning a classiﬁer with larger magnitudes (Kang et al., 2019) for seen classes,
leading the whole model to be biased towards the seen classes. To overcome the issue, we introduce
an uncertainty adaptive margin mechanism and propose to normalize the logits as we describe next."
SUPERVISED OBJECTIVE WITH UNCERTAINTY ADAPTIVE MARGIN,0.2271062271062271,"A key challenge is that seen classes are learned faster due to the supervised objective, and consequently
they tend to have a smaller intra-class variance compared to the novel classes (Liu et al., 2020). The
pairwise objective generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by ranking distances in the feature
space, so the imbalance of intra-class variances among classes will result in error-prone pseudo-labels.
In other words, instances from novel classes will be assigned to seen classes. To mitigate this bias,
we propose to use an adaptive margin mechanism to reduce the gap between the intra-class variance
of the seen and novel classes. Intuitively, at the beginning of the training, we want to enforce a larger
negative margin to encourage a similarly large intra-class variance of the seen classes with respect
to the novel classes. Close to the end of training, when clusters have been formed for the novel
classes, we adjust the margin term to be nearly 0 so that labeled data can be fully exploited by the
model, i.e., the objective boils down to standard cross entropy deﬁned in Eq. (2). We propose to
capture intra-class variance using uncertainty. Thus, we adjust the margin using uncertainty estimate
which achieves desired behavior — in early training epochs uncertainty is large which leads to a large
margin, while as training proceeds the uncertainty becomes smaller which leads to a smaller margin."

detrimental to cluster learning. Unlike (Hsu et al., 2018; Han et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2017) we
consider only positive pairs as we ﬁnd that including negative pairs in our objective does not beneﬁt
learning (negative pairs can be easily recognized). Our pairwise objective with only positive pairs is
related to (Van Gansbeke et al., 2020). However, we update distances and positive pairs in an online
fashion and thus beneﬁt from improved feature representation during training."

During training, we freeze the ﬁrst layers of the backbone fθ and update its last layers and classiﬁer
W. We adopt the same SimCLR pretraining protocol for all baselines. We also consider a setting

classiﬁcation datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky, 2009) and ImageNet (Russakovsky
et al., 2015), and a highly unbalanced single-cell Mouse Ageing Cell Atlas dataset from biology
domain (Consortium et al., 2020). For single-cell dataset, we consider a realistic cross-tissue cell
type annotation task where unlabeled data comes from different tissues compared to labeled data
(Cao et al., 2020a) (details in Appendix B). For the ImageNet dataset, we sub-sample 100 classes
following (Van Gansbeke et al., 2020). On all datasets, we use controllable ratios of unlabeled data
and novel classes. We ﬁrst divide classes into 50% seen and 50% novel classes. We then select 50%
of seen classes as the labeled dataset, and the rest as unlabeled set. We show results with different
ratio of seen and novel classes and with 10% labeled samples in the Appendix C."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.34798534798534797,"Baselines. Given that the open-world SSL is a new setting no ready-to-use baselines exist. We thus
extend novel class discovery, SSL and open-set recognition methods to the open-world SSL setting.
Novel class discovery methods can not recognize seen classes, i.e., match classes in unlabeled dataset
to previously seen classes from the labeled dataset. We report their performance on novel classes,
and extend these methods to be applicable to seen classes in the following way: We consider seen
classes as novel (these methods effectively cluster the unlabeled data) and report performance on
seen classes by using Hungarian algorithm to match some of the discovered classes with classes in
the labeled data. We consider two methods: DTC (Han et al., 2019) and RankStats (Han et al., 2020)."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.3516483516483517,"On the other hand, traditional SSL and open-set recognition (OSR) methods can not discover novel
classes. Thus we extend SSL and OSR methods to be applicable to novel classes in the following
way: We use SSL/OSR to classify points into known classes and estimate out-of-distribution (OOD)
samples. We report their performance on seen classes, and we then apply K-means clustering (Lloyd,
1982) to OOD samples to obtain clusters (novel classes). In this way we adapt two SSL methods to
the open-world SSL setting: Deep Safe SSL (DS3L) (Guo et al., 2020) and FixMatch (Sohn et al.,
2020), and recent deep learning OSR method CGDL (Sun et al., 2020a). CGDL automatically rejects
OOD samples. DS3L considers novel classes in the unlabeled data by assigning low weights to OOD
samples. To extend the method, we cluster samples with the lowest weights. For FixMatch, we
estimate OOD samples based on softmax conﬁdence scores. For both SSL methods, we use ground
truth information of seen and novel classes partitions to determine the threshold for OOD samples."
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,0.3553113553113553,"On image datasets, we pretrain all novel class discovery and SSL baselines with SimCLR to ensure
that the beneﬁts of ORCA are not due to pretraining. The only exception is DTC which has its
own specialized pretraining procedure on the labeled data (Han et al., 2019). As an additional
baseline, we ran K-means clustering on representation obtained after SimCLR pretraining (Chen
et al., 2020a). We also perform an extensive ablation studies to evaluate beneﬁts of ORCA’s approach.
Speciﬁcally, we include comparison to a baseline in which adaptive margin cross-entropy loss in
supervised objective is replaced with the standard cross-entropy loss, i.e., zero margin (ZM) approach.
Additionally, to evaluate effect of the adaptive margin we compare ORCA to a ﬁxed negative margin
(FNM). We ﬁnd that margin value of 0.5 achieves best performance (Appendix C) and we use
that value in our experiments. We name the ﬁrst baseline ORCA-ZM, and the second baseline
ORCA-FNM. Additional implementation and experimental details can be found in Appendices."

RESULTS,0.38461538461538464,"Evaluation on benchmark datasets. We report accuracy on seen and novel classes, as well as
overall accuracy. Results in Table 2 show that ORCA consistently outperforms all baselines by a large
margin. For example, on seen classes of the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets ORCA achieves 21%
and 25% improvements over the best baseline, respectively. On novel classes, ORCA outperforms
baselines by 51% on the CIFAR-100, 96% on the ImageNet and 104% on the single-cell dataset.
Furthermore, comparison of ORCA to ORCA-ZM and ORCA-FNM baselines clearly demonstrates
the importance of introducing uncertainty adaptive margin for solving open-world SSL. Overall, our
results demonstrate that (i) open-world SSL setting is hard and existing methods can not solve it
adequately, and (ii) ORCA effectively addresses the challenges of the open-world SSL and achieves
remarkable performance gains."
RESULTS,0.3882783882783883,"Beneﬁts of uncertainty adaptive margin. We further systematically evaluate the effect of intro-
ducing uncertainty adaptive margin mechanism. On the CIFAR-100 dataset, we compare ORCA to
ORCA-ZM and ORCA-FNM baselines during training (Figure 3). We report accuracy and uncertainty
which captures intra-class variance, as deﬁned in Eq. (4). At epoch 140, we decay the learning rate.
Results show that ORCA-ZM is not able to reduce intra-class variance on novel classes during train-
ing, resulting in unsatisfactory performance on novel classes. On seen classes, ORCA-ZM reaches
high performance very quickly, but its accuracy starts to decrease close to the end of training. The
reason why learning rate triggers performance drop is that small learning rate can lead to overﬁtting
issues (Li et al., 2019) which presents a problem in ORCA-ZM due to the difference in variances
between seen and novel classes and noisy pseudolabels that deteriorate with small learning rate (Song
et al., 2020). This shows that without uncertainty adaptive margin the model learns seen classes very
quickly, but fails to achieve satisfying performance on novel classes. In contrast, ORCA effectively
reduces intra-class variance on both seen and novel classes and consistently improves accuracy. This
result is in perfect accordance with our key idea of slowly increasing discriminability of seen classes
during training to ensure similar intra-class variance between seen and novel classes. Compared
to ORCA-FNM, adaptive margin shows clear beneﬁts on seen classes, achieving lower intra-class
variance and better performance during the whole training process. In summary, negative margin
ensures larger intra-class variance of seen classes allowing the model to learn to form novel classes,
while adaptive margin ensures that the model can fully exploit labeled data as training proceeds."
RESULTS,0.39194139194139194,"Compared to other baselines in Table 2, ORCA outperforms their ﬁnal performance after only 12
epochs. Additionally, in Appendix C we show that uncertainty adaptive margin improves the quality
of pseudo-labels and demonstrate robustness to the uncertainty strength parameter λ. Taken together,
our results strongly support the importance of the uncertainty adaptive margin."

RESULTS,0.43956043956043955,"Evaluation with the unknown number of novel classes. ORCA and other baselines assume that
number of novel classes is known. However, in practice we often do not know number of classes in
advance. In such case, we can apply ORCA by ﬁrst estimating the number of classes. To evaluate
performance on the CIFAR-100 dataset which has 100 classes, we ﬁrst estimate the number of
clusters using technique proposed in (Han et al., 2019) to be 124. We then use the estimated number
of classes to re-test all the algorithms. ORCA automatically prunes number of classes by not utilizing
all initialized classiﬁcation heads, and ﬁnds 114 novel clusters. Results in Table 3 show that ORCA
outperforms novel class discovery baselines, achieving 97% improvement over RankStats. Moreover,
with the estimated number of classes ORCA achieves only slightly worse results compared to the
setting in which the number of classes is known a priori. We further analyzed the 14 additional heads
used in ORCA unassigned with Hungarian algorithm and found that they are related to small clusters,
i.e., the average number of samples in the unassigned heads is only 16. The NMI on these classes
is 59.4, which is slightly higher than the NMI on the assigned heads. This indicates that additional
clusters contain smaller subclasses of the correct class and belong to meaningful clusters. We perform
additional ablation study with large number of classes in Appendix C."
RESULTS,0.4432234432234432,"Ablation study on the objective function. The objective function in ORCA consists of supervised
objective with uncertainty adaptive margin, pairwise objective, and regularization term. To investigate
importance of each part, we conduct an ablation study in which we modify ORCA by removing: (i)
supervised objective (i.e., w/o LS), and (ii) regularization term (i.e., w/o R). In the ﬁrst case, we
rely only on the regularized pairwise objective to solve the problem, while in the latter case we use
unregularized supervised and pairwise objectives. We note that the pairwise objective is required to
be able to discover novel classes. The results shown in Table 4 on the CIFAR-100 dataset demonstrate
that both supervised objective LS and regularization R are essential parts of the objective function.

and the model needs to assign instances either to classes seen in the labeled data, or form novel classes
and assign instances to them. To address the problem, we proposed ORCA, a method based on the
uncertainty adaptive margin mechanism which controls intra-class variance of seen and novel classes
during training. Our extensive experiments show that ORCA effectively solves open-world SSL and
outperforms alternative baselines by a large margin. Our work advocates for a shift from traditional
closed-world setting to the more realistic open-world evaluation of machine learning models."

REFERENCES,0.7728937728937729,"Implementation details for baselines. We compare ORCA to methods from three settings: (i)
novel class discovery methods, (ii) semi-supervised methods, (iii) open-set recognition methods.
First, novel class discovery methods have the ability to discover novel classes but lack the ability
to recognize seen classes. Therefore, we apply them to discover novel classes and then evaluate
performance by matching discovered classes/clusters to ground truth labels by solving optimal
assignment using Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955). Notice that we are giving an advantage to
these methods compared to ORCA since we are using ground truth information for matching classes
and these method have never identiﬁed seen classes. Second, to extend semi-supervised methods
we ﬁrst estimate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples that should belong to novel classes and then
cluster OOD samples to assign OOD samples to different classes. For FixMatch which is a standard
semi-supervised method, we ﬁrst need to estimate OOD samples. We use the conﬁdence scores
from the softmax to estimate OOD samples, i.e., lower conﬁdence means lower probability that the
example belongs to the seen class. On the other hand, DS3L already assumes that OOD samples are
present in the data and assigns low weights to these examples so we can directly use the weights to
estimate examples from novel classes. However, in both cases we need to determine a threshold for
what is considered to be an OOD example. To determine a threshold, we use ground truth information,
i.e., the ratio of samples belonging to seen and novel classes. We set the threshold so that the ratio of
seen and unseen in the prediction aligns with the ground truth split (50% in our experiments). After
thresholding OOD examples, we can simply cluster them by running K-means clustering. Finally,
open-set recognition methods automatically reject OOD samples and we cluster OOD samples like in
semi-supevised methods."

uncertainty adaptive margin is that it reduces the bias towards seen classes. To evaluate the effect of
uncertainty adaptive margin on the quality of generated pseudo-labels during training, we compare
the accuracy of adaptive margin to baseline approach with zero margin (ZM) and ﬁxed negative
margin (FNM) approach on the CIFAR-100 dataset. We report accuracy of generated pseudo-labels in
Figure 5, following the same setting as in Figure 3. This analysis additionally conﬁrms that adaptive
margin signiﬁcantly increases the accuracy of the estimated pseudo-labels."

CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets long-tailed by following an exponential decay in sample sizes
across different classes. The imbalance ratio between sample sizes of the most frequent and least
frequent class is set to 10 in the experiments. We ﬁnd that the proposed regularization consistently
improves performance over non-regularized model even with unbalanced distribution."
