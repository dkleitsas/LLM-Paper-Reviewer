ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0036900369003690036,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved significant successes, which aims to obtain
a single policy maximizing the expected cumulative rewards for a given task. However,
in many real-world scenarios, e.g., navigating in complex environments and controlling
robots, one may need to find a set of policies having both high rewards and diverse behav-
iors, which can bring better exploration and robust few-shot adaptation. Recently, some
methods have been developed by using evolutionary techniques, including iterative repro-
duction and selection of policies. However, due to the inefficient selection mechanisms,
these methods cannot fully guarantee both high quality and diversity. In this paper, we
propose EDO-CS, a new Evolutionary Diversity Optimization algorithm with Clustering-
based Selection. In each iteration, the policies are divided into several clusters based on
their behaviors, and a high-quality policy is selected from each cluster for reproduction.
EDO-CS also adaptively balances the importance between quality and diversity in the
reproduction process. Experiments on various (i.e., deceptive and multi-modal) continu-
ous control tasks, show the superior performance of EDO-CS over previous methods, i.e.,
EDO-CS can achieve a set of policies with both high quality and diversity efficiently while
previous methods cannot."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01107011070110701,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an effective method for training agents to make decisions in a given envi-
ronment, which is often to obtain a policy maximizing the expected cumulative rewards (Li, 2017; Sutton
& Barto, 2018). As RL is applied to more real-world scenarios, training a single policy is insufficient to
handle complex problems, and we may need to find a set of policies with both high quality (i.e., rewards)
and diverse behaviors. For example, when navigating in complex environments (Zhu et al., 2017; Mirowski
et al., 2017), there are usually deceptive rewards trapping a single policy into the local optima. Maintaining
a set of policies allows data to be collected with diverse behaviors and may lead to better exploration in
these environments. When controlling robots, it is fragile to have one single policy (Cully et al., 2015). In
contrast, maintaining a set of policies can improve robustness, e.g., enable real robots to recover quickly
from joint damage (Cully et al., 2015), and also be helpful for few-shot adaption when facing unseen tasks
(Kumar et al., 2020). General deep RL algorithms mostly focus on achieving high rewards, restricting their
ability to generate diverse behaviors."

INTRODUCTION,0.02214022140221402,"Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are general-purpose heuristic optimization algorithms that maintain a pop-
ulation (i.e., a set of solutions), and simulate the natural evolution process with iterative reproduction and
selection (B¨ack, 1996). Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms (Pugh et al., 2016; Cully & Demiris, 2018) are a
specific type of EAs that aim to return a set of high-quality solutions with diverse behaviors in a single run.
They have been naturally applied to RL in complex environments, generating the corresponding RL algo-
rithms NSR-ES (Conti et al., 2018), ME-ES (Colas et al., 2020), DvD-ES (Parker-Holder et al., 2020) and
QD-RL (Cideron et al., 2020). Note that classical QD algorithms like NSLC (Lehman & Stanley, 2011a) or
MAP-Elites (Mouret & Clune, 2015; Cully et al., 2015) often employ a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the un-
derlying optimizer. However, as RL tasks are often high-dimensional, these methods have replaced GA with
Evolution Strategies (ES) presented by Salimans et al. (2017), which has achieved performance comparable
to state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms on high-dimensional control tasks."
INTRODUCTION,0.025830258302583026,"NSR-ES (Conti et al., 2018) maintains a population of ES agents and introduces Novelty Search (NS)
(Lehman & Stanley, 2011b) to improve the performance on RL tasks with sparse or deceptive rewards. That
is, it adds a novelty term (representing behavior diversity) to the objective function of ES agents. In each
iteration, NSR-ES selects a policy from the population for reproduction, where the probability of selecting
a particular policy is proportional to its novelty score."
INTRODUCTION,0.02952029520295203,"In contrast to NSR-ES (Conti et al., 2018), DvD-ES (Parker-Holder et al., 2020) optimizes all policies of a
population simultaneously, by maximizing the sum of their rewards and a population-wide diversity criterion
(i.e., the volume between the behaviors of the policies). Though DvD-ES can maintain a diverse population,
it ignores the previously generated policies, leading to “cycling” (i.e., a phenomenon where the population
keeps moving alternatively between two areas) and thus inefficient performance."
INTRODUCTION,0.033210332103321034,"It has been shown (Cully & Demiris, 2018) that keeping an additional archive (i.e., a subset of policies
generated-so-far) and selecting policies from the archive instead of the population for reproduction can be
beneficial. There are different ways to select policies from the archive. ME-ES (Colas et al., 2020) uses
an alternating selection mechanism, which selects several policies with the best quality in one iteration and
with the best diversity in the next iteration. QD-RL (Cideron et al., 2020) uses Pareto-based selection (Deb
et al., 2002) by considering both quality and diversity in one iteration, and achieves better performance. That
is, the Pareto front is first calculated with respect to quality and diversity, and then the policies are selected
from the Pareto front based on the crowding distance."
INTRODUCTION,0.03690036900369004,"Although Pareto-based selection can guarantee the selected policies uniformly distributed over the Pareto
front, these policies may be still similar in the behavior space, limiting the performance of QD-RL. For
example, Figure 1(a) shows the heat map of a synthetic function f(x, y) in the behavior space, where the
color corresponds to the function value, which we call quality here. The goal is to find the four optimal
solutions distributed in the center of four regions of the behavior space. The points represent the solutions in
the current archive, from which we need to select some solutions for reproduction. QD-RL first calculates
the diversity of each solution (i.e., the average Euclidean distance between this solution and its k-nearest
neighbors) in the archive, and then gets the Pareto front with respect to quality and diversity, as shown in
Figure 1(b). By Pareto-based selection, the blue points together with the red star will be selected, which are
uniformly distributed over the Pareto front, but concentrated in the lower right corner of the behavior space."
INTRODUCTION,0.04059040590405904,"In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Diversity Optimization algorithm with Clustering-based Selection
(EDO-CS). In each iteration, the policies in the archive are divided into several clusters based on their
behaviors, and a high-quality policy is selected from each cluster for reproduction. This selection mechanism
can naturally guarantee the diversity of the selected policies in the behavior space. For example, the red
points and red star in Figure 1(a) will be selected by clustering-based selection, which are distributed in the
four different areas of the behavioral space."

high rewards and diverse behaviors (Pugh et al., 2016; Cully & Demiris, 2018). The behavior characteriza-

location (x, y) of the robot in the robot locomotion problem, and the corresponding behavior space is R2. It
can also be defined as the actions taken by policies, leading to a high-dimensional behavior space. Given an

OVERVIEW"
OVERVIEW,0.11439114391143912,"A general flow of EDO-CS is shown in Algorithm 1. It first initializes an archive A with a maximum capacity
of l, which contains the policies generated-so-far together with their corresponding cumulative rewards and
behaviors; and a bandit B, which is used to sample the weight of diversity (i.e., λ in Eq. (2)) during the
reproduction process. Then, it adds l randomly generated policies into the archive A (lines 1–5), and tries
to improve the policies in A iteratively (lines 7–20). In each iteration, EDO-CS employs K-means (Lloyd,
1982) to partition the policies in the archive into K clusters based on their behaviors (line 8), and selects
one specific policy from each cluster (line 9). After getting K policies, EDO-CS samples the value of λ in
the objective function for each policy from the bandit B, and uses the ES optimizer to update the selected
policies in parallel for T ′ iterations (lines 11–15). The archive and bandit are updated in line 18 after
evaluating all the generated offspring policies. To maintain the diversity of the archive, we avoid adding
policies with similar behaviors (Cully & Mouret, 2013). To be specific, whenever we want to add a new
policy into the archive, we first select the policy with the most similar behavior from the archive. If their
behavior distance is greater than a threshold, we add the new policy into the archive. Otherwise, we compare
their rewards and keep the policy with a higher reward. Note that if the archive size exceeds the capacity l
after adding a new policy, the oldest policy in the archive will be deleted. EDO-CS repeats the above process
until the number of iterations reaches T."

policies in each iteration, and thus one unit in the x-axis just corresponds to their one iteration. We report
the mean and standard deviations across six identical seeds (2016 - 2021) for all algorithms and all tasks."

DECEPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS,0.33579335793357934,"First, we consider an environment with deceptive rewards, which is modified from the standard Ant-v2
environment. As shown in Figure 2(a), a U-shape wall is in front of the ant, separating the ant from the
target, i.e., green cuboid. The reward is a mixture of distance away from the target and costs for joint
torques, encouraging the ant to walk to the target as fast as possible. Obviously, following the gradient of
only the expected cumulative rewards will make the ant walk forward directly and get trapped by the wall.
Here we use the final location (x, y) of the ant as the behavior characterization."
DECEPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS,0.33948339483394835,"Figure 2(b) shows the rewards of the best-performing policy in the current archive in each iteration. As
expected, both Vanilla ES and DvD-ES fail to get past the wall, because they do not use an archive to record
previously explored policies, and thus cannot ensure diversity, leading to bad exploration under deceptive
environments. NSR-ES can converge fast, but will finally get trapped into a local optimum. This is because
NSR-ES reproduces only one policy in each iteration, and may update the same policy for several iterations,
which can cause a rapid improvement of a particular policy but may also lead to a sub-optimal policy due
to the lack of considering the whole behavior space. Among the previous algorithms we have compared,
only QD-RL can finally obtain the optimal policy, but its convergence speed is slow. We can observe that
our proposed algorithm EDO-CS can converge to the optimal policy much faster, showing the advantage of
clustering-based selection."

high-quality policies with diverse behaviors. The created HalfCheetahFwdBwd and AntFwdBwd environ-

instead of rewarding the agent for walking forward only, we assign rewards for both walking forward and
backward, implying that there are two modals in this environment, i.e., walking forward and walking back-
ward. We train policies in this multi-modal environment, but test them in the single-modal environments
HalfCheetahFwd and HalfCheetahBwd. The best-performing policies for these two modals are reported,

Table 2 reports the cumulative rewards, together with the average performance rankings of all algorithms in
the four environments. We can observe that Vanilla ES which maintains one policy can only learn a single
modal, i.e., walking backward in HalfCheetahFwdBwd and walking forward in AntFwdBwd. As expected,
all the other algorithms maintain a population of policies, and thus can achieve better performance than
Vanilla ES in the multi-modal environments. DvD-ES can learn both modals in AntFwdBwd, but a single
modal in HalfCheetahFwdBwd. NSR-ES, ME-ES, CVT-ES and QD-RL can learn both modals in both
environments, but the quality of each modal is less satisfactory due to their inefficient selection mechanisms.

SINGLE-MODAL ENVIRONMENTS,0.3948339483394834,"To examine the performance of EDO-CS for solving tasks that do not require much diversity, we conduct
experiments in standard MuJoCo environments. Here we adopt the action-based behavior characterization,
which was also used in (Parker-Holder et al., 2020). The behavior characterization b(πθ) of a particular
deterministic policy πθ is represented in a vectorized form: b(πθ) = {πθ(·|s)}s∈S, where S is the state
space, and πθ(· | s) corresponds to the action taken in state s under policy πθ. Since the state space can be
infinitely large, we randomly sample 20 states instead of all. We compare all algorithms used before, except
ME-ES, which requires discretization of the behavior space and is hard to be applied to high dimensional
behavior space. Figure 3 shows the results of different algorithms on four standard MuJoCo tasks. We can
observe that EDO-CS can always achieve the best final performance. Although Vanilla ES and NSR-ES can
sometimes converge faster at the early stage of optimization, e.g., in the Humanoid-v2 environment, their
final performance is limited. The performance of DVD-ES and QD-RL is dominated by that of EDO-CS,
because their curves are always below that of EDO-CS."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.45387453874538747,"QD algorithms aim to help RL to find a set of high-quality policies with diverse behaviors in complex envi-
ronments. However, existing algorithms cannot fully guarantee both quality and diversity, mainly because
of their inefficient selection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose the algorithm EDO-CS using clustering-
based selection, and demonstrate its superiority by experiments on various control tasks."
CONCLUSION,0.4575645756457565,"We have used ES as the optimizer. In fact, EDO-CS can also be equipped with the sample-efficient policy
optimizer (Liu et al., 2020; Nilsson & Cully, 2021), which may further improve the performance. The
mechanism of self-adjusting λ by multi-armed bandit modeling can be replaced by state-of-the-art online-
learning algorithms, which may better balance the importance of quality and diversity. In addition, how
to decide the population size automatically is also a matter of interest. One possible approach is to let
the clustering algorithm determine the number of clusters by itself. Other interesting future works include
combining EDO-CS with representation or manifold learning (Vassiliades & Mouret, 2018; Gaier et al.,
2020; Rakicevic et al., 2021) in the parameter space or behavior space, and analyzing the performance of
EDO-CS theoretically (Gao et al., 2015; Doncieux et al., 2019)."

quality (i.e., rewards) and an explicit diversity metric, which is, however, quite difficult. First, it is hard
to balance the weights of quality and diversity in the objective function. Second, this is actually a pseudo-
Boolean optimization problem with the search space size

, where l is the archive size and K is the number
of selected policies. Besides, this optimization problem requires an efficient optimization algorithm, which
is, however, not easy to design. Here, we empirically compare our clustering-based selection strategy with
the direct-optimization-based selection strategy."
REFERENCES,0.6752767527675276,"For the direct optimization procedure, a set of high-quality policies with diverse behaviors is selected from
the archive in each iteration, by directly optimizing the weighted sum of quality and diversity. The quality
is defined as the sum of rewards of the selected policies. We consider two diversity measures. One is the
sum of the pairwise distances between all the policies in the selected set. The other is the determinant of the
similarity matrix Π of the policies in the selected set, where Πi,j is the similarity between the i-th and j-th
selected policies, and the main diagonal are all 1. The similarity matrix Π is also used in DvD-ES (Parker-
Holder et al., 2020). The two corresponding objective functions are denoted as fpair and fdet, respectively,
as shown in Eqs. (8) and (9)."

An essential step of EDO-CS is to cluster policies in the behavior space. We
have adopted the K-means clustering algorithm because of its popularity. However, it is interesting to
examine whether the choice of clustering algorithm will affect the performance of EDO-CS largely. Thus, we
conduct experiments over various clustering algorithms, including Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering
(HAC) (Murtagh & Legendre, 2014), K-means (Lloyd, 1982), Balanced Iterative Reducing Clustering using
Hierarchies (BIRCH) (Zhang et al., 1996), and Spectral Clustering (Von Luxburg, 2007). Figure 5 shows that
these clustering algorithms except BIRCH can lead to the similar performance of EDO-CS in most cases.
BIRCH is suitable for a large number of samples, while the number of policies in the archive is relatively
small. Thus, we may not get good clustering results by BIRCH, degrading the performance."

We also study the influence of the number T ′ of updating iterations,

selecting it from the archive. We have tested T ′ ∈{5, 10, 15, 20} under various environments. The results
in Table 8 show that the performance of EDO-CS is not very sensitive to T ′. Note that we have also tried
to update the selected policy for only one iteration (i.e., set T ′ = 1), but it fails. If the number of updating
iterations is too small, the difference between solutions will be insignificant, leading to ineffective selection."
