Introduction
24"
INTRODUCTION,0.05555555555555555,"Deep learning successfully transits the feature engineering from manual to automatic design and
25"
INTRODUCTION,0.057777777777777775,"enables optimization of the mapping function from sample to feature. Consequently, the search
26"
INTRODUCTION,0.06,"for effective neural networks has gradually become an important and practical direction. However,
27"
INTRODUCTION,0.06222222222222222,"designing the architecture remains a challenging task. Certain research studies explore the impact
28"
INTRODUCTION,0.06444444444444444,"of depth [1,2,3] and the type of convolution [4,5] on performance. Moreover, some researchers
29"
INTRODUCTION,0.06666666666666667,"have attempted to simplify the architecture design. VGGNet [6] was directly stacked by a series
30"
INTRODUCTION,0.06888888888888889,"of convolution layers with plain topology. To better adapt the optimization process of gradient
31"
INTRODUCTION,0.07111111111111111,"descent process, GoogleNet [7] introduced parallel modules, while Highway networks [8] employed
32"
INTRODUCTION,0.07333333333333333,"gating units to regulate information flow, resulting in elastic topologies. Driven by the significance
33"
INTRODUCTION,0.07555555555555556,"of depth, the residual block consisted of residual mapping and shortcut was raised in ResNet [9].
34"
INTRODUCTION,0.07777777777777778,"Topological changes in neural networks successfully scaled up neural networks to hundreds of layers.
35"
INTRODUCTION,0.08,"The proposed residual connectivity was widely approved and was subsequently applied in other
36"
INTRODUCTION,0.08222222222222222,"works such as MobileNet [10,11] and ShuffleNet [12]. Divergent from the relative sparse topologies,
37"
INTRODUCTION,0.08444444444444445,"DenseNet [13] wired densely among blocks to fully leverage feature reuse. Recent advances in
38"
INTRODUCTION,0.08666666666666667,"computer vision [25,26] also explored neural architecture search (NAS) methods [14,15,16] to search
39"
INTRODUCTION,0.08888888888888889,"convolutional blocks. In recent years, Yuan proposed a topological perspective using directed acyclic

41"
INTRODUCTION,0.09333333333333334,"neural networks (ANNs). However, these approaches suffer from the bias of unidirectional and
42"
INTRODUCTION,0.09555555555555556,"acyclic structures, limiting the signal’s capability for free transmission in the network.
43"
INTRODUCTION,0.09777777777777778,"The existing efforts in neural network connectivity have primarily focused on the tree structures where
44"
INTRODUCTION,0.1,"neural units at the same level cannot exchange information with each other, resulting in significant
45"
INTRODUCTION,0.10222222222222223,"drawbacks for ANNs. This limitation arises due to the absence of a neural module concept. In this
46"
INTRODUCTION,0.10444444444444445,"paper, we argue that the current connectivity approaches fail to adequately capture the essence of
47"
INTRODUCTION,0.10666666666666667,"neural networks. Since the nodes at the same level of a tree cannot establish connections with each
48"
INTRODUCTION,0.10888888888888888,"other, it hampers the transfer of information between these neural units, leading to substantial defects
49"
INTRODUCTION,0.1111111111111111,"for ANNs. We argue that the nodes in the same level should form a neural module and establish
50"
INTRODUCTION,0.11333333333333333,"interconnections. As a result, we introduce a method to build up a bidirectional complete graph
51"
INTRODUCTION,0.11555555555555555,"for nodes at the same level of an ANN. By linking the nodes in a YOKE fashion, we create neural
52"

53"
INTRODUCTION,0.12,"construct a bidirectional complete graph in ANNs and yields remarkable improvements. We refer
54"
INTRODUCTION,0.12222222222222222,"to our model as Yoked Neural Network, YNN for brevity. It is important to note that if all the edge
55"
INTRODUCTION,0.12444444444444444,"weights in the bidirectional complete graph become vestigial and approach to zero, our YNN would
56"

57"
INTRODUCTION,0.1288888888888889,"In this paper, we analyze the structural bias of existing ANN structures. To more accurately mimic
58"
INTRODUCTION,0.13111111111111112,"neural networks, our method efficiently eliminates structural bias. In our model, nodes not only
59"

67"
INTRODUCTION,0.1511111111111111,"Finally, to optimize the structure of YNN, we further attach an auxiliary sparsity constraint that

Why YNN is Introduced?
125"
METHODOLOGY,0.28,"NN stands for a type of information flow. The traditional structure of ANN is a tree, which is a natural
126"
METHODOLOGY,0.2822222222222222,"way to describe this type of information flow. Then, we can represent the architecture as G = (N, E),
127"
METHODOLOGY,0.28444444444444444,"where N is the set of nodes and E denotes the set of edges. In this tree, each edge eij ∈E performs
128"
METHODOLOGY,0.2866666666666667,"a transformation operation parameterized by wij, where ij stands for the topological ordering from
129"
METHODOLOGY,0.28888888888888886,"the node ni to node nj with ni, nj ∈N. In fact, the importance of the connection is determined
130"
METHODOLOGY,0.2911111111111111,"by the weight of eij. The tree structure as a natural way to represent such formation flow is most
131"
METHODOLOGY,0.29333333333333333,"frequently used in ANN.
132"
METHODOLOGY,0.29555555555555557,"A tree is a hierarchical nested structure where a node can be influenced only by its precursor node,
133"
METHODOLOGY,0.29777777777777775,"thereby causing transformation of information between them. In a tree structure, the root node has no
134"
METHODOLOGY,0.3,"precursor node, while each other node has one and only one precursor node. The leaf node has no
135"
METHODOLOGY,0.3022222222222222,"subsequent nodes. The number of subsequent nodes of each other node can be one or multiple. In
136"
METHODOLOGY,0.30444444444444446,"addition, the tree structure in mathematical statistics can represent some hierarchical relationships. A
137"
METHODOLOGY,0.30666666666666664,"tree structure has many applications. It can also indicate subordinating relationships.
138"
METHODOLOGY,0.3088888888888889,"In recent years, some researchers attempted to generalize this structure. In those works, except the
139"
METHODOLOGY,0.3111111111111111,"root node, all other nodes are made to have multiple precursor nodes, i.e., the hierarchical information
140"
METHODOLOGY,0.31333333333333335,"flow is made to form a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
141"
METHODOLOGY,0.31555555555555553,"However, a tree or a DAG is a hierarchical nested structure where a node can be influenced only by
142"
METHODOLOGY,0.31777777777777777,"its precursor node, which makes the transformation of information quite inadequate. Moreover, we

144"
