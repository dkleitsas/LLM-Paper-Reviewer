ABSTRACT,0.011142061281337047,Abstract
ABSTRACT,0.013927576601671309,"Physical Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) plays a crucial role in numerous applica-
tions. However, existing HSI techniques are limited to specific object dynamics and
privileged information, which prevents the development of more comprehensive
applications. To address this limitation, we introduce HumanVLA for general
object rearrangement directed by practical vision and language. A teacher-student
framework is utilized to develop HumanVLA. A state-based teacher policy is
trained first using goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and adversarial mo-
tion prior. Then, it is distilled into a vision-language-action model via behavior
cloning. We propose several key insights to facilitate the large -scale learning pro-
cess. To support general object rearrangement by physical humanoid, we introduce
a novel Human-in-the-Room dataset encompassing various rearrangement tasks.
Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed approach."

INTRODUCTION,0.025069637883008356,"previous efforts have been made to promote expressive humanoid control [36, 46, 27, 56], static
physical scene interaction [43, 15, 50, 33], and manipulating a specific object [47, 15, 51]. These
works have achieved great success in synthesizing plausible HSI controls."
INTRODUCTION,0.027855153203342618,"Nonetheless, significant challenges persist in the realm of more extensive HSI applications and two
primary issues need to be solved. Firstly, the current techniques are limited to static objects, such as
sitting on a chair [50, 33], or specific object dynamics, such as carrying a box [15] and throwing a
ball [47]. However, in a more complicated real-world environment, humans demonstrate exceptional
skills in manipulating a diverse range of objects with different geometries, poses, and weights. It
poses a challenging requirement on the varied dynamics of objects in HSI synthesis, i.e., a universal
manipulation policy. Secondly, ground-truth object and goal states are necessary to direct humanoid
controls in previous works. However, without the help of external localization devices, this privileged
information is difficult to access in a real-world transfer. It prohibits practical real-world extensions
like humanoid robots and necessitates an easily deployable perception method."
INTRODUCTION,0.03064066852367688,"Our work takes a step forward in the above two challenges. We investigate the concept of general-
purpose object rearrangement performed by a physically interactive humanoid. The whole-body
physical humanoid is instructed to carry out daily object loco-manipulations in an indoor room
setting. The tasks involve human-like motion controls, interaction with diverse objects, and following
desired object dynamics. Moreover, considering the unavailability of privileged information about
object and goal states in real-world humanoid applications, we delve into humanoid controls directed
by practical vision and language. Compared to privileged states, vision-language modalities are
more accessible and offer new potential for practical applications. It also presents an ultimate vision
of the research community on humanoids: a human-like agent capable of understanding language
instructions, perceiving its environment, and executing daily tasks to assist humans. Fig. 1 provides
intuitive examples of our work, where the humanoid agent can push a table, carry a laptop, and pull
a chair, all directed by vision and language. Comparisons of our work with previous studies are
available in Tab. 1."
INTRODUCTION,0.033426183844011144,"Our work starts with learning state-based teacher policy and then distills the policy into a vision-
language-action model. In the first stage, we train the policy using goal-conditioned reinforcement
learning and adversarial motion priors (AMP) [36], within a generative adversarial imitation learn-
ing [16] paradigm. The discrimination reward plus task-conditioned reward encourages humanoids to
generate realistic motions and complete the task. However, interacting with diverse objects remains
challenging for vanilla AMP. We introduce improved techniques to facilitate general manipulation,
in-context navigation, and prioritized task completion. In the second stage, we distill the policy into
a student network, named HumanVLA, an end-to-end vision-language-action model for physical
humanoid. Behavior cloning [2] is used to train the student HumanVLA, i.e., cloning the teacher
action at each step. A challenge of learning VLA models is the poor perception quality of the
unconstrained camera pose. We propose a novel active rendering technique to improve gaze intention."
INTRODUCTION,0.036211699164345405,"To support HumanVLA, we create a novel dataset named Human-in-the-Room (HITR). It consists of
four different room layouts: bedroom, livingroom, kitchen, and warehouse. Each layout is populated
with separated, instantiable, and replaceable objects from HSSD [22] assets to create diverse scenes.
The humanoid agent is placed in the scene with an instruction to rearrange the room. Statistically, the
HITR dataset consists of 50 static objects and 34 movable objects. In our extensive experiments, we
train HumanVLA in IsaacGym [28] with tasks from HITR. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method in generalized object rearrangement and vision-language perception."
INTRODUCTION,0.03899721448467967,"In summary, our contributions include: (1) We study general object rearrangement by physical
humanoids. Several advanced techniques are introduced to interact with diverse objects. (2) We
propose HumanVLA, the first vision-language-action model on physical humanoids to complete
tasks directed by egocentric vision and natural language instruction. (3) We propose the HITR dataset
to facilitate research in this field. Comprehensive experiments are conducted in HITR to validate the
effectiveness of our method."

RELATED WORKS,0.0584958217270195,"methods aim at synthesizing visually plausible motions with less penetration, floating, and being
semantically faithful. It leverages generative neural networks like VAEs [14, 7], Transformers [1, 19],
or Diffusions [24, 18, 20] to predict next state. Our work belongs to the physics-based methods, which
have an additional requirement on physical plausibility. It follows a control-then-model paradigm
where the control is typically achieved by a learning algorithm, and the model is constrained by
a physics simulator. DeepMimic [34] uses reinforcement learning plus imitation learning to track
motion references and perform versatile motion controls. NCP [56] advances motion tracking with
discrete latent prior. Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) [36] uses generative adversarial imitation
learning to learn natural state transition from unstructured motion data. It is further extended with a
reusable controller [35], high-level language [21], expressive control [27], and latent conditions [46].
Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on the synthesis of interactive motions. InterPhys [15]
uses task-conditioned reward plus stylized adversarial reward to perform HSI tasks such as sitting,
lying, and box carrying. InterScene [33] extends the paradigm to synthesize long-horizon static
interactions. UniHSI [50] leverages the vast knowledge of the language model to provide a unified
interface for static HSI. However, previous works are limited to static objects or specific movable
objects but fail to interact with various objects. In contrast, our research studies general object
rearrangement in a daily room, posed with challenges in diverse object geometries, positions, and

eralized object rearrangement tasks by humanoids still pose significant challenges.
Previous
works [15, 33, 50] have been limited to simple tasks such as static sitting, lying, or carrying a
specific box. We propose new techniques to overcome challenges in generalized object rearrange-
ment. Generalized object interaction involves geometrically various objects. However, tracking
motion data for each individual object is labor-intensive, and infeasible to tackle novel objects. We
expect RL to enable automatic object generalization. Thus, we encode object geometry to learn a
geometry-aware policy and design a carry curriculum to facilitate the learning. Due to the misalign-
ment of objects in human motion data and the task, we propose style reward clipping to prioritize
high-level task execution. Navigating in a complex room requires high-level planning to avoid
collisions, we use in-context path planning to enable efficient locomotion. More detailed explanations
of our improved techniques are described in the following:"
STATE-BASED TEACHER POLICY LEARNING,0.14206128133704735,"Geometry Encoding. Object state is crucial in HSI synthesis. Previous studies [15, 47] primarily
encode object position, rotation, and linear and angular velocities to act on certain objects like
boxes or balls. A general policy for interactions with diverse objects should incorporate geometric
information. Thus, we augment the teacher policy with geometric object representations via Basis
Point Set (BPS) [37] encoding. A shared set of basis points is randomly sampled from a unit sphere
and encodes object geometry using delta vectors from each basis point to the nearest object point. In
contrast to geometries encoded by a neural net [38], BPS encoding is computationally efficient and
accelerates policy learning. Consequently, we use object geometry, position, rotation, and linear and
angular velocities to form a comprehensive object observation, thereby facilitating a more expressive
policy control."
STATE-BASED TEACHER POLICY LEARNING,0.14484679665738162,"Carry Curriculum Pre-training. Object rearrangement is conceptualized as a three-step process in
the aforementioned paragraph. However, directly learning the entire three-step rearrangement task
from scratch is challenging due to the long task horizon. Besides, physics-based object movement
presents greater challenges compared to kinematic object movement [24], primarily because the
object state is not directly editable. Instead, it requires indirect control of the physical humanoid
to interact. To this end, we draw inspiration from the curriculum learning [4] and design an easy
carry curriculum to pre-train the policy. The carry curriculum only includes the first two of three
steps: locomotion towards the object and carrying up the object for an in-the-air holding. The carry
curriculum has a shorter horizon and is empirically easier to converge. Furthermore, the pre-trained
in-the-air carry prior significantly benefits the subsequent object relocation. For the carry curriculum,
we use objects excluding those on the ground, such as tables and chairs, which are easier to move by
pushing and pulling along the ground without a lift. The carry curriculum shares the same learning
paradigm with the rearrangement task, except for a different two-stage reward design."
STATE-BASED TEACHER POLICY LEARNING,0.14763231197771587,"Style Reward Clipping. General object rearrangement involves manipulating novel objects that are
not recorded in tracked motion data. This creates a misalignment in optimization directions: strictly
imitating reference motion or ensuring high-level task execution. Previous work [15] balanced two
items by a weighted sum between task reward and style reward in motion-aligned tasks. However, in
our general object rearrangement setting, goal-conditioned task exploration progress can be stagnant
and the policy may learn actions devoid of task semantics following the logarithmic gradient in Eq. 2.
For instance, when the object is difficult to lift, the policy tends to mimic insignificant hand swings in
the motion data, rather than exploring carry-up actions. We insert a style reward clipping to prioritize
task execution, formulated as follows:"
STATE-BASED TEACHER POLICY LEARNING,0.15041782729805014,"ξt = max(rG(g, st, st+1), ξmin),

STATE-BASED TEACHER POLICY LEARNING,0.15598885793871867,"where wG, wS are coefficients, and ξt is the upper bound for the style reward. This formulation
prioritizes goal-conditioned task execution over motion imitation in reward maximization. In addition,
we use a minimum upper bound ξmin, to ensure basic motion imitation during the early stages when
the task reward is near zero."

DISTILLING INTO VISION-LANGUAGE-ACTION MODEL,0.20334261838440112,"Behavior Cloning. We train HumanVLA πvla using a teacher-student framework to distill the

B0 [45] for image encoding and a frozen bert-base-uncased [10] for language encoding, whose
features, along with proprioception, last action, are sent to the action decoder to derive an action.
At each time step t, HumanVLA-Teacher leverages privileged state st and g to derive an action
πtch(at|st, g) while HumanVLA derives an action πvla(at|pt, at−1, vt, l) based on proprioception
pt, last action at−1, egocentric image vt, and language instruction l. Behavior cloning bridges
distributions between πvla(at|pt, at−1, vt, l) and πtch(at|st, g), which can be directly implemented
via supervised learning. In the empirical training process, we observe a severe covariate shift problem
in offline behavior cloning. Thus, we opt for a DAgger [39] framework to train HumanVLA which
alleviates the problem via online learning."
DISTILLING INTO VISION-LANGUAGE-ACTION MODEL,0.20612813370473537,"Active Rendering. Though HumanVLA-Teacher possesses comprehensive knowledge in versatile
control, naive policy distillation still suffers from the gap of observation expressiveness. For instance,
while egocentric vision is used to perceive objects, the humanoid gaze might not properly focus on
the target object but renders a less informative image of the background. Consequently, the perception
quality of HumanVLA is significantly affected by the camera pose. However, an optimal camera
pose, determined by the head pose, is not guaranteed in the teacher policy, which only imitates a
life-like head motion but ignores the vision quality. We propose an active rendering technique to
encourage the camera to focus on the object. We analytically calculate the head-to-object direction in

Room (HITR) dataset, designed to facilitate vision-language directed object rearrangement tasks on
a humanoid. The HITR dataset includes carefully designed objects of various sizes, ranging from
21cm to 126cm, and provides a variety of rearrangement tasks in various rooms. Each task involves
separated, instantiable, and replaceable objects with defined initial and goal states. Additionally, each
task is accompanied by a natural language instruction generated by a Large Language Model (LLM)."
HUMAN-IN-THE-ROOM DATASET,0.22841225626740946,"In constructing the HITR dataset, we reference common objects used in room designs from [23, 44,
53] and utilize object models from HSSD [22] to create basic assets. Object assets are manually
resized to ensure the interaction friendliness. We adopt the procedural generation pipeline from [9]
to generate diverse scenes. First, we manually design four room layouts: bedroom, livingroom,
kitchen, and warehouse, then randomly populate replaceable objects within these layout templates
to establish the scene, as well as the goal state. Next, we randomly relocate an object in the scene,
either to the ground or another receptacle. This relocated object is what the physical humanoid is
tasked to rearrange. We concatenate two rendered images of the initial and goal scenes and use
the composite image to prompt gpt-4-vision [31] to generate an instruction. The LLM is asked to
distinguish between two states and provide an instruction to guide the state transition. However, the
LLM still struggles with understanding complex spatial relationships, such as left-right errors. To
ensure the quality of instructions, we manually review and revise them as necessary. Ultimately, we
build the HITR dataset of 615 tasks, with an average of 6.5 objects per task. There are 50 static
objects like bed and countertop, as well as 34 movable objects like pillow and vase. More details are
in the appendix."

SETTINGS,0.23676880222841226,"Datasets. Our experiments are conducted on the HITR dataset. It is split into train and test subsets
at a ratio of 9:1, containing 552 and 63 tasks respectively. The test subset is used to evaluate the
generalizability of our method in unseen tasks. For the motion dataset used in training, we utilize
OMOMO [24] and a locomotion subset from SAMP [14]. OMOMO provides a variety of short-range
motions involving moving different objects, while locomotion motions from SAMP enhance the
locomotion aspect of our dataset. We use 30-minute motions in total. The source motion dataset
features object rearrangement involving only seven different objects, which is far less than those in
the HITR dataset. Despite this, we anticipate that our method can generalize to different objects."
SETTINGS,0.2395543175487465,"Metrics. We adhere to a 10-second running time limit and follow [15] to evaluate methods with
three metrics. (1) Success Rate: the proportion of tasks that are successfully rearranged within an
error margin of θ. (2) Precision: the distance of the final object position to the goal. (3) Execution
Time the average time taken to complete a run. For the Success Rate, a higher value indicates
better performance, but for Precision and Execution Time, the lower the better. All experiments
are evaluated using 10 repeat runs. For state-based methods, we follow [15] to set θ = 20cm."

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS,0.27019498607242337,"We conduct experiments in parallel environments simulated using IsaacGym [28], with neural
networks implemented via PyTorch. Our physical humanoid model, following previous works [15,
33, 50], comprises 15 rigid bodies and 28 joints, each actuated by a PD-Controller. The simulator
runs at 60Hz, and the policy is queried at 30Hz. The teacher policy is optimized using Proximal
Policy Optimization [40] and takes two days on eight Tesla V100 GPUs to converge. The student
policy is trained using DAgger [39] and takes one day on two GPUs. We provide comprehensive
details about hyperparameters, neural architectures, observation space, and more in the appendix."

COMPARISONS IN BOX LOCO-MANIPULATION,0.2757660167130919,"While our work is pioneering in the exploration of vision-language-directed general object rear-
rangement, direct comparisons with previous studies are difficult. The work most similar to ours
is InterPhys [15], which delved into state-based box loco-manipulation. Due to the unavailability
of training data, motions, and codes of InterPhys [15], we instead refer to a box rearrangement
subset in HITR to conduct experiments. We train a state-based HumanVLA-Teacher using only
box rearrangement tasks, along with an implementation of the InterPhys baseline. Results of box
rearrangement are reported in Tab. 2. Given that the box is the simplest object to interact with, both
methods achieve high success rates. However, our method exhibits superior precision, with a result of
4.2 cm, outperforming both the 8.3 cm in the official report [15] and the 12.6 cm in our implementation.
We use the standard deviation to evaluate the statistical significance of HumanVLA-Teacher in 10
repeated runs. The values are 0.02, 0.004, and 0.04 for Success Rate, Precision, and Execution Time
respectively. With high task completion rates and low variance, we demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of our method in this first trial."

ABLATION STUDY,0.28133704735376047,"We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the train split to validate each design choice, with
results presented in Tab. 3. Firstly, we evaluate the impact of improved techniques in HumanVLA-
Teacher training, which achieves a success rate of 85.9% and a precision of 14.4cm. However,
eliminating any component leads to a decline in performance. The inclusion of geometry encoding
and carry curriculum enables the model to manipulate a variety of objects effectively. Without
either of these components, the success rate experiences a drop of approximately 20%. Style reward"

ABLATION STUDY,0.298050139275766,"clipping prioritizes task execution, whose absence results in a 6% decrease in the success rate. Path
planning helps humans navigate complex scenes. Its removal leads to a significant 18.5% decrease in
the success rate. Subsequently, we validate design choices in training HumanVLA directed by vision
and language. The default HumanVLA achieves a success rate of 74.8% with a precision of 42.6cm.
However, the absence of active rendering results in a substantial 6.9% success rate drop, emphasizing
the importance of perception quality. We implement an offline behavior cloning baseline using ten
off-the-shell teacher trajectories per task for training. Without online learning, the system suffers
from a severe covariate shift and performs poorly."

Generalizing to Unseen Tasks"
GENERALIZING TO UNSEEN TASKS,0.30362116991643456,"We use the test split of HITR to evaluate the generalizability of methods. The unseen data, which
includes novel scene compositions, visual appearances, and language instructions, poses a significant
challenge to our method. Results are presented in Tab. 4. The state-based HumanVLA-Teacher
tends to be more robust in unseen data. Relatively small drops in success rate (6.6%) and precision
(4.9cm) demonstrate strong generalizability of RL when using privileged information. Moreover, it
consistently outperforms the InterPhys [15] baseline on all metrics. Applying HumanVLA to unseen
tasks turns out to be more challenging due to the complexity of vision and language modalities.
The success rate of HumanVLA decreases to 60.2%, and the precision drops to 57.0cm. However,
HumanVLA still consistently outperforms baselines without active rendering and the offline goal-
conditioned behavior-cloning (Offline GC-BC) [29] method."

CONCLUSION,0.3147632311977716,"We investigate vision-language directed object rearrangement by physical humanoids in this work, a
fundamental technique for HSI synthesis and real-world humanoid robots. Our system is developed
using a teacher-student distillation framework. We propose key insights to facilitate teacher policy
learning with privileged states and introduce a novel active perception technique to favor vision-
language-action model learning. We present a novel HITR dataset to support our task. In extensive
experiments, our HumanVLA model demonstrates superior results in both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Future works include dexterous manipulation by physical humanoids and long-horizon
multi-object interaction."

the camera’s target view, which is the forward direction. To determine this, we compute the center
of the object point cloud and use it as the target viewpoint. The direction from the camera position
to the point cloud center represents the expected forward direction of both the camera and the head.
Since the neck joint is a 3-DoF spherical joint, a single regulation can lead to ambiguous actions.
To address this, we introduce the second regulation that controls the side direction of the head. It is
perpendicular to the plane formed by the upward torso and the camera view. These two regulations

CLAIMS,0.8467966573816156,1. Claims
CLAIMS,0.8495821727019499,"Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This work studies vision-language directed object rearrangement. It have been
described in the abstract and introduction.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8523676880222841,"• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations"
CLAIMS,0.8551532033426184,"Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Limitations are in the appendix.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8579387186629527,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs"
CLAIMS,0.8607242339832869,"Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]"
CLAIMS,0.8635097493036211,"Justification: No theoretical results.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8662952646239555,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility"
CLAIMS,0.8690807799442897,"Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide complete details in the appendix.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.871866295264624,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code"
CLAIMS,0.8746518105849582,"Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?"
CLAIMS,0.8774373259052924,"Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Data and code are publicly available.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8802228412256268,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details"
CLAIMS,0.883008356545961,"Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide complete details in the appendix.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8857938718662952,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance"
CLAIMS,0.8885793871866295,"Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Statistical significance is reported in Sec. 5.3. We report the standard deviation
in 10 repeated runs to validate the robustness of our method. For a consistent result format
with InterPhys, they are not included in the main table.
Guidelines:"
CLAIMS,0.8913649025069638,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors)."
CLAIMS,0.8941504178272981,"• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text."

puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?"
EXPERIMENTS COMPUTE RESOURCES,0.9025069637883009,Answer: [Yes]
EXPERIMENTS COMPUTE RESOURCES,0.9052924791086351,Justification: Compute costs are in Sec. 5.2.
EXPERIMENTS COMPUTE RESOURCES,0.9080779944289693,Guidelines:
EXPERIMENTS COMPUTE RESOURCES,0.9108635097493036,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper)."

CODE OF ETHICS,0.9275766016713092,"• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction)."
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9303621169916435,10. Broader Impacts
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9331476323119777,"Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?"
BROADER IMPACTS,0.935933147632312,Answer: [Yes]
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9387186629526463,Justification: Broader impacts are in the appendix.
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9415041782729805,Guidelines:
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9442896935933147,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations."
BROADER IMPACTS,0.947075208913649,"• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."
SAFEGUARDS,0.9498607242339833,11. Safeguards
SAFEGUARDS,0.9526462395543176,"Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?"
SAFEGUARDS,0.9554317548746518,Answer: [NA]
SAFEGUARDS,0.958217270194986,Justification: No such risks.
SAFEGUARDS,0.9610027855153204,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9637883008356546,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
