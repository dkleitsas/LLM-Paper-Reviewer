ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0035211267605633804,"Synthesis planning and reaction outcome prediction are two fundamental prob-
lems in computer-aided organic chemistry for which a variety of data-driven ap-
proaches have emerged. Natural language approaches that model each problem as
a SMILES-to-SMILES translation lead to a simple end-to-end formulation, reduce
the need for data preprocessing, and enable the use of well-optimized machine
translation model architectures. However, SMILES representations are not an ef-
ﬁcient representation for capturing information about molecular structures, as ev-
idenced by the success of SMILES augmentation to boost empirical performance.
Here, we describe a novel Graph2SMILES model that combines the power of
Transformer models for text generation with the permutation invariance of molec-
ular graph encoders that mitigates the need for input data augmentation. As an
end-to-end architecture, Graph2SMILES can be used as a drop-in replacement
for the Transformer in any task involving molecule(s)-to-molecule(s) transforma-
tions. In our encoder, an attention-augmented directed message passing neural
network (D-MPNN) captures local chemical environments, and the global atten-
tion encoder allows for long-range and intermolecular interactions, enhanced by
graph-aware positional embedding. Graph2SMILES improves the top-1 accuracy
of the Transformer baselines by 1.7% and 1.9% for reaction outcome prediction
on USPTO_480k and USPTO_STEREO datasets respectively, and by 9.8% for
one-step retrosynthesis on the USPTO_50k dataset."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01056338028169014,"Retrosynthetic analysis (Corey, 1988; Corey & Cheng, 1989) and its reverse problem, reaction out-
come prediction (Corey & Wipke, 1969), are two fundamental problems in computer-aided organic
synthesis. The former tries to propose possible reaction precursors given the desirable product,
whereas the latter aims to predict the major products given reactants. Historically, they were tackled
using rule-based expert systems such as LHASA (Corey et al., 1972). Recent developments in ma-
chine learning have led to a number of new template-based, graph edit-based, and translation-based
methods, for which we give a detailed review in Section 3.1. For both tasks, translation-based ap-
proaches have grown popular, possibly because the end-to-end formulation is procedurally simple.
Since most organic molecules can be represented as SMILES strings (Neglur et al., 2005), retrosyn-
thesis can be cast as a translation from product SMILES to reactant SMILES (Liu et al., 2017), and
so can reaction outcome prediction (Nam & Kim, 2016). Modeling these tasks as machine trans-
lation problems enables the use of neural architectures that are well-studied and well-optimized in
the ﬁeld of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Several of the best performing models across mul-
tiple benchmark datasets (Tetko et al., 2020; Irwin et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2020; Seo et al., 2021;
Wang et al., 2021b) have used the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) as the backbone
on SMILES representations, showing the effectiveness of translation-based formulation."
INTRODUCTION,0.014084507042253521,"However, SMILES representations do not provide bijective mappings to molecular structure. As a
result, data augmentation with chemically-equivalent SMILES (Bjerrum, 2017) has become a com-
mon practice to improve empirical performance. Augmenting the training data with just 1 equivalent
reaction SMILES by permuting both the inputs and the outputs can already produce noticeable im-
provements of 0.8% to 4.3% (Schwaller et al., 2019; Seo et al., 2021). Incorporating 9 (Wang et al.,"

INTRODUCTION,0.02112676056338028,"2021b), or up to 100 (Tetko et al., 2020) equivalent SMILES can provide additional gains. While
these efforts demonstrate the effectiveness of SMILES augmentation, this introduces a non-trivial
choice as to how much augmentation should be done. The performance has not saturated even
with 100 augmented SMILES (Tetko et al., 2020), but this may signiﬁcantly complicate the model
pipeline, especially during test time which typically necessitates de-duplication, ensembling, and
heuristic-based scoring (Wang et al., 2021b; Tetko et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.02464788732394366,"In this paper, we propose a novel graph-to-sequence architecture called Graph2SMILES to solve
the tasks of retrosynthesis and reaction prediction. We ﬁrst design a sequential graph encoder with
an attention-augmented directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) based on Yang et al.
(2019) and optionally augmented by attention-based message updates, followed by a Transformer-
based global attention encoder with graph-aware positional embedding. We then pair the graph
encoder with a Transformer decoder to transform molecular graph inputs into SMILES outputs,
without using sequence representations of input SMILES at all. As such, we guarantee the permu-
tation invariance of Graph2SMILES to the input, eliminating the need for input-side augmentation
altogether. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:"
INTRODUCTION,0.028169014084507043,"1. We propose a Graph2SMILES architecture with two encoder components modeling local
and global atomic interactions respectively, to address forward prediction and one-step
retrosynthesis as graph-to-sequence tasks.
2. We design a graph-aware positional embedding to further enhance performance. It is easily
generalizable to graphs containing two or more molecules, while not requiring any pre-
training or joint training with auxiliary tasks.
3. We demonstrate the adequacy of graph representations alone by showing that
Graph2SMILES outperforms Transformer baselines on predictive chemistry tasks without
needing any input-side SMILES augmentation."
INTRODUCTION,0.03169014084507042,"Our Graph2SMILES architecture achieves state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy on common benchmarks
among methods that do not make use of reaction templates, atom mapping, pretraining, or data
augmentation strategies. We emphasize that Graph2SMILES is a backbone architecture, and hence
a drop-in replacement for the Transformer model. As such, Graph2SMILES can be plugged into
any method for molecular transformation tasks that uses the Transformer model, while retraining
the beneﬁts from techniques or features orthogonal to the architecture itself."

nodes and bonds as edges. We represent the input molecule(s) as graphs, and the output molecule(s)

Unlike atom-oriented message updates in edge-aware MPNNs (Hu et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020;

recent efforts have used neural networks to model the two tasks as template classiﬁcation (Segler &
Waller, 2017; Baylon et al., 2019; Dai et al., 2019a; Chen & Jung, 2021), or template ranking based
on molecular similarity (Coley et al., 2017). These template-based approaches select the top ranked
templates, which can then be applied to transform the input molecules into the outputs."
REACTION OUTCOME PREDICTION AND ONE-STEP RETROSYNTHESIS,0.352112676056338,"For template-based methods, there is an inevitable tradeoff between template generality and speci-
ﬁcity. Further, these methods cannot generalize to unseen templates. As a remediation for such in-
trinsic limitations, a number of template-free approaches have emerged over the recent years, which
can be categorized into graph edit-based and translation-based. The ﬁrst category models reaction
prediction or retrosynthesis as graph transformations (Jin et al., 2017; Coley et al., 2019; Do et al.,
2019; Bradshaw et al., 2019; Sacha et al., 2021; Qian et al., 2020). Variants of graph edit methods
include electron ﬂow prediction (Bi et al., 2021) and semi template-based methods where reaction
centers are ﬁrst identiﬁed, followed by a graph or sequence recovery stage (Shi et al., 2020; Yan
et al., 2020; Somnath et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021b). Translation-based formulations, on the other
hand, approach the problems as SMILES-to-SMILES translation, typically with sequence models
such as Recurrent Neural Networks (Nam & Kim, 2016; Schwaller et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017) or
the Transformer (Schwaller et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2019; Duan et al., 2020; Tetko
et al., 2020). Variants of these approaches design additional stages such as pretraining and reranking
(Irwin et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020), or use information about
graph topology to enhance performance (Yoo et al., 2020; Seo et al., 2021; Mao et al., 2021)."
REACTION OUTCOME PREDICTION AND ONE-STEP RETROSYNTHESIS,0.35563380281690143,"Our approach is similar to GET (Mao et al., 2021) which also solves one-step retrosynthesis with
graph-enhanced encoders and sequence decoders. Unlike GET which concatenates the SMILES
sequence embeddings and learned atom representations, thereby not guaranteeing permutation in-
variance, we do not use the sequence representation at all in our encoder. Yet Graph2SMILES yields
signiﬁcant improvement over GET on USPTO_50k, demonstrating the power of our graph encoder
and the adequacy of graph representations alone."

ADAPTING THE TRANSFORMER ENCODER FOR MOLECULAR REPRESENTATION,0.3626760563380282,"The idea of modeling graphs using the Transformer architecture is not new. In the domain of molec-
ular representation, the Molecular Attention Transformer (Maziarka et al., 2020) and GeoT (Kwak
et al., 2021) inject atomic distance information into when computing attention scores. However,
the computation of such distance information itself requires sampling of 3D conformers, thereby
introducing an additional source of variations and breaking order invariance. An alternative is using
the lengths of shortest paths between atoms. GRAT (Yoo et al., 2020) uses these lengths to pa-
rameterize the optional scale and bias for the attention score, whereas PAGTN (Chen et al., 2019)"

tween atoms for our Transformer-based global attention encoder are inspired by GRAT and PAGTN.
Contrary to their usage of these lengths as additional features, we explicitly separate the effect of
graph topology using graph-aware relative positional embedding, considering the success of such
specially designed embedding in graph representation (Ying et al., 2021) and other domains (Shaw
et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019b; Wang et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020). Our formulation of relative
positional embedding builds on top of its counterpart in Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019b), which
we found to be empirically superior than using single learnable bias as in T5 (Raffel et al., 2020)
and Graphormer (Ying et al., 2021)."

sequence representation as an input as in GET, or require the output molecular graph in the encoder
as in NERF. Also, none of these related works retain the explicit information about graph topology
before passing the atom representations into the attention encoder like we do, which we show to
be important in the ablation study in Section 4.5. Similarly, the graph-to-sequence formulation
itself has been used in NLP for conditional text generation tasks such as SQL-to-text (Xu et al.,
2018a;b) and AMR-to-text (Cai & Lam, 2020). Our encoder is different from these prior studies;
most notably, the graph-aware positional embedding is designed to easily generalize to more than
two disconnected graphs, which is typical for reaction outcome prediction."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.528169014084507,"Throughout our experiments, to demonstrate the advantage over a vanilla Transformer, we have
focused on the baseline Graph2SMILES model, forgoing the beneﬁts of using additional features
and techniques for performance engineering. Although we have used the top-1 accuracy as a basis
for comparison throughout our discussion, we recognize its limitations especially for retrosynthesis,
which can have many equally plausible options. Similarly, the datasets we use for reaction outcome
prediction are not perfectly detailed, with legitimate ambiguity in the identity of the major product.
While Graph2SMILES shows strong performance for top-1 accuracy and can replace Transformer
model with minimal modiﬁcation to the pipeline, there could be cases when top-n accuracy is more
relevant (e.g. in multi-step planning applications). In those cases, the aforementioned performance
engineering techniques would be necessary to boost the top-n performance of Graph2SMILES."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.5352112676056338,"In this paper, we present a novel Graph2SMILES model for template-free reaction outcome pre-
diction and retrosynthesis. The permutation invariance of its D-MPNN and graph-aware positional
embedding eliminates the need for any input-side SMILES augmentation, while achieving notice-
able improvement over the Transformer baselines, especially for top-1 accuracy. Graph2SMILES
is therefore an attractive drop-in replacement for any methods that use the Transformer model for
molecular transformation tasks. Further gain may be possible through performance engineering
tricks that are orthogonal to the architecture itself, which will be investigated in future work."

REFERENCES,0.9929577464788732,"The ﬁrst two rows represent two intramolecular ring forming reactions after an N-alkylation or ami-
dation. As shown by the right-most molecules, without explicit knowledge of the reactant graphs,
Molecular Transformer instead predicts substitution reactions at the benzylic carbon and at the
phenyl carbon respectively. Both predictions seem to be based solely on local chemical environ-
ments, with the ﬁrst being plausible as nucleophilic substitution on benzyl bromide, but the second
nonsensical since such electrophilic aromatic substitution would not happen with the nucleophilic
phenylamine. Graph2SMILES, on the other hand, correctly predicts the ring formation. We there-
fore hypothesize that graph representation may be more powerful at encoding beyond local contexts
via its global attention mechanism, which is potentially important for such reactions. Further quan-
titative evaluation is left as future work, since explainability is not a trivial task for template-free
models."
REFERENCES,0.9964788732394366,"The third row represents the removal of the amine group attached to the benzene ring, for which
Graph2SMILES gives the correct prediction, but the Molecular Transformer predicts the formation
of an aryl hydrazine, possibly by detecting the extra nitrogen in the input SMILES (from DMF)
but failing to realize it as merely a spectator solvent without full recognition of its graph structure.
The last row is a case where Graph2SMILES predicts the correct regioselectivity (ortho vs. para to
the nitro group) for the aromatic substitution reaction. This may be interpreted as better capability
of Graph2SMILES to learn longer range topological information as compared to the Transformer
baseline."
