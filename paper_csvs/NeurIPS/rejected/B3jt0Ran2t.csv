27"
INTRODUCTION,0.019444444444444445,"Despite its significance, the challenge posed by complementarities in preferences often leads to the
28"

30"
INTRODUCTION,0.021527777777777778,"1999]. Couples typically view pairs of jobs as complements, which can result in the non-existence of
31"

INTRODUCTION,0.022916666666666665,"matching is known to be NP-hard, even in restrictive settings [Ronn, 1990, McDermid and Manlove,
33"
INTRODUCTION,0.02361111111111111,"2010, Biró et al., 2014].
34"
INTRODUCTION,0.024305555555555556,"Nevertheless, real-life markets of substantial scale do exhibit stable matchings even in the presence

INTRODUCTION,0.025694444444444443,"participants from 1999 to 2007. Kojima et al. [2013] and Ashlagi et al. [2014] demonstrate that if the

INTRODUCTION,0.027777777777777776,"In this paper, we shift our attention to daycare matching markets in Japan, where the issue of waiting

INTRODUCTION,0.029166666666666667,"[Kamada and Kojima, 2023]. The daycare matching problem is a natural extension of matching with

INTRODUCTION,0.03194444444444444,"The objective of this research is to gain a more nuanced understanding of why stable matchings exist
46"
INTRODUCTION,0.03263888888888889,"in practical daycare markets. Recently, stable matchings have been reported in these markets where
47"

48"
INTRODUCTION,0.034027777777777775,"[Sun et al., 2023, 2024]. Furthermore, theoretical guarantees established in prior research on matching
49"
INTRODUCTION,0.034722222222222224,"with couples may not readily extend to the daycare market, primarily due to two key factors. Firstly,
50"
INTRODUCTION,0.035416666666666666,"a distinctive characteristic of Japanese daycare markets is the substantial proportion, approximately
51"
INTRODUCTION,0.03611111111111111,"20%, of children with siblings. This stands in contrast to the assumption of near-linear growth of
52"
INTRODUCTION,0.03680555555555556,"couples in previous research [Ashlagi et al., 2014]. Secondly, we consider a stronger stability concept
53"
INTRODUCTION,0.0375,"tailored for daycare markets. Our proposal has been presented to government officials and esteemed
54"
INTRODUCTION,0.03819444444444445,"economists, who concur that this modification better suits the daycare markets1.
55"
INTRODUCTION,0.03888888888888889,"Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
56"
INTRODUCTION,0.03958333333333333,"Firstly, we formalize a large random market that mirrors the characteristics of realistic daycare
57"

58"
INTRODUCTION,0.04097222222222222,"distributions. A significant trait observed in practical markets is the tendency for daycares to exhibit
59"
INTRODUCTION,0.041666666666666664,"similar priorities over children. Our central result demonstrates that, in such random markets, the
60"
INTRODUCTION,0.04236111111111111,"probability of a stable matching existing approaches 1 as the market size tends to infinity (Theorem 1).
61"
INTRODUCTION,0.043055555555555555,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explain the existence of stable matchings in

INTRODUCTION,0.044444444444444446,"Secondly, we modify the Sorted Deferred Acceptance algorithm [Ashlagi et al., 2014] to address our
