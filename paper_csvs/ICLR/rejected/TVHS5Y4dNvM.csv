ABSTRACT,0.00425531914893617,"Although convolutional networks have been the dominant architecture for vision
tasks for many years, recent experiments have shown that Transformer-based mod-
els, most notably the Vision Transformer (ViT), may exceed their performance in
some settings. However, due to the quadratic runtime of the self-attention layers
in Transformers, ViTs require the use of patch embeddings, which group together
small regions of the image into single input features, in order to be applied to
larger image sizes. This raises a question: Is the performance of ViTs due to the
inherently-more-powerful Transformer architecture, or is it at least partly due to
using patches as the input representation? In this paper, we present some evidence
for the latter: speciﬁcally, we propose the ConvMixer, an extremely simple model
that is similar in spirit to the ViT and the even-more-basic MLP-Mixer in that it
operates directly on patches as input, separates the mixing of spatial and channel
dimensions, and maintains equal size and resolution throughout the network. In
contrast, however, the ConvMixer uses only standard convolutions to achieve the
mixing steps. Despite its simplicity, we show that the ConvMixer outperforms the
ViT, MLP-Mixer, and some of their variants for similar parameter counts and data
set sizes, in addition to outperforming classical vision models such as the ResNet.

INTRODUCTION,0.02553191489361702,"For many years, convolutional neural networks have been
the dominant architecture for deep learning systems ap-
plied to computer vision tasks. But recently, architectures
based upon Transformer models, e.g., the so-called Vision
Transformer architecture (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), have
demonstrated compelling performance in many of these
tasks, often outperforming classical convolutional archi-
tectures, especially for large data sets. An understandable
assumption, then, is that it is only a matter of time be-
fore Transformers become the dominant architecture for
vision domains, just as they have for language processing.
In order to apply Transformers to images, however, the
representation had to be changed: because the computa-
tional cost of the self-attention layers used in Transformers
would scale quadratically with the number of pixels per
image if applied naively at the per-pixel level, the compromise was to ﬁrst split the image into multiple
“patches”, linearly embed them, and then apply the transformer directly to this collection of patches."
INTRODUCTION,0.029787234042553193,"In this work, we explore the question of whether, fundamentally, the strong performance of vision
transformers may result more from this patch-based representation than from the Transformer archi-
tecture itself. We develop a very simple convolutional architecture which we dub the “ConvMixer”
due to its similarity to the recently-proposed MLP-Mixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021). This architecture
is similar to the Vision Transformer (and MLP-Mixer) in many respects: it directly operates on
patches, it maintains an equal-resolution-and-size representation throughout all layers, it does no
downsampling of the representation at successive layers, and it separates “channel-wise mixing”"

architecture does all these operations via only standard convolutions."
INTRODUCTION,0.13191489361702127,"The chief result we show in this paper is that this ConvMixer architecture, despite its extreme sim-
plicity (it can be implemented in ≈6 lines of dense PyTorch code), outperforms both “standard”
computer vision models such as ResNets of similar parameter counts and some corresponding Vision
Transformer and MLP-Mixer variants, even with a slate of additions intended to make those architec-
tures more performant on smaller data sets. Importantly, this is despite the fact that we did not design
our experiments to maximize accuracy nor speed, in contrast to the models we compared against.
Our results suggest that, at least to some extent, the patch representation itself may be a critical com-
ponent to the “superior” performance of newer architectures like Vision Transformers. While these
results are naturally just a snapshot, and more experiments are required to exactly disentangle the
eﬀect of patch embeddings from other factors, we believe that this provides a strong “convolutional-
but-patch-based” baseline to compare against for more advanced architectures in the future."

of a simple fully-convolutional block. We maintain the spatial structure of the patch embeddings,
as illustrated in Fig. 2. Patch embeddings with patch size p and embedding dimension h can be

INTRODUCTION,0.2127659574468085,"model, (4) the kernel size k of the depthwise convolutional layer. We name ConvMixers after their
hidden dimension and depth, like ConvMixer-h/d. We refer to the original input size n divided by the
patch size p as the internal resolution; note, however, that ConvMixers support variable-sized inputs."
INTRODUCTION,0.2170212765957447,"Motivation. Our architecture is based on the idea of mixing, as in Tolstikhin et al. (2021). In
particular, we chose depthwise convolution to mix spatial locations and pointwise convolution to
mix channel locations. A key idea from previous work is that MLPs and self-attention can mix
distant spatial locations, i.e., they can have an arbitrarily large receptive ﬁeld. Consequently, we used
convolutions with an unusually large kernel size to mix distant spatial locations."
INTRODUCTION,0.22127659574468084,"While self-attention and MLPs are theoretically more ﬂexible, allowing for large receptive ﬁelds
and content-aware behavior, the inductive bias of convolution is well-suited to vision tasks and
leads to high data eﬃciency. By using such a standard operation, we also get a glimpse into the
eﬀect of the patch representation itself in contrast to the conventional pyramid-shaped, progressively-
downsampling design of convolutional networks."

Experiments"
EXPERIMENTS,0.2297872340425532,"Training setup. We primarily evaluate ConvMixers on ImageNet-1k classiﬁcation without any
pretraining or additional data. We added ConvMixer to the timm framework (Wightman, 2019) and
trained it with nearly-standard settings: we used RandAugment (Cubuk et al., 2020), mixup (Zhang
et al., 2017), CutMix (Yun et al., 2019), random erasing (Zhong et al., 2020), and gradient norm
clipping in addition to default timm augmentation. We used the AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2018) optimizer and a simple triangular learning rate schedule. Due to limited compute, we did
absolutely no hyperparameter tuning on ImageNet and trained for fewer epochs than competitors.
Consequently, our models could be over- or under-regularized, and the accuracies we report likely
underestimate the capabilities of our model."
EXPERIMENTS,0.23404255319148937,"Results. A ConvMixer-1536/20 with 52M parameters can achieve 81.4% top-1 accuracy on Ima-
geNet, and a ConvMixer-768/32 with 21M parameters 80.2% (see Table 1). Wider ConvMixers seem
to converge in fewer epochs, but are memory- and compute-hungry. They also work best with large
kernel sizes: ConvMixer-1536/20 lost ≈1% accuracy when reducing the kernel size from k = 9
to k = 3 (we discuss kernel sizes more in Appendix A & B). ConvMixers with smaller patches are
substantially better in our experiments, similarly to Sandler et al. (2019); we believe larger patches
require deeper ConvMixers. With everything held equal except increasing the patch size from 7 to
14, ConvMixer-1536/20 achieves 78.9% top-1 accuracy but is around 4× faster. We trained one
model with ReLU to demonstrate that GELU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016), which is popular in
recent isotropic models, isn’t necessary."
EXPERIMENTS,0.23829787234042554,"Comparisons. Our model and ImageNet1k-only training setup closely resemble that of recent patch-
based models like DeiT (Touvron et al., 2020). Due to ConvMixer’s simplicity, we focus on comparing
to only the most basic isotropic patch-based architectures adapted to the ImageNet-1k setting, namely
DeiT and ResMLP. Attempting a fair comparison with a standard baseline, we trained ResNets using
exactly the same parameters as ConvMixers; while this choice of parameters is suboptimal (Wightman
et al., 2021), it is likely also suboptimal for ConvMixers, since we did no hyperparameter tuning."
EXPERIMENTS,0.2425531914893617,Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
EXPERIMENTS,0.24680851063829787,"Looking at Table 1 and Fig. 1, ConvMixers achieve competitive accuracies for a given parameter
budget: ConvMixer-1536/20 outperforms both ResNet-152 and ResMLP-B24 despite having sub-
stantially fewer parameters and is competitive with DeiT-B. ConvMixer-768/32 uses just a third of
the parameters of ResNet-152, but is similarly accurate. Note that unlike ConvMixer, the DeiT and
ResMLP results involved hyperparameter tuning, and when substantial resources are dedicated to tun-
ing ResNets, including training for twice as many epochs, they only outperform an equivalently-sized
ConvMixer by ≈0.2% (Wightman et al., 2021). However, ConvMixers are substantially slower at
inference than the competitors, likely due to their smaller patch size; hyperparameter tuning and opti-
mizations could narrow this gap. For more discussion and comparisons, see Table 2 and Appendix A."
EXPERIMENTS,0.251063829787234,"CIFAR-10 Experiments. We also performed smaller-scale experiments on CIFAR-10, where Con-
vMixers achieve over 96% accuracy with as few as 0.7M parameters, demonstrating the data eﬃciency
of the convolutional inductive bias. Details of these experiments are presented in Appendix B."

Related Work"
RELATED WORK,0.25957446808510637,"Isotropic architectures. Vision transformers have inspired a new paradigm of “isotropic” archi-
tectures, i.e., those with equal size and shape throughout the network, which use patch embeddings
for the ﬁrst layer.
These models look similar to repeated transformer-encoder blocks (Vaswani
et al., 2017) with diﬀerent operations replacing the self-attention and MLP operations.
For
example, MLP-Mixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021) replaces them both with MLPs applied across
diﬀerent dimensions (i.e., spatial and channel location mixing); ResMLP (Touvron et al., 2021a)
is a data-eﬃcient variation on this theme.
CycleMLP (Chen et al., 2021), gMLP (Liu et al.,
2021a), and vision permutator (Hou et al., 2021), replace one or both blocks with various novel
operations.
These are all quite performant, which is typically attributed to the novel choice of
operations. In contrast, Melas-Kyriazi (2021) proposed an MLP-based isotropic vision model, and
also hypothesized patch embeddings could be behind its performance. ResMLP tried replacing its
linear interaction layer with (small-kernel) convolution and achieved good performance, but kept
its MLP-based cross-channel layer and did not explore convolutions further. As our investigation of
ConvMixers suggests, these works may conﬂate the eﬀect of the new operations (like self-attention
and MLPs) with the eﬀect of the use of patch embeddings and the resulting isotropic architecture."
RELATED WORK,0.26382978723404255,"A study predating vision transformers investigates isotropic (or “isometric”) MobileNets (Sandler
et al., 2019), and even implements patch embeddings under another name. Their architecture simply
repeats an isotropic MobileNetv3 block. They identify a tradeoﬀbetween patch size and accuracy that
matches our experience, and train similarly performant models (see Appendix A, Table 2). However,
their block is substantially more complex than ours; simplicity and motivation sets our work apart."
RELATED WORK,0.2680851063829787,"Patches aren’t all you need. Several papers have increased vision transformer performance by
replacing standard patch embeddings with a diﬀerent stem: Xiao et al. (2021) and Yuan et al.
(2021a) use a standard convolutional stem, while Yuan et al. (2021b) repeatedly combines nearby
patch embeddings. However, this conﬂates the eﬀect of using patch embeddings with the eﬀect of
adding convolution or similar inductive biases e.g., locality. We attempt to focus on the use of patches."
RELATED WORK,0.2723404255319149,"CNNs meet ViTs. Many eﬀorts have been made to incorporate features of convolutional networks
into vision transformers and vice versa. Self-attention can emulate convolution (Cordonnier et al.,
2019) and can be initialized or regularized to be like it (d’Ascoli et al., 2021); other works simply add
convolution operations to transformers (Dai et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2021), or include downsampling
to be more like traditional pyramid-shaped convolutional networks (Wang et al., 2021). Conversely,
self-attention or attention-like operations can supplement or replace convolution in ResNet-style
models (Bello et al., 2019; Ramachandran et al., 2019; Bello, 2021). While all of these attempts have
been successful in one way or another, they are orthogonal to this work, which aims to emphasize the
eﬀect of the architecture common to most ViTs by showcasing it with a less-expressive operation."

CONCLUSION,0.28936170212765955,"a substantial performance boost. While neither our model nor our experiments were designed to max-
imize accuracy or speed, i.e., we did not search for good hyperparameters, ConvMixers outperform
the Vision Transformer and MLP-Mixer, and are competitive with ResNets, DeiTs, and ResMLPs."
CONCLUSION,0.2936170212765957,"We provided evidence that the increasingly common “isotropic” architecture with a simple patch
embedding stem is itself a powerful template for deep learning. Patch embeddings allow all the
downsampling to happen at once, immediately decreasing the internal resolution and thus increasing
the eﬀective receptive ﬁeld size, making it easier to mix distant spatial information. Our title, while an
exaggeration, points out that attention isn’t the only export from language processing into computer
vision: tokenizing inputs, i.e., using patch embeddings, is also a powerful and important takeaway."
CONCLUSION,0.2978723404255319,"While our model is not state-of-the-art, we ﬁnd its simple patch-mixing design to be compelling. We
hope that ConvMixers can serve as a baseline for future patch-based architectures with novel opera-
tions, or that they can provide a basic template for new conceptually simple and performant models."
CONCLUSION,0.3021276595744681,"Future work. We are optimistic that a deeper ConvMixer with larger patches could reach a desirable
tradeoﬀbetween accuracy, parameters, and throughput after longer training and more regularization
and hyperparameter tuning, similarly to how Wightman et al. (2021) enhanced ResNet performance
through carefully-designed training regimens. Low-level optimization of large-kernel depthwise
convolution could substantially increase throughput, and small enhancements to our architecture like
the addition of bottlenecks or a more expressive classiﬁer could trade simplicity for performance."
CONCLUSION,0.30638297872340425,"Due to its large internal resolution and isotropic design, ConvMixer may be especially well-suited for
semantic segmentation, and it would be useful to run experiments on this task with a ConvMixer-like
model and on other tasks such as object detection. More experiments could be designed to more
clearly extricate the eﬀect of patch embeddings from other architectural choices. In particular, for a
more in-depth comparison to ViTs and MLP-Mixers, which excel when trained on very large data sets,
it is important to investigate the performance of ConvMixers in the regime of large-scale pre-training."
CONCLUSION,0.31063829787234043,"A note on paper length. Expecting more text in this paper? Wondering if it’s a workshop paper we
hastily submitted to ICLR? No. This paper presents a simple idea, one where we genuinely believe
that a short paper presentation is more eﬀective. Do we really need exactly 8 (now 9? 10?) pages to
describe every machine learning architecture and algorithm in existence? We proposed an incredibly
simple architecture and made a very simple point that we think is worth more discussion: patches
work well in convolutional architectures. We think that four and a half pages is more than enough
space for this. The details of the experiments and architectures are in the appendix for those who
want to read through it all."

an optimal strategy, however, we were aware from our early experiments on CIFAR-10 that results
seemed robust to various small changes. We did not have access to suﬃcient compute to attempt
to tune hyperparameters for each model: e.g., larger ConvMixers could probably beneﬁt from more
regularization than we chose, and smaller ones from less regularization. Keeping the parameters the

150 epochs, and ConvMixer-768/32 is over twice as fast, making 300 epochs more feasible."
REFERENCES,0.5531914893617021,"If anything, we believe that in the worst case, the lack of parameter tuning in our experiments resulted
in underestimating the accuracies of ConvMixers. Further, due to our limited compute and the fact
that large models (particularly ConvMixers) are expensive to train on large data sets, we generally
trained our models for fewer epochs than competition like DeiT and ResMLP (see Table 2)."
REFERENCES,0.5574468085106383,"A note on throughput. We measured throughput using batches of 64 images in half precision on a
single RTX8000 GPU, averaged over 20 such batches. In particular, we measured CUDA execution
time rather than “wall-clock” time. We noticed discrepancies in the relative throughputs of models,
e.g., Touvron et al. (2020) reports that ResNet-152 is 2× faster than DeiT-B, but our measurements
show that it is only 1.25× faster. We therefore speculate that our throughputs may underestimate the
performance of ResNets and ConvMixers relative to the transformers. The diﬀerence may be due
to using RTX8000 rather than V100 GPUs, or other low-level diﬀerences. Our throughputs were
similar for batch sizes 32 and 128."

using exactly the same training setup and parameters as ConvMixer-1536/20. Despite having fewer
parameters and being architecturally much simpler, ConvMixers substantially outperform these
ResNets in terms of accuracy. A possible confounding factor is that ConvMixers use GELU, which
may boost performance, while ResNets use ReLU. In an attempt to rule out this confound, we used
ReLU in a later ConvMixer-768/32 experiment and found that it still achieved competitive accuracy.
We also note that the choice of ReLU vs. GELU was not important on CIFAR-10 experiments (see
Table 3). However, ConvMixers do have substantially less throughput."
REFERENCES,0.5659574468085107,"DeiTs. We believe that DeiT is the most reasonable comparison in terms of vision transformers: It
only adds additional regularization, as opposed to architectural additions in the case of CaiT (Touvron
et al., 2021b), and is then essentially a “vanilla” ViT modulo the distillation token (we don’t consider
distilled architectures). In terms of a ﬁxed parameter budget, ConvMixers generally outperform
DeiTs. For example, ConvMixer-1536/20 is only 0.43% less accurate than DeiT-B despite having
over 30M fewer parameters; ConvMixer-768/32 is 0.36% more accurate than DeiT-S despite having
0.9M fewer parameters; and ConvMixer-512/16 is 0.39% more accurate than DeiT-Ti for nearly the
same number of parameters. Admittedly, none of the ConvMixers are very competitive in terms of
throughput, with the closest being the ConvMixer-512/16 which is 5× slower than DeiT-Ti."
REFERENCES,0.5702127659574469,"A confounding factor is the diﬀerence in patch size between DeiT and ConvMixer; DeiT uses p = 16
while ConvMixer uses p = 7. This means DeiT is substantially faster. However, ConvMixers using
larger patches are not as competitive. While we were not able to train DeiTs with larger patch sizes, it is
possible that they would outperform ConvMixers on the parameter count vs. accuracy curve; however,
we tested their throughput for p = 7, and they are even slower than ConvMixers. Given the diﬀerence
between convolution and self-attention, we are not sure it is salient to control for patch size diﬀerences."
REFERENCES,0.574468085106383,"DeiTs were subject to more hyperparameter tuning than ConvMixers, as well as longer training
times.
They also used stochastic depth while we did not, which can in some cases contribute
percent diﬀerences in model accuracy (Touvron et al., 2021a). It is therefore possible that further
hyperparameter tuning and more epochs for ConvMixers could close the gap between the two
architectures for large patches, e.g., p = 16."

However, k = 3 is substantially faster than k = 9 for spatial-domain convolution; we speculate

they would allow the mixing of distant spatial information similarly to unconstrained MLPs or self-
attention layers. We tried to investigate the eﬀect of kernel size on CIFAR-10: we ﬁxed the model to
be a ConvMixer-256/8, and increased the kernel size by 2s from 3 to 15."

with more training iterations or more regularization, the eﬀect of larger kernels would be more
pronounced. Nonetheless, we concluded that ConvMixers beneﬁt from larger-than-usual kernels,
and thus used kernel sizes 7 or 9 in most of our later experiments."
REFERENCES,0.6936170212765957,"It is conventional wisdom that large-kernel convolutions can be “decomposed” into stacked small-
kernel convolutions with activations between them, and it is therefore standard practice to use k = 3
convolutions, stacking more of them to increase the receptive ﬁeld size with additional beneﬁts
from nonlinearities. This raises a question: is the beneﬁt of larger kernels in ConvMixer actually
better than simply increasing the depth with small kernels? First, we note that deeper networks are
generally harder to train, so by increasing the kernel size independently of the depth, we may recover
some of the beneﬁts of depth without making it harder for signals to “propagate back” through the
network. To test this, we trained a ConvMixer-256/10 with k = 3 (698K parameters) in the same
setting as a ConvMixer-256/8 with k = 9 (707K parameters), i.e., we increased depth in a small-
kernel model to roughly match the parameters of a large-kernel model. The ConvMixer-256/10
achieved 94.29% accuracy (1.5% less), which provides more evidence for the importance of larger
kernels in ConvMixers. Next, instead of ﬁxing the parameter budget, we tripled the depth (using the
intuition that 3 stacked k = 3 convolutions have the receptive ﬁeld of a k = 9 convolution), giving a
ConvMixer-256/24 with 1670K parameters, and got 95.16% accuracy, i.e., still less."

Further increasing the patch size leads to rapid decreases in accuracy, with only 92.61% for p = 4."

REFERENCES,0.8425531914893617,"In Figure 4 and 5, we visualize the (complete) weights of the patch embedding layers of a ConvMixer-
1536/20 with p = 14 and a ConvMixer-768/32 with p = 7, respectively. Much like Sandler et al.
(2019), the layer consists of Gabor-like ﬁlters as well as “colorful globs” or rough edge detectors.
The ﬁlters seem to be more structured than those learned by MLP-Mixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021);
also unlike MLP-Mixer, the weights look much the same going from p = 14 to p = 7: the latter
simply looks like a downsampled version of the former. It is unclear, then, why we see such a
drop in accuracy for larger patches. However, some of the ﬁlters essentially look like noise, maybe
suggesting a need for more regularization or longer training, or even more data. Ultimately, we
cannot read too much into the learned representations here."
REFERENCES,0.8468085106382979,"In Figure 6, we plot the hidden convolutional kernels for successive layers of a ConvMixer. Ini-
tially, the kernels seem to be relatively small, but make use of their allowed full size in later layers;
there is a clear hierarchy of features as one would expect from a standard convolutional architec-
ture. Interestingly, Touvron et al. (2021a) saw a similar eﬀect for ResMLP, where earlier layers
look like small-kernel convolution, while later layers were more diﬀuse, despite these layers being
representated by an unconstrained matrix multiplication rather than convolution."
