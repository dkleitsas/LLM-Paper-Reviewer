ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0030303030303030303,"Deep learning has been widely employed in brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) to
decode a subject’s intentions based on recorded brain activities enabling direct
interaction with computers and machines. BCI systems play a crucial role in
motor rehabilitation and have recently experienced a signiﬁcant market boost as
consumer-grade products. Recent studies have shown that deep learning-based
BCIs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Failures in such systems might cause
medical misdiagnoses, physical harm, and ﬁnancial damages, hence it is of utmost
importance to analyze and understand in-depth, potential malicious attacks to
develop countermeasures. In this work, we present the ﬁrst study that analyzes
and models adversarial attacks based on physical domain constraints in EEG-
based BCIs. Speciﬁcally, we assess the robustness of EEGNet which is the
current state-of-the-art network for embedded BCIs. We propose new methods
to induce denial-of-service attacks and incorporate domain-speciﬁc insights and
constraints to accomplish two key goals: (i) create smooth adversarial attacks
that are physiologically plausible; (ii) consider the realistic case where the attack
happens at the origin of the signal acquisition and it propagates on the human head.
Our results show that EEGNet is signiﬁcantly vulnerable to adversarial attacks
with an attack success rate of more than 50%. With our work, we want to raise
awareness and incentivize future developments of proper countermeasures."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.00909090909090909,"Recent work has shown that adversarial perturbations can cause state-of-the-art (SoA) deep learning
models to misbehave in various domains including vision (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al.,
2015), NLP (Li et al., 2019a; Zhang et al., 2020), speech (Qin et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019b), and
biomedicine (Finlayson et al., 2019; Han et al., 2020). Neural networks have been applied in
brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) achieving impressive results (Lawhern et al., 2018; Dose et al.,
2018). A BCI enables direct interactions with external devices based on brain activities, typically
recorded using electroencephalographic (EEG) systems. It can provide a communication pathway
for severely paralyzed patients or assist in rehabilitation (Chaudhary et al., 2016). Besides medical
applications, recent developments in wearable devices have pushed BCIs towards consumer-grade
products to improve life quality (Aricò et al., 2020), e.g., the Interaxon Muse headband for stress
relief (Arsalan et al., 2019) or the Emotiv headset for controlling drones (Marin et al., 2020) and
ground vehicles (Zhuang et al., 2021). Safety in BCI systems is paramount (Dutta, 2020; Bernal et al.,
2021), because a failure would cause misdiagnoses, user frustration, or even danger while driving a
wheelchair or controlling a drone, causing physical and ﬁnancial damages."
INTRODUCTION,0.012121212121212121,"Zhang & Wu (2019) were the ﬁrst to show that EEG-based BCIs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks
by proposing an unsupervised fast gradient sign method (FGSM) (Goodfellow et al., 2015). More
recent work has proposed a more practical attack where a universal adversarial perturbation (UAP)
is computed once and can be applied to all EEG trials without learning it for every new input (Liu
et al., 2021). Both works assume that the acquired signals are sent to a remote compute engine, e.g.,
a computer, and the attacker can alter the signals during the transmission by attaching a “jamming”
module between the signal preprocessing step and the classiﬁer. Recent developments in smart edge
computing (Akmandor & Jha, 2018; Beach et al., 2021) eliminate the need for data transmission,
making this attack scenario inapplicable. Novel BCI solutions (Kartsch et al., 2019; Wang et al.,
2020) embed the signal processing and classiﬁcation directly at the sensor edge. A more practical"

INTRODUCTION,0.01818181818181818,"adversarial example has been identiﬁed by Meng et al. (2021). It consists of a square-shaped signal
that can be added to EEG trials before the preprocessing step. However, the attack is proposed as
a backdoor key, which means that the attacker has direct access to the training dataset and pollutes
it with adversarial examples, which is improbable if the attacker is not directly involved in the data
acquisition or in the training of the classiﬁer. Li et al. (2019b) have shown an attack scenario in the
audio domain by considering the on-board edge processing of a wake-word detection system, where
an adversarial audio trace is delivered to the environment causing denial-of-service (DoS). No similar
studies can be currently found in the BCI domain."
INTRODUCTION,0.021212121212121213,"Challenges:
Designing natural attacks and modeling its propagation.
Unlike in audio
applications where the signal can simply propagate over-the-air and is sensed by a microphone, extra
modeling is required to evaluate the signal propagation in BCIs based on the physical properties of the
biological tissues. In this work, rather than assuming a “jamming” module between the preprocessing
and the classiﬁcation steps as in related works, we consider a more realistic and practically applicable
attack scenario where the adversarial perturbations are introduced at the source of the data acquisition,
as showcased in Figure 6 in Appendix A. This can be achieved, for example, via electromagnetic
waves delivered to the environment (Dutta, 2020) or via transcranial current stimulation with electrical
current delivered directly to the scalp (Bodranghien et al., 2017; Fertonani et al., 2015), by exploiting
wearable devices, such as smart glasses or over-ear headsets (Flowneuroscience, 2021; Marin et al.,
2020). The adversarial perturbations translate into electrical signals propagating over the scalp and
are sensed by the electrodes in addition to the EEG signals."
INTRODUCTION,0.024242424242424242,"To guarantee the imperceptibility of the attacks, previous works in BCIs create perturbations that
are small in amplitude (Zhang & Wu, 2019; Jiang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021), limiting the attack
success rate (ASR). Increased perturbation’s amplitude yields higher ASR (Meng et al., 2021), but
makes the attack more easily detectable. Moreover, the generated perturbations are square-shaped,
which is implausible for biosignals. Han et al. (2020) are the ﬁrst to observe square-wave artifacts
in biosignals’ attacks and propose smooth perturbations for electrocardiograms (ECGs). No similar
works have been found for EEGs."
INTRODUCTION,0.02727272727272727,"This work: Practical attacks on BCI models. To address the above technical challenges, and
for analyzing the vulnerability of embedded BCI models in practical scenarios, we design a new
attack algorithm that generates smooth adversarial examples based on the signals’ ﬁrst derivative and
model its propagation over the scalp based on a realistic head model by taking into consideration the
attack source and the electrical and physical properties of the conducting tissues. This enables the
creation of practically effective perturbations, that can be delivered by an external device to attack
EEG-based BCIs at the source of signal acquisition. We attack the most energy-efﬁcient network that
has been embedded on microcontrollers for smart wearable BCIs called EEGNet (Lawhern et al.,
2018; Schneider et al., 2020). It is a resource-friendly convolutional neural network (CNN) and is the
SoA in terms of accuracy and energy-efﬁciency trade-off (Belwaﬁet al., 2018; Malekmohammadi
et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Schneider et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.030303030303030304,"We evaluate our methods and show experimental results on BCIs based on the motor imagery (MI)
paradigm, which is of special interest among others because it can be asynchronously self-paced
without external stimuli (Freer & Yang, 2020). By imagining the movement of different body parts,
the decoded intention is translated into control signals. It is widely applied in several BCI applications,
such as the control of wheelchairss (Yu et al., 2018), prosthetic armss (Elstob & Secco, 2016), ground
vehicles (Zhuang et al., 2021), and in communication (Brumberg et al., 2016). It has been proven
to be the most difﬁcult task to be attacked among the most common BCI paradigms (Zhang & Wu,
2019; Meng et al., 2021). We evaluate our methods by “fooling” the victim model to always predict
“rest” class. This essentially yields a DoS attack, because resting-state EEG signals are generally
interpreted as no subject’s intention decoded, i.e., no control action needs to be taken by the BCI
system (Yu et al., 2018). While for healthy subjects it might solely cause user frustration and ﬁnancial
losses, for severely paralyzed patients it can lead to loss of communication and independence. We
generalize our methodology to an other MI task of BCI Competition IV-2a dataset and believe that it
can be easily adapted to other BCI paradigms."

The projected gradient descent (PGD) (Madry et al., 2018) is a variant of the basic iterative

perturbation by iteratively taking small steps of size α in the gradient’s direction and projecting the
resulting perturbation back to the sample’s neighborhood after each iteration. We randomly initialize
the attack inside the L∞ball of radius ϵ and update the attack Vt+1 for any iteration t with
Vt+1 = clipϵ (Vt −α · sign (∇Vl (X + Vt, yt))) ,
(7)
where α is a step size smaller than ϵ which decays linearly with each iteration and the function
clipϵ (·) clips the signal at the maximum desired amplitude ϵ."

The perturbation is emitted by a smart, adversarial device placed close to the ear, e.g., a smart glass or
in-ear headphones, and is propagated to the individual EEG electrodes over the scalp’s skin. As can
be experimentally observed on measured EEG traces (Merlet et al., 2013; Sazgar & Young, 2019),
the same electrical source, e.g., electrocardiographic activities, is sensed by each EEG electrode with
different degrees of attenuation and delay. We present a practical propagation model that determines
the magnitude and delay for every individual electrode based on the distance along the scalp to the
adversarial device. The perturbation is trained end-to-end to fool the classiﬁer to always output “rest,”
hence DoS, while respecting the spatial model and the amplitude constraints to remain imperceptible."

propose data-driven measures for quantifying the naturalism of an attack. We compute either the

original EEG, and average the values over the Nch channels and over the samples in the dataset."

device placed on the left side of the subject or close to the left ear. More speciﬁcally, in this study, we
assume that the EEG electrode at the position T9 according to the international 10-10 system (Sch),
which is the closest to the left ear, senses the largest perturbation. The signal subsequently propagates
over the skin to each electrode, which results in an individual magnitude and delay depending on

A large λm represents cases with large attenuation and limited propagation, i.e., a limited set of
neighboring electrodes sense the perturbation. Conversely, a small λm covers cases with lower

SPATIAL PROPAGATION MODEL,0.16363636363636364,"Delay.
The propagation of a signal on the head surface yields a position-dependent phase angle or
delay, as shown by experimental measurements of related studies (Plutchik & Hirsch, 1963; Qiao
et al., 1994). The delay stems from a combination of resistive and capacitive components that are
encountered during the propagation of the signal, which can be modeled as an RC-circuit with
resistance R, capacity C, and time constant τ = R · C that relates to the group delay. Speciﬁcally,
the contacts between the electrodes and the skin are predominantly capacitive whereas the skin itself
is both resistive and capacitive (Kim et al., 2010). As explained in the previous part, an increasing
distance between the attacker and the target electrode yields a larger resistance R. As a result, the
time constant τ and the delay increase too."

which conducted human skin impedance and phase angle measurements by placing electrodes at
an approximate distance of 10 cm and applying voltages with frequencies in the range 2–1000 Hz.
When assuming a linear frequency-phase relation in low-frequency region (Qiao et al., 1994), one
can derive the group delay to be 2.8 ms when considering a measured angle of 10◦at 10 Hz. As those
measurements were conducted for only one distance, we extrapolate the delay for the remaining
distances using a rectiﬁed linear model:"

but also on other parameters such as the electrode-to-skin contact, the humidity of the skin, etc. To
this end, we evaluate the propagation of the attack with different characteristic delay parameters
λd ∈[0.1, 0.563] s/m. With λd = 0.1 we cover the cases where very little delay happens, while the
largest considered λd = 0.563 s/m yields a maximum delay of 0.1 s at the farthest electrode T10,
which is in alignment with the observed EEG measurements (Merlet et al., 2013; Sazgar & Young,

to a delay of 0.053 ms at T10."

Alternatively, we compute the perturbation using PGD with G=10 iterations, where each iteration

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS,0.4121212121212121,"Physiologically plausible attacks.
We ﬁrst analyze the instance-based attacks without considering
the propagation model (Case 1), depicted in Figure 1. We compare our methods against random
noise with amplitude ϵ as in (Zhang & Wu, 2019), FGSM that is the same as in (Zhang & Wu, 2019)
with targeted scenario, and a UAP designed speciﬁcally for EEG (Liu et al., 2021). For both FGSM
and PGD, the ASR increases together with the maximum amplitude ϵ of the perturbation. They
always outperform the random noise, with PGD performing slightly better than FGSM. They reach
the maximum ASR of 99.97% with 10mV. The post-attack classiﬁcation accuracy drops from 74.78%
to 48% for a perturbation amplitude of 2 mV and to 33% for 10 mV and higher amplitudes. Figure 2a
shows the signals of a successful attack using PGD. The adversarial perturbation has a square-
wave form which negatively affects the natural shape of the EEG signal. By adding the proposed
derivative term, the square-wave artifacts are signiﬁcantly reduced (2b), making the perturbation more"

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS,0.41818181818181815,"physiologically plausible. When comparing the power spectral density of the original and attacked
signals, the attacked signal designed without derivative presents large components in low frequencies,
making it more easily detectable. Whereas the attack with derivative loss better resembles the power
spectral density of the original signal (see Appendix D). Moreover, the introduction of the derivative
term does not degrade the ASR (Figure 1). The quantitative measures between the original and the
adversarial samples in Table 1 demonstrate that our proposed method with derivative term generates
adversarial samples that are more similar to the original EEG, allowing them to remain imperceptible
even with high ϵ (Appendix D). We reproduce the attacks using a Gaussian kernel as in (Han et al.,
2020). After tuning the kernel size and variance of the Gaussian kernel, the method could not improve
the plausibility metrics. The inferior performance of the Gaussian kernel could stem from the different
nature of the signal: it was originally designed for ECGs which have a pseudo-periodic structure."
EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS,0.4212121212121212,"We extend the application of the derivative term to the UAP attack, while still not considering the
propagation model (Case 1). Figure 1 shows a comparison in performance for different values of ϵ.
The saturation in ASR is reached with higher ϵ, i.e., 99.94% with 50mV. This is expected since the
UAP is a more difﬁcult attack where a single set of perturbations per EEG channel is generated for
all the test samples. Likewise in PGD, the ASR does not drop with the addition of the derivative term.
We reproduce the UAP proposed by (Liu et al., 2021). Our UAP consistently reaches higher ASR."
EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS,0.42424242424242425,"Spatial Propagation.
Finally, we introduce the spatial constraints in the signal propagation over the
scalp (Case 2). We consider 9 different scenarios by combining 3 realistic attenuation conﬁgurations
λm ∈{1, 5, 15} with 3 delay conﬁgurations λd ∈{0.1, 0.3, 0.563}, which capture the range
described in Section 3.2. For evaluating the highest achievable attack efﬁciency, we test a scenario
where the attacker is assumed to know the propagation model: the adversarial perturbation is generated
and evaluated on ﬁxed spatial parameters λm and λd, shown in Figure 4, where the ASR reaches up
to 69.2% with PGD and 45.6% with UAP at 50mV. Figure 3 depicts an example of a successful attack
with the highest perturbation amplitude. The introduction of the spatial constraints makes the attack
problem harder yielding seldom square distortions. However, the resulting EEG signals still resemble
physiological random processes typical of EEGs. Next, we ablate the spatial constraints during
generation and test the resulting perturbations on the 9 above-mentioned scenarios (Case 3). The
ASR drops signiﬁcantly, especially for λm=5 and λm=15 where the attenuation of the perturbation
over the scalp is greater (see Figure 7), and with the global UAP attack, where the attacker does not
have access to the attacked EEG signals."
EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS,0.42727272727272725,"Our spatial propagation models allows us to identify the vulnerability of the individual EEG channels.
Figure 5 shows the ASR when initiating an attack from a speciﬁc channel (T9, T10, etc.) and
propagating it to the rest of the head. In the case with the greatest attenuation (λm=15) we ﬁnd the
maximum ASR at the electrode Cz between the regions of the electrodes C3 and C4, which are the
most relevant ones for MI of the left and right hand tasks (Pfurtscheller & Lopes da Silva, 1999). We
compute the pre- and post-attack confusion matrices for attacks from T9 and T10 (see Appendix E).
When the attack propagates from the left side (T9), more samples with ground-truth label “right” can
be fooled to “rest”, while the attacks from the right side (T10) are more effective “left” labels."
EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS,0.4303030303030303,"Overall, our methods successfully generates perturbations resembling natural noise in EEGs, that can
be added at the source of the signal acquisition and are propagated over the scalp, creating attacked
signals that are physiologically plausible. Similar results have been observed on the BCI Competition
IV-2a dataset, shown in Appendix C."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.43636363636363634,"With the incentive of improving security in BCIs, in this work, we demonstrated that DoS attacks
are feasible and effective despite physical domain constraints. Experimental results reveal potential
risks of realistic attacks on smart wearable BCIs and incentivize the need for future development of
defense mechanisms while designing deep learning models to be embedded in smart wearable BCIs.
Our detailed analysis on each EEG channel shows that special attention has to be paid, combined
with the ﬁndings in neuroscience, to the brain regions that are found responsible for a speciﬁc task.
In future work, the proposed attacks can cover uncertainty in the propagation model and the timing of
the MI activity. Moreover, hardware implementations of such attacks can be created to evaluate the
proposed methods in real-world, with the ultimate goal of developing effective countermeasures."

While this improves the system security to a certain extend, with this work we have shown that it is

PLAUSIBILITY OF ATTACKS"
REFERENCES,0.693939393939394,"This section provides power spectral density plots of original signals and attacked signals with and
without the derivative loss term, shown in Figure 10. The power spectral density is determined
by computing the magnitude squared Fast Fourier Transform of the signals that were illustrated in
Figure 2. The attack designed with the derivative loss term has a similar distribution as the original
signal, where as the attack without derivative shows large contributions in the low frequency domain
(<5 Hz), which were not present in the original signal. These low-frequency components stem from
the square-wave shaped attack and can be used as a way to detect the attack; hence, this attack cannot
be considered imperceptible."
REFERENCES,0.696969696969697,"Moreover, Figure 13 shows the attacks with and without derivative loss term with increasing maximum
amplitude ϵ. We can see that for low amplitudes (1 mV and 5 mV) the generated attacks with and
without derivative still look like EEGs. At 10 mV, the attack generated without derivative presents
minor square-wave artifacts, which could be still imperceptible to a non-expert. With 25 mV and
50 mV, the ones generated without derivative have strong and perceptible square-wave displacements,
while the ones generated with our proposed method can still be mistaken as real EEG signals. While
with the instance-based attacks, it is not necessary to have more than 10 mV to get a very high ASR
(see Figure 1), with the universal attacks and physical constraints, the ASR increases with increasing
perturbation amplitude (see Figure 4)."
REFERENCES,0.7,"The same observations can be drawn from the plausibility metrics, which have been proposed for the
ﬁrst time in this paper to assess quantitatively the EEG attacks. For example, looking at the cosine
similarity (γ) in Table 1, without the derivative loss term, γ drops to 97.99% with ϵ = 5mV, whereas,
with the derivative, γ drops to about the same value of 97.47% with ϵ = 10 mV, yielding an increase
in ASR from 85% (5 mV) to 99% (10 mV) shown in Figure 1 with PGD."
