ABSTRACT,0.0016260162601626016,"Appropriate spatiotemporal modelling of wildfire activity is crucial for its prediction and risk
management. Here, we focus on wildfire risk in the Aquitaine region in the Southwest of France
and its projection under climate change. We study whether wildfire risk could further increase
under climate change in this specific region, which does not lie in the historical core area of
wildfires in Southeastern France, corresponding to the Southeast. For this purpose, we consider
a marked spatiotemporal point process, a flexible model for occurrences and magnitudes of such
environmental risks, where the magnitudes are defined as the burnt areas. The model is first
calibrated using 14 years of past observation data of wildfire occurrences and weather variables,
and then applied for projection of climate-change impacts using simulations of numerical climate
models until 2100 as new inputs. We work within the framework of a spatiotemporal Bayesian
hierarchical model, and we present the workflow of its implementation for a large dataset at
daily resolution for 8km-pixels using the INLA-SPDE approach. The assessment of the posterior
distributions shows a satisfactory fit of the model for the observation period. We stochastically
simulate projections of future wildfire activity by combining climate model output with posterior
simulations of model parameters. Depending on climate models, spline-smoothed projections
indicate low to moderate increase of wildfire activity under climate change. The increase is
weaker than in the historical core area, which we attribute to different weather conditions
(oceanic versus Mediterranean). Besides providing a relevant case study of environmental risk
modelling, this paper is also intended to provide a full workflow for implementing the Bayesian
estimation of marked log-Gaussian Cox processes using the R-INLA package of the R statistical
software."
