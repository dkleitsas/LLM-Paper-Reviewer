ABSTRACT,0.006024096385542169,"Owing to the beneﬁts for customers (lower prices), drivers (higher revenues), ag-
gregation companies (higher revenues) and the environment (fewer vehicles), on-
demand ride pooling (e.g., Uber pool, Grab Share) has become quite popular. The
signiﬁcant computational complexity of matching vehicles to combinations of re-
quests has meant that traditional ride pooling approaches are myopic in that they
do not consider the impact of current matches on future value for vehicles/drivers.
Recently, Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming (NeurADP) has employed
value decomposition with Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) to outper-
form leading approaches by considering the impact of an individual agent’s (vehi-
cle) chosen actions on the future value of that agent. However, in order to ensure
scalability and facilitate city-scale ride pooling, NeurADP completely ignores the
impact of other agents actions on individual agent/vehicle value. As demonstrated
in our experimental results, ignoring the impact of other agents actions on indi-
vidual value can have a signiﬁcant impact on the overall performance when there
is increased competition among vehicles for demand. Our key contribution is a
novel mechanism based on computing conditional expectations through joint con-
ditional probabilities for capturing dependencies on other agents actions without
increasing the complexity of training or decision making. We show that our new
approach, Conditional Expectation based Value Decomposition (CEVD) outper-
forms NeurADP by up to 9.76% in terms of overall requests served, which is a
signiﬁcant improvement on a city wide benchmark taxi dataset."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.018072289156626505,"Taxi/car on Demand (ToD) services (e.g., UberX, Lyft, Grab) not only provide a comfortable means
of transport for customers, but also are good for the environment by enabling sharing of vehicles over
time (while being used to serve one request at any one point in time). A further improvement of ToD
is on-demand ride pooling (e.g., UberPool, LyftLine, GrabShare etc.), where vehicles are shared not
only over time but also in space (on the taxi/car). On-demand ride pooling reduces the number
of vehicles required, thereby reducing emissions and trafﬁc congestion compared to Taxi/car on-
Demand (ToD) services. This is achieved while providing beneﬁts to all the stakeholders involved:
(a) Individual passengers have reduced costs due to sharing of space; (b) Drivers make more money
per trip as multiple passengers (or passenger groups) are present; (c) For the aggregation company
more customer requests can be satisﬁed with the same number of vehicles."
INTRODUCTION,0.024096385542168676,"In this paper, we focus on this on-demand ride pooling problem at city scale, referred to as Ride-
Pool Matching Problem (RMP) [Alonso-Mora et al. (2017); Bei & Zhang (2018); Lowalekar et al.
(2019)]. The goal in an RMP is to assign combinations of user requests to vehicles (of arbitrary
capacity) online such that quality constraints (e.g., delay in reaching destination due to sharing is not
more than 10 minutes) and matching constraints (one request can be assigned at most one vehicle,
one vehicle must be assigned at most one request combination) are satisﬁed while maximizing an
overall objective (e.g., number of requests, revenue). Unlike the ToD problem that requires solving a
bipartite matching problem between vehicles and customers, RMP requires effective matching on a
tripartite graph of requests, trips (combinations of requests) and vehicles. This matching on tripartite
graph signiﬁcantly increases the complexity of solving RMP online, especially at city scale where"

INTRODUCTION,0.03614457831325301,"there are hundreds or thousands of vehicles, hundreds of requests arriving every minute and request
combinations have to be computed for each vehicle."
INTRODUCTION,0.04216867469879518,"Due to this complexity and the need to make decisions online, most existing work related to solving
RMP has focused on computing best greedy assignments [Ma et al. (2013); Tong et al. (2018); Huang
et al. (2014); Lowalekar et al. (2019); Alonso-Mora et al. (2017)]. While these scale well, they are
myopic and, as a result, do not consider the impact of a given assignment on future assignments.
The closest works of relevance to this paper are by Shah et al. [Shah et al. (2020)] and Lowalekar
et al. [Lowalekar et al. (2021)]. We speciﬁcally focus on the work by Shah et al., as it has the best
performance, while being scalable. That work considers future impact of current assignment from
an individual agents’ perspective without sacriﬁcing on scalability (to city scale). However, a key
limitation of that work is that they do not consider the impact of other agents (vehicles) actions on
an agents’(vehicle) future impact, which as we demonstrate in our experiments can have a major
effect (primarily because vehicles are competing for the common demand)."
INTRODUCTION,0.04819277108433735,"To that end, we develop a conditional expectation based value decomposition approach that not only
considers future impact of current assignments but also of other agents state and actions through the
use of conditional probabilities and tighter estimates of individual impact. Due to these conditional
probability based tighter estimates of individual value functions, we can scale the work by Guestrin
et al. [Guestrin & Parr (2002)] and Li et al. [Li & Kochenderfer (2021)] to solve problems with no
explicit coordination graphs and hundreds/thousands of homogeneous agents. Unlike value decom-
position approaches [Rashid & Whiteson (2018); Sunehag & Graepel (2018)] developed for solving
cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with tens of agents and under central-
ized training and decentralized execution set up, we focus on problems with hundreds or thousands
of agents with centralized training and centralized execution (e.g., Uber, Lyft, Grab)."
INTRODUCTION,0.05421686746987952,"In this application domain of taxi on demand services, where improving 0.5%-1% is a major achieve-
ment [Lin et al. (2018)], we demonstrate that our approach easily outperforms the existing best ap-

BACKGROUND,0.28313253012048195,"The advantage of this two step value estimation is that the maximization problem in Equation 4
can be solved using a Integer Linear Program (ILP) with matching constraints indicated in ex-
pression 2. Step D of Figure 1) provides this aspect of the overall algorithm. The value function
approximation around post-decision state, V a(sa
t ) is a neural network and is updated (Step E of
Figure 1) by stepping forward through time using sample realizations of exogenous information
(i.e. demand observed in data). However, as we describe next, maintaining a joint value function
is not scalable and hence we decompose and maintain individual value functions.
Decomposing Joint Value (DJV): Non-linear value functions, unlike their linear counterparts,
cannot be directly integrated into the ILP mentioned above. One way to incorporate them is
to evaluate the value function for all possible post-decision states and then add these values
as constants. However, the number of post-decision states is exponential in the number of re-
sources/vehicles.
[Shah et al. (2020)] introduced a two-step decomposition of the joint value function that converts
it into a linear combination over individual value functions associated with each vehicle. In the
ﬁrst step, following [Russell & Zimdars (2003)], the joint value function is written as the sum
over individual value functions : V (sa

In the second step, the individual vehicles’ value functions are approximated. They assumed
that the long-term expected reward of a given vehicle is not signiﬁcantly affected by the speciﬁc
actions another vehicle makes in the current decision epoch and thereby completely neglect the
impact of the actions taken by other vehicles at the current time step. Thus they model the value

BACKGROUND,0.3313253012048193,"One of the fundamental drawbacks in NeurADP is that each agent/vehicle2 to a large extent is kept
in oblivion about the values of the feasible actions for other agents/vehicles. Since our problem
execution (assignment of requests to agents) is centralized, this independence of individual agents
(as shown in experimental results) leads to sub-optimal actions for the entire system."
BACKGROUND,0.3373493975903614,"While there are dependencies between agents, not all agents are dependent on each other and one

on agent i’s value. Such an approach is scalable if there are a few agents. However, when considering
thousands of agents and a central ILP which requires values for all different joint action pairs,
there is a combinatorial explosion making the model non deployable in real time. To put things
into perspective, assuming each agent has |A| feasible actions (request combinations) and there
are N(typically 1000) agents, the number of value evaluations jumps from N · |A| in DJV to
N · |A|2 while using a coordination graph. It should be further noted the A corresponds to request
combinations and hence can increase combinatorially."

well known Expectation Maximization algorithm [Dempster (1977)] for identifying missing data,
the likelihood is calculated by introducing a conditional probability of unknown data given known
data. In a similar vein, our method to deal with the unknown impact of other agents is by considering
conditional probability of agent j taking action aj given agent i takes action ai in state s. This will

NO EXPLICIT/STATIC COORDINATION GRAPH"
BACKGROUND,0.39759036144578314,"While it is clear that agents that are very far apart will not have any dependency, there is no explicit
coordination graph that is present in RMP. However, RMP has two characteristics that make it easier
to identify neighbouring agents for any given agent:
• Agents that are nearby spatially are more probable to compete over the same set of requests and
hence would have a dependency.
• Agents/vehicles do not have identity, i.e., they are all homogenous.
Due to these characteristics, we can cluster the intersections in the road network (to capture spatial
dependencies) and consider agents at a time step in an intersection cluster as neighboring agents.
Due to homogeneity of agents, the only aspect of importance is whether there are agents (and not
which speciﬁc agents) competing for the same requests. Unlike previous works, the coordination
graph keeps changing at each time step, as agents move between clusters. At time t, an agent placed
at an intersection belonging to cluster Ck will coordinate with all other agents in cluster Ck."

found that NeurADP values can have signiﬁcant errors compared to the discounted future rewards

BACKGROUND,0.6807228915662651,"• Enforcing values to be positive : NeurADP models the value function as a shared parameter Neu-

(MLP) having range as the entire real line. However, as our objective function (number of re-
quests served) is non-negative, negative values (admissible by NeurADP) are not reasonable. We
thus use a SoftPlus activation after the ﬁnal MLP to ensure that the computed values are strictly
positive.

EXPERIMENTS"
EXPERIMENTS,0.7530120481927711,"The goal of the experiments is to compare the performance of our approach CEVD to Neu-
rADP[Shah et al. (2020)](henceforth referred to as baseline), which is the current best approach
for solving the RMP. We make this comparison on a real-world dataset [NYYellowTaxi (2016)]
across different RMP parameter settings. We quantitatively justify our performance by comparing
the service rate, i.e., the percentage improvement on the total requests served. We vary the following
parameters: the maximum allowed waiting time τ from 90 seconds to 150 seconds, the number of
vehicles |R| from 500 to 1000 and the capacity C from 4 to 5. The value of maximum allowable
detour delay λ is taken as 2 ∗τ. The decision epoch duration ∆is taken as 60 seconds."
EXPERIMENTS,0.7590361445783133,"Setup: We perform our experiments on the demand distribution from the publicly available New
York Yellow Taxi Dataset [NYYellowTaxi (2016)]. The experimental setup is similar to the setup
used by [Shah et al. (2020)]. Street intersections are used as the set of locations L. They are
identiﬁed by taking the street network of the city from openstreetmap using osmnx with ’drive’
network type [Boeing (2017)]. Nodes that do not have outgoing edges are removed, i.e., we take
the largest strongly connected component of the network. The resulting network has 4373 locations
(street intersections) and 9540 edges. The travel time on each road segment of the street network
is taken as the daily mean travel time estimate computed using the method proposed in [Santi et al.
(2014)]. We further cluster these intersections L into K clusters using K-Means Clustering based
on the average travel times between different intersections. We choose the value of K based on the
number of vehicles. K is chosen to be 100,150 and 200 for 500,750 and 1000 vehicles respectively.
Similar to previous work, we only consider the street network of Manhattan as a majority (∼75%)
of requests have both pickup and drop-off locations within it. The dataset contains data about past
customer requests for taxis at different times of the day and different days of the week. From
this dataset, we take the following ﬁelds: (1) Pickup and drop-off locations (latitude and longitude
coordinates) - These locations are mapped to the nearest street intersection. (2) Pickup time - This
time is converted to appropriate decision epoch based on the value of ∆. The dataset contains on an
average 322714 requests in a day (on weekdays) and 19820 requests during peak hour."
EXPERIMENTS,0.7650602409638554,"We evaluate the approaches over 24 hours on different days starting at midnight and take the average
value over 5 weekdays (4 - 8 April 2016) by running them with a single instance of initial random
location of taxis 4. CEVD is trained using the data for 8 weekdays (23 March - 1 April 2016) and
it is validated on 22 March 2016. For the experimental analysis, we consider that all vehicles have
identical capacities."
EXPERIMENTS,0.7710843373493976,"Results :
We compare CEVD to NeurADP (referred to as baseline). Table 1 gives a detailed
performance analysis for the service rates of CEVD and baseline. Here are some key observations:
Effect of changing tolerance to delay, τ: CEVD obtains a 9.37% improvement over the baseline
approach for τ = 90 seconds. The difference between the baseline and CEVD decreases as τ
increases. The lower value of τ makes it difﬁcult for vehicles to accept new requests while satisfying
the constraints for already accepted requests. The neighbouring vehicles’ interactions in CEVD
prevents a vehicle from picking up requests it values highly however which would have been more
suitable given the delay constraints for some other vehicle and instead picks up requests which it
might value less but still is feasible. Thus the overall requests served increases.
Effect of changing the capacity, C : CEVD obtains a 9.76% gain over baseline for capacity 5. The"

EXPERIMENTS,0.8132530120481928,Table 1: Detailed Quantitative Results
EXPERIMENTS,0.8192771084337349,"Figure 4: This graph compares the number of requests served as a function of time. The bold lines
represent a moving average for different conﬁgurations averaged over requests from 4-8 April 2016."
EXPERIMENTS,0.8253012048192772,"difference between the baseline and CEVD increases as the capacity increases as for higher capacity
vehicles, there is a larger scope for improvement if vehicles cooperate well.
Effect of changing the number of vehicles, |R|: CEVD obtains a 9.37% improvement over the
baseline for capacity |R| = 500. The difference between the baseline and CEVD decreases as the
number of vehicles increase as in the presence of a large number of vehicles, there will always be a
vehicle that can serve the request. As a result, the quality of assignments plays a smaller role."
EXPERIMENTS,0.8313253012048193,"We further analyse the improvements obtained by CEVD over baseline by comparing the number of
requests served by both approaches at each decision epoch throughout the day. Figure 4 shows the
number of requests served by the baseline and CEVD at different decision epochs5. As shown in the
ﬁgure, initially at night time when the demand is low both approaches serve all available demand.
During the transition period from low demand to high demand period, the baseline algorithm starts
to choose suboptimal actions without considering the impact of each vehicle’s action on the whole
system while CEVD is able to capitalize on the joint action values and serve much more requests
than the baseline."
EXPERIMENTS,0.8373493975903614,"The approach can be executed in real-time settings. The average time taken to compute each batch
assignment using CEVD is less than 60 seconds (for all cases) 6. These results indicate that using
our approach can help ride-pooling platforms to better meet customer demand."
CONCLUSION,0.8433734939759037,"6
CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.8493975903614458,"Due to the matching required on a tri-partite graph between user requests, trips (combination of
user requests) and vehicles, on-demand ride pooling is challenging. Improving on existing methods,
we provide a scalable novel value decomposition method based on conditional probabilities, where
individual value is not only able to consider future impact of current matches but also impact on other
agent values. This new approach is able to outperform the best existing method in all settings of the
benchmark taxi data set employed for on-demand ride pooling by margins of up to 9.79%. To put
this result in perspective, typically, an improvement of 1% is considered a signiﬁcant improvement
on ToD for an entire city [Xu et al. (2018); Lowalekar et al. (2019)]."
