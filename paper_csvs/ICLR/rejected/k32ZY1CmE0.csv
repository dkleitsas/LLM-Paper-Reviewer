ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0013089005235602095,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are wide-spread machine learning tools for
modeling sequential and time series data. They are notoriously hard to train be-
cause their loss gradients backpropagated in time tend to saturate or diverge during
training. This is known as the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. Previ-
ous solutions to this issue either built on rather complicated, purpose-engineered
architectures with gated memory buffers, or - more recently - imposed constraints
that ensure convergence to a fixed point or restrict (the eigenspectrum of) the re-
currence matrix. Such constraints, however, convey severe limitations on the ex-
pressivity of the RNN. Essential intrinsic dynamics such as multistability or chaos
are disabled. This is inherently at disaccord with the chaotic nature of many, if
not most, time series encountered in nature and society. Here we offer a compre-
hensive theoretical treatment of this problem by relating the loss gradients during
RNN training to the Lyapunov spectrum of RNN-generated orbits. We mathe-
matically prove that RNNs producing stable equilibrium or cyclic behavior have
bounded gradients, whereas the gradients of RNNs with chaotic dynamics always
diverge. Based on these analyses and insights, we adapt the old idea of teacher
forcing to yield an effective yet simple training technique for chaotic data, and
offer guidance on how to choose relevant hyperparameters according to the Lya-
punov spectrum."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.003926701570680628,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used across various fields in engineering and science
for learning sequential tasks or modeling and predicting time series (Lipton et al., 2015). Yet, they
struggle when long-term temporal dependencies, very slow, or hugely varying time scales are in-
volved (Hochreiter, 1991; Bengio et al., 1994; Schmidt et al., 2021; Li et al., 2018; Rusch & Mishra,
2021a). Time series or sequential data with such properties are, however, very common in fields
like climate physics (Thomson, 1990), neuroscience (Fusi et al., 2007; Russo & Durstewitz, 2017),
ecology (Turchin & Taylor, 1992), or language processing (Cho et al., 2014b). Training RNNs on
such data is hard because the loss gradients backpropagated in time easily saturate or diverge in this
process. This is commonly referred to as the exploding and vanishing gradient problem (EVGP)
(Hochreiter, 1991; Bengio et al., 1994; Pascanu et al., 2013)."
INTRODUCTION,0.005235602094240838,"One solution to the EVGP is based on specifically designed RNN architectures with gating mecha-
nisms, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) or gated recur-
rent units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014a). These architectures allow states at earlier time steps to more
easily influence activity much later through a kind of protected memory buffer, thus alleviating the
EVGP by structural design. In practice, such models need to be backed up by further techniques
like gradient clipping to keep the gradients in check (Pascanu et al., 2013). The relatively complex
architectural design of these networks impedes their mathematical analysis and requires reverse en-
gineering after training (Maheswaranathan et al., 2019; Monfared & Durstewitz, 2020a;b; Schmidt
et al., 2021). Partly to forego these complications, a variety of other solutions has been proposed re-
cently, imposing restrictions on the recurrence matrix to bound the gradients (Arjovsky et al., 2016;
Chang et al., 2019), or enforcing global stability by design or regularization (Erichson et al., 2021;
Kolter & Manek, 2019). Often these procedures dramatically curtail the expressivity of the RNN
(Kerg et al., 2019; Orhan & Pitkow, 2020; Schmidt et al., 2021); in particular, they rule out chaotic
dynamics (see further discussion below)."

INTRODUCTION,0.007853403141361256,"This is at odds with the plethora of chaotic phenomena in nature, engineering, and society. Chaotic
dynamics are commonplace, almost default in any complex physical or biological system. This in-
cludes scientific areas as diverse as neuroscience (Durstewitz & Gabriel, 2007; van Vreeswijk &
Sompolinsky, 1996), physiology (Kesmia et al., 2020), geophysics (Sivakumar, 2004), climate sys-
tems (Tziperman et al., 1997), astrophysics (Laskar & Robutel, 1993), ecology (Duarte et al., 2010),
chemical reactions (Field & Gy¨orgyi, 1993), cell (Olsen & Degn, 1977) or population (May, 1987)
biology. Chaotic phenomena are also crucial for the understanding of societal and epidemiologi-
cal processes, such as the spread of diseases (Mangiarotti et al., 2020), or in economics (Faggini,
2014). They are further relevant in purely technical contexts such as electrical engineering (Tchit-
nga et al., 2019; Kamdjeu Kengne et al., 2021) or laser optics (Kantz et al., 1993). They have
even been suggested to play an up to now largely neglected, but potentially very significant role
in speech recognition (Sabanal & Nakagawa, 1996) and natural language processing (Inoue et al.,
2021). Hence, in almost any practical setting, chaotic phenomena abound. They cannot, in general,
be ignored when devising RNN training algorithms."
INTRODUCTION,0.009162303664921465,"Here we offer a comprehensive theoretical treatment of the relation between RNN dynamics and the
behavior of the loss gradients during training. We find a close connection between an RNN’s loss
gradients and the largest Lyapunov exponent of its freely generated orbits. We mathematically prove
that RNNs producing stable fixed point or cyclic behavior have bounded gradients. Crucially, how-
ever, the loss gradients of RNNs producing chaotic dynamics always diverge. Hence, the chaotic
nature of many time series data induces a principle problem, and, despite significant efforts in the
past to solve the EVGP, training RNNs on such data remains an open issue. We illustrate the impli-
cations of our theory for RNN training on several simulated and empirical chaotic time series, and
adapt the old idea of sparsely forced BPTT as a simple yet effective remedy that enables to learn the
underlying dynamics despite exploding gradients."

RELATED WORKS,0.011780104712041885,"Exploding and vanishing gradients. While ‘classical’ remedies of the EVGP (Hochreiter, 1991; Ben-
gio et al., 1994; Pascanu et al., 2013) rest on purpose-tailored architectures with gating mechanisms,
which safeguard information flow across longer temporal distances (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber,
1997; Cho et al., 2014a), the focus has recently shifted to simpler RNNs that address the EVGP by
restricting the recurrence matrix to be orthogonal (Henaff et al., 2016; Helfrich et al., 2018; Jing
et al., 2019), unitary (Arjovsky et al., 2016), or antisymmetric (Chang et al., 2019), or by ensur-
ing globally stable fixed point solutions (Kag et al., 2020; Kag & Saligrama, 2021a), for example
through co-trained Lyapunov functions (Kolter & Manek, 2019). However, all these approaches
impose strong limitations on the dynamical repertoire of the RNN, enforcing global convergence
to fixed points or simple cycles.1 In doing so, they drastically reduce the expressiveness of these
models (Kerg et al., 2019; Orhan & Pitkow, 2020). To address this problem, Erichson et al. (2021)
somewhat relaxed the constraints on the recurrence matrix by introducing a skew-symmetric decom-
position combined with a Lipschitz condition on the activation function. Another recent approach
discretizes oscillator ODEs to arrive at a stable system of coupled (Rusch & Mishra, 2021a) or
independent (Rusch & Mishra, 2021b) oscillators which increase the RNN’s expressiveness while
bounding its gradients. By design (and as acknowledged by the authors), neither of these architec-
tures is capable of producing chaotic dynamics, however, as the underlying ODEs do not allow for
exponential divergence of close-by trajectories (a prerequisite for chaos). Given these often prin-
ciple limitations of parametrically or dynamically strongly constrained models, a fruitful direction
may be to modify the training process itself, e.g. through modified or auxiliary loss functions (Trinh
et al., 2018; Schmidt et al., 2021), or special procedures for parameter updating (Kag & Saligrama,
2021b) or loss truncation (Williams & Zipser, 1989; Menick et al., 2021). Our empirical evalu-
ation will follow up on such ideas, but also highlight that simple loss truncation, windowing, or
architectural solutions like LSTMs are not sufficient."

RELATED WORKS,0.017015706806282723,"Doya (1992), see also Goodfellow et al. (2016)) is one of the earliest techniques introduced to keep
RNN trajectories on track while training. The idea behind TF is to simply replace RNN states by
observations when available, thereby also effectively cutting off the gradients. TF essentially derives
from ideas in dynamical control theory, and adaptive schemes that increasingly hand over control to
the RNN throughout training have been devised (Abarbanel, 2013; Abarbanel et al., 2018; Bengio
et al., 2015). A related technique from the control theory literature is “multiple shooting” (Voss et al.,
2004): Here the whole observed time series is chopped into chunks, and for each chunk of trajectory
a new initial condition is estimated. Explicit constraints ensure continuity between the separate
trajectory bits during optimization. State space models and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm
became popular particularly in the 90es for uncovering the latent dynamics underlying a set of
time series observations (Ghahramani & Roweis, 1999), and remain an important tool until today
(Durstewitz, 2017; Koppe et al., 2019). Most recently, approaches based on variational inference
and the reparameterization trick (Kingma & Welling, 2014), like sequential variational autoencoders
(SVAE), gained in popularity for DS approximation (Hernandez et al., 2020). “Deterministic” RNNs
(i.e., with latent states not treated as random variables), like conventional LSTMs (Vlachas et al.,
2018), remain top choices for DS reconstruction, however."
RELATED WORKS,0.01832460732984293,"Although connections between DS ideas and loss gradients have been drawn early on (Bengio et al.,
1994), so far only particular scenarios (like fixed point attractors) have been considered. Closest
to our work is recent work by Schmidt et al. (2021), where non-divergence of loss gradients is
established when RNNs converge to fixed points or cycles. However, this was done only for the
particular class of piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs), more restrictive conditions for cycles were
imposed than assumed here, and - most importantly - the chaotic case on which we focus here was
not considered. Another recent study (Engelken et al., 2020) also points out the general connections
between Lyapunov exponents and loss gradients that we develop in sect. 3.1, but does not provide
any in-depth theoretical treatment, proofs, or empirical evaluation, as we do here. Thus, a systematic
theoretical framework that relates RNN dynamics more generally, and across a range of different
RNN architectures, to the behavior of its training gradients, is still lacking so far."

FIXED POINTS AND CYCLIC DYNAMICS"
FIXED POINTS AND CYCLIC DYNAMICS,0.05759162303664921,"Let us start by considering the simplest types of dynamics that can occur in RNNs (or any discrete-
time DS): fixed points and cycles. In fact, by far most of the literature on global stability in RNNs
and on loss gradients focused on just fixed points (Chang et al., 2019; Kolter & Manek, 2019;
Erichson et al., 2021), with only few authors who recently started to also connect cyclic behavior
to loss gradients (Schmidt et al., 2021; Rusch & Mishra, 2021a). Recall that a fixed point of a
recursive map zt = F(zt−1) is defined as a point z∗for which we have z∗= F(z∗).2 Likewise,
a k-cycle (k > 1) is a set of temporally consecutive periodic points Pk := {zt1, zt2, . . . , ztk} =
{zt1, F(zt1), . . . , F k−1(zt1)} that we obtain from recursive application of the map such that each of
the cyclic points ztr ∈Pk is a fixed point of the k times iterated map F k (with k being the smallest
positive integer for which this holds). To simplify the subsequent treatment, we will collectively
refer to fixed points and cycles as k-cycles (k ≥1). Further recall that a fixed point or k-cycle is
called stable if the maximum absolute eigenvalue of the Jacobian evaluated at that point is smaller
than 1, neutrally stable if exactly 1, and unstable otherwise. Although the results we develop in this
and the following sections will hold more widely, we will restrict our attention to recursive maps Fθ

close to any point on the torus, that is, it is dense. One important difference between quasi-periodic

TRAINING ON SYSTEMS WITH EXPLODING GRADIENTS BY SPARSE TEACHER FORCING,0.1400523560209424,"To illustrate the connections between theory and RNN training, we revive the old idea of TF
(Williams & Zipser, 1989) as a mechanism for truncating error gradients while training. However,
we would like to do this such that important information about the system dynamics does not get
lost, for which Lyapunov theory offers some guidance. Specifically, we should not force the system
back onto the true trajectory all or most of the time (as in “classical TF”), but should effectively
“re-calibrate” it only at certain time points chosen wisely according to the system’s local divergence
rates. This procedure will be referred to as sparsely forced BPTT in the following."

are included in the gradient calculation and has to be chosen with care such as to balance the effects
of exploding gradients vs. those of loosing relevant time scales and long-term dependencies. While
it is general wisdom that an optimal batch size will facilitate training, the point here is thus much

a system-dependent range for the optimal learning interval that agrees well with the predictability
time defined in eqn. (17), where estimates for the maximal Lyapunov exponent were taken from the
literature (Rosenstein et al., 1993; Gilpin, 2021). As a reference, dashed lines represent the recon-
struction performance for all architectures when trained with classical BPTT and gradient clipping.
The training procedure was the same as for sparsely forced BPTT, except that instead of supplying a
control-signal, gradients were normalized to 1 prior to each parameter update. As evidenced by the
much worse performance, gradient clipping does not effectively address the EVGP, even for LSTMs.
As further shown in Fig. 9 in Appx. A.6.4, using the optimal window length τ but resetting the ini-
tial condition to zero (instead of its control value ˜zt) for each chunk equally destroys performance.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS"
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS,0.18455497382198952,"In this paper we proved that RNN dynamics and loss gradients are intimately related for all major
types of RNNs and activation functions. If the RNN is “well behaved” in the sense that its dynamics
converges to a fixed point or cycle, loss gradients will remain bounded, and established remedies
(Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Schmidt et al., 2021) can be used to refrain them from vanishing.
However, if the dynamics are chaotic, gradients will always explode. This constitutes a principle
problem in RNN training that cannot easily be mastered through architectural design or gradient
clipping. It is furthermore a practically highly relevant one, as most time series we encounter in
nature, and many from man-made systems as well, are inherently chaotic. While we do not offer
a full solution to this problem here, we suggest it might be tackled in training by taking a system’s
local divergence rates as measured through the Lyapunov spectrum into account. Hence, rather than
conquering the EVGP by structural design or specific constraints or regularization terms, we recom-
mend to put the focus more on the training process itself. We illustrated this point empirically using
sparsely forced BPTT, a training technique that pulls trajectories back on track at times determined
by the maximal Lyapunov exponent. Doing so leads to optimal reconstruction results for a variety
of simulated and real-world benchmarks, regardless of the specific RNN architecture employed in
training. We stress that our goal above all was to provide a mathematically grounded perspective
on the problem, with the empirical section focused on elucidating the practical implications of the
theoretical results. Empirically, for instance, precise Lyapunov exponents may sometimes be hard to
obtain, although our empirical examples confirm that estimates based on log-divergence plots may
work sufficiently well."

FURTHER RESULTS AND REMARKS RELATED TO THEOREM 2"

gradients of the loss function will explode as T →∞.
Remark 5. For RNNs with ReLU activation functions there are finite compartments in the phase
space each with a different functional form. In such a case, to define the largest Lyapunov exponent
of Γ∗, in the proof of Theorem 2 we assume that Γ∗never maps to the points of the borders."

Q,0.9044502617801047,"Empirical temperature time series
This time series was recorded at the Weather Station at the
Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany, spanning the time period between 2009
and 2016, and reassembled by Franc¸ois Chollet for the book Deep Learning with Python. The data
set can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/pankrzysiu/weather-archive-jena.
To expose the underlying chaotic dynamics of the time series, trends and yearly cycles were re-
moved, and nonlinear noise-reduction was performed (using ghkss from TISEAN, see also Kantz
et al. (1993)). Fig. 4 (a) shows a snippet of the temperature data in comparison with the de-
noised time-series. High-frequency noise was further reduced through Gaussian kernel smoothing
(σ = 200), and the resulting time series was sub-sampled (every 5th data point was retained). Fig. 4
(b) clearly reveals a fractional dimension of Deff = 2.8 for the de-noised and smoothed time-series.
This strongly suggests that the dynamics governing the time series are chaotic. We created a time
delay embedding (Kantz & Schreiber, 2003) with m = 5 (estimated by the false nearest neighbor
technique, see Kennel et al. (1992)) and delay ∆t = 500 (obtained as the first minimum of the
mutual information). The first three embedding dimensions are shown in Fig. 4(c). The maximal
Lyapunov exponent of this time series was determined with lyap r from TISEAN (Hegger et al.,
1999) to be λmax = 0.016, see Fig. 3(a). This value is in close agreement with the literature (Mill´an
et al., 2010). The predictability time of this system is estimated to be τpred = 43.3."

Since in DS reconstruction we aim to capture invariant (time-

the similarity in true and RNN-reconstructed power spectra. To do so, we generate a time series
of length 100, 000 from the RNN and calculate its power spectrum using the fast Fourier transform
(scipy.fft). To reduce the influence of noise we apply Gaussian kernel smoothing and cut off
the long high-frequency tails of the spectra. The dimension-wise correlation between observed and
generated spectra are then averaged to give the PSC."

OTHER INITIALIZATION PROCEDURES: STANDARD BATCHING WITH ZERO RESETTING"

on the Lyapunov spectrum), but then simply resetting the hidden states at the beginning of each
chunk (window) to 0. Formally this would mean that we do not force the trajectory back on track as
in our approach, but instead may kick it off the track. To illustrate this, here we trained an LSTM
on chunks (windows) with a length given by the optimal τ (τopt = 30 for the Lorenz system), but
then initialized the hidden states to 0 at the beginning of each window. The performance obtained
this way is indicated by the green dashed line in Fig. 9 below."

we applied nonlinear

fractional dimension Deff = 1.8 for the de-noised and smoothed times series. We created a time
delay embedding with an embedding dimension of m = 10 and a delay time of ∆t = 500. The
maximal Lyapunov exponent for this time series was determined to be λmax = 0.007, see Fig. 11
