ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.008130081300813009,"Item representation plays an important role for recommendation, such as e-
commerce, news, video, etc. It has been used by retrieval and ranking model
to capture user-item relationship based on user behaviors. For recommendation
systems, user interaction behaviors imply single or multi interests of the user, not
only items themselves in the sequences. Existing representation learning meth-
ods mainly focus on optimizing item-based mechanism between user interaction
sequences and candidate item(especially attention mechanism, sequential mod-
eling). However, item representations learned by these methods lack modeling
mechanism to reﬂect user interests. That is, the methods may be less effective
and indirect to capture user interests. We propose a framework to learn interest-
based item representations directly by introducing user Multi Interests Capsule
Network(MICN). To make the framework model-agnostic, User Multi Interests
Capsule Network is designed as an auxiliary task to jointly learn item-based item
representations and interest-based item representations. Hence, the generic frame-
work can be easily used to improve existing recommendation models without
model redesign. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple types of bench-
marks. Furthermore, we investigate several situations on various deep neural net-
works, different length of behavior sequences and joint learning ratio of interest-
based item representations. Experiment shows a great enhancement on perfor-
mance of various recommendation models and has also validated our approach.
We expect the framework could be widely used for recommendation systems."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.024390243902439025,"With the rapid development of deep learning, great achievements have been made in recommenda-
tion, such as news recommendation, video recommendation, e-commence and advertisement. For
recommendation systems, user interaction behaviors imply single or multi interests of the user, not
only items themselves in the sequences. In general, users may have multi interests, e.g., a user inter-
acts with products from several different categories, including clothes, sports and food. The interests
lay below the interactive behaviors which increases the difﬁcult of capturing them directly."
INTRODUCTION,0.032520325203252036,"For recommendation systems, how to target different users’ interests is key object. Series of deep
learning models on click-through rate (CTR) prediction have been proposed. Wide & Deep (Cheng
et al., 2016) jointly trains wide linear models and deep neural networks to combine the beneﬁts of
memorization and generalization for recommender systems. PNN, Deep Crossing (Shan et al., 2016)
and DeepFM (Guo et al., 2017) try to extract low-order and high-order feature extraction by adopting
a product layer. DIN(Zhou et al., 2018) uses attention mechanism to increase the pooling weights of
similar items. DIEN (Zhou et al., 2019) introduces sequential model to build the sequential character
instead of using item embedding directly in DIN. DIEN extracts hidden states of GRU as attention
input and uses AUGRU to take place of traditional attention model. Generally, deep neural networks
depict user interests from previous user-item interactions by utilizing item embedding vectors."

INTRODUCTION,0.06504065040650407,"However, existing representation learning methods mainly focus on optimizing item-based mecha-
nism between user interactive behavior sequences and candidate item, therefore ignore the impacting
of label diffusing into each item in user interactive behavior sequences which weaken the intensity of
user interests in back propagation of training model. Besides, with the network layers getting deeper
and the dimension of embedding layer becoming larger, new method always need to redesign the
model architecture, bring in new dataset or other information. Hence, a method is necessary to en-
hance the model performance and could be generally used in practice without redesigning whole
model architecture or bringing extra information."

INTEREST BASED ITEM EMBEDDINGS REPRESENTATION,0.6016260162601627,"Embedding representation based on deep learning is of much concern in practice(Wang et al., 2020).
In recommendation system, each recommending model has its own generating embeddings method.
Many works introduced in Section 1 extract multi interests represented by item embeddings through
designing network structures. Further, the impact of label diffusing into each item in user interac-
tive behavior sequences weaken the intensity of user interests in back propagation of training model.
Though dynamic routing capsule network can partially settle the diffusion matter of interests, specif-
ically integrated with recommending model needing to redesign the model architecture is difﬁcult
and not generally used. Inspired by DIEN, auxiliary task play signiﬁcant role in improving model
performance. In order to refrain from redesigning the complex main task model architecture, an
auxiliary task is introduced for better item representation learning. Therefore, we propose a model
framework of user Multi Interest Capsule Network(MICN) as auxiliary task and share interest based
item embeddings with main recommendation model task which is Deep Interest Network(DIN). Ac-
cording to the Equation 7, the scaled dot product, the distance between interest and item, makes item
embedding vector is indicated by user interest capsule vectors. Besides, auxiliary task brings item
embeddings expressed by user interest capsule in main model by sharing the item embedding vector.

tween the framework we proposed and benchmark on different length of user viewed sequences.
Table 4 showed the experimental result. DIEN with MICN have better AUC result than original
DIEN model. Consequently, for long click sequences of user, user interests capsule network works
more efﬁcient and accuracy to extract diverse user interests which conducted different type of ex-
periments to verify."

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS,0.8780487804878049,"In this paper, we focus on a generic framework of interest-based item embedding representation to
enhance performance of recommendation model. A framework to learn interest-based item repre-
sentations directly by introducing user multi-interests capsule network was proposed. User multi
interest capsule network is designed as an auxiliary task to jointly learn item-based item represen-
tations and interest-based item representations. The framework can be easily generalized to rec-
ommendation model architecture without extra data or substantial change of model. Besides, the"

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS,0.8943089430894309,"framework has an effect on longer viewed sequences and more diverse interests. With experimental
result on industrial datasets, the framework of user multi interest capsule network as auxiliary task
outperforms in the terms of click-throughout rate prediction task. In the future, we will try to extend
our work to explainable recommendation of users’ interests through multi interest capsule network."
