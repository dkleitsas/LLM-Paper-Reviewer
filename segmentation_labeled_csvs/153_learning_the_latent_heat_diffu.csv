ABSTRACT,0.008264462809917356,"The excessive deposition of misfolded proteins such as amyloid-β (Aβ) protein is an aging
event underlying several neurodegenerative diseases. Mounting evidence shows that the
spreading of neuropathological burden has a strong association to the white matter tracts
in the brain which can be measured using diﬀusion-weighted imaging and tractography
technologies. Most of the previous studies analyze the dynamic progression of amyloid us-
ing cross-sectional data which is not robust to the heterogeneous Aβ dynamics across the
population. In this regard, we propose a graph neural network-based learning framework
to capture the disease-related dynamics by tracking the spreading of amyloid across brain
networks from the subject-speciﬁc longitudinal PET images. To learn from limited (2 – 3
timestamps) and noisy longitudinal data, we restrict the space of amyloid propagation pat-
terns to a latent heat diﬀusion model which is constrained by the anatomical connectivity
of the brain. Our experiments show that restricting the dynamics to be a heat diﬀusion
mechanism helps to train a robust deep neural network for predicting future time points
and classifying Alzheimer’s disease brain.

INTRODUCTION,0.01652892561983471,1. Introduction
INTRODUCTION,0.024793388429752067,"Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide into extracellular plaques is known to be a central
event in Alzheimer’s disease brain (Lue et al., 1999; Palop and Mucke, 2010; Jack et al.,
2013b; Fan et al., 2018; Canter et al., 2017). An increasing number of studies (Seeley et al.,
2009; Jonkman et al., 2020) suggest that amyloid deposition expands into areas that receive
neuronal projections from other brain regions already exhibiting Aβ, spreading between
interconnected neurons through large-scale networks. Advancement in Aβ-PET imaging
enables us to quantify the spatial distribution of amyloid in the brains of living humans,
allowing for the study of disease progression before symptoms manifest (Villemagne et al.,
2018). Raj et al. (2012) proposes a network diﬀusion model to characterize this progression
pattern as a diﬀusive mechanism mediated by the brain’s connectivity network which ﬁnds
characteristic sub-modules in Alzheimer’s (AD) brain. However, their approach doesn’t
consider misfolded protein (MP) burdens such as amyloid or tau. In this regard, Vogel"

INTRODUCTION,0.04132231404958678,"et al. (2020) proposes an epidemic spreading model based on anatomical connectivity of the
brain to explain the observed MP burdens in healthy and diseased (AD) brains. Both of
these approaches show the importance of the large-scale brain network in modeling disease
progression based on MP such as Aβ. However, these approaches use cross-sectional data
which is not suﬃcient to uncover the true dynamics of amyloid because of the subject-wise
heterogeneity across the population. Although the authors of the epidemic spreading model
reconstruct the MP burdens in a subject-speciﬁc manner, they have to tune their model for
each individual during test time which might lead to overﬁtting and potentially distort the
true dynamics.
We propose Diﬀusion u-net: a graph u-net (Gao and Ji, 2019) based architecture that
uses longitudinal data to learn the disease dynamics in a subject-wise manner. However,
the complex mechanics of Aβ through brain networks is diﬃcult to learn from a dataset
that is noisy and has limited timestamps per subject (< 3 on average). We tackle this
problem by constraining our model to learn a latent heat diﬀusion process that explains the
neurodegenerative progression by the intercellular transfer of Aβ. We assume the observed
longitudinal amyloid distributions are future instances of the heat diﬀusion mechanism
constrained by the structural brain network. This way our model learns in a subset of
possible disease processes which makes it possible to infer patterns from limited temporal
data.
Moreover, while previous approaches assume a predeﬁned set of epicenter brain
regions (For example, Vogel et al. (2020) ﬁt their model using the left and right entorhinal
cortex as the epicenters) from where Aβ spreads to other brain areas, we show our model can
ﬁnd these epicenters from higher-order dynamics of Aβ deposition. Extensive experimental
results show that our model is quite eﬀective in learning a robust embedding from only a few
time point data and outperforms more complex models in terms of future Aβ prediction,
Alzheimer’s classiﬁcation, and disease epicenter estimation."

IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.0743801652892562,2.1. Dataset
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.08264462809917356,"Our dataset consists of longitudinal amyloid data processed from 1312 subjects from Alzheimer’s
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) from ﬁve diﬀerent diagnosis group — Normal Con-
trol (CN), Signiﬁcant Memory Concern (SMC), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI),
Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). with 316, 157,
357, 260, and, 222 subjects respectively. Each of the subjects has PET images at 1-6 time
points (2.3 on average) with a 6 - 30 months gap between consecutive time points. The
PET scans are ﬁrst registered to T1-weighted MR images and then standardized uptake
values (SUV) are computed for each voxel. Region-speciﬁc SUV values are computed by
partitioning the cortical surface into 148 regions by using Destrieux atlas in FreeSurfer (De-
strieux et al., 2012) and computing the average SUV for all the voxels of that brain region.
The ratio of the SUV values (SUVR) is computed using the SUV of the cerebellum as the
reference. We then normalize the SUVR based on the batch-wise min-max normalization
approach. We compute the structural connectivity matrices from dMRI data of 103 sub-
jects using FSL’s probtrackx (Behrens et al., 2007) (two-ﬁber model, 10000 tracks per seed)
to obtain 148×148 connectivity matrices. We use the average white matter connectivity
networks from the CN group in our experiments which is more robust to spurious noises in
our data compared to subject-wise networks."

IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.19834710743801653,"Equation 4 has two unknown variables — β and ρs,0. We train Diﬀusion u-net which
consists of the following two neural network models to estimate those variables from baseline
Aβ values Φs,0.
Graph u-net: We train a graph u-net model which takes Φs,0 as inputs and predicts
it’s derivative ρs,0. The u-net architecture has a depth of 4 with graph convolution layers
of 64 units. The pooling layers in u-net select the top 50% of the ROIs based on learned
ranking.
β-net: The inter-regional amyloid transfer speed β can be aﬀected by several risk factors
of Alzheimer’s disease (Raﬀaitin et al., 2009; Solfrizzi et al., 2010; Campbell et al., 2013)
such as 1. age — amyloid progression slows down over time towards a plateau (Villemagne
et al., 2013), 2. sex — interaction between tau and amyloid is stronger in women resulting
in a higher risk of developing symptoms of the serious brain disease (Buckley et al., 2019),
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ϵ4 allele — Aβ deposition rate is higher with APOE-ϵ4 carriers
(Kanekiyo et al., 2014), and education level — people with a lower level of education
are known to be less resistant against Alzheimer’s (Ngandu et al., 2007). In this regard,
we train a multilayer perceptron with 2 hidden layers of 256 units to predict β from the
aforementioned risk factors which account for the heterogeneous dynamics of Aβ across the
population.
Finally, we propose two more models (Figure 1(b)) which account for the heterogeneity
between female and male groups in the population by learning sex-speciﬁc representations
ρF
s,0 and ρM
s,0 respectively. The two models are —
Cluster u-net: Here we aim to cluster the embedding ρs,0 based on the sex informa-
tion(Male/Female). We train a multilayer perceptron (3 hidden layers with 256 units each)
to classify ρs,0 based on sex. In this way, the u-net learns an embedding that is informative
of the group. The u-net and the classiﬁer are then jointly trained to reconstruct Φ′
s.
Adaptive u-net: We then took a diﬀerent approach based on the multi-task learning
paradigm which learns an adaptive embedding for each group. Here we consider the male
and female group as a separate task and learn separate embeddings (ρM,0, ρF,0 respectively)
for them. To do this, we use our graph u-net as a base architecture and fork two diﬀerent
branches for each of the groups. These branches consist of a multilayer perceptron with 1
hidden layer of 64 units which are trained using the data from the corresponding groups."

i.e., a higher imbalance between neighboring regions."

IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.2644628099173554,"We evaluate our method by doing a series of experiments on three diﬀerent tasks — recon-
struction, classiﬁcation, and estimation of Aβ epicenters."
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.2727272727272727,2.3.1. Reconstruction
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.2809917355371901,"We compare the accuracy of the reconstructed Aβ values from our model with the following
models:
Stationary model: We assume the Aβ values are constant, i.e, there no change in
amyloid deposition over time.
Linear model: Here we assume a linear progression of amyloid without any diﬀusion
through the structural brain network. This is equivalent to assuming constant ρs,t in Equa-
tion 3, i.e., ρs,t = ρs,0 = ms which results in Φ′
s,t = mst + Φs,0. We consider two models
in this regard — Linear-shared where ms represents the shared slope for each ROI for all
the subjects, and Linear-subject where we learn subject-speciﬁc ms from Φs,0 as a linear
combination, i.e., ms = W Φs,0. Here W is a |V|×|V| weight matrix which is learned using
stochastic gradient descent.
GRU: Here we learned the non-linear dynamics from a gated recurrent unit (GRU)
(Cho et al., 2014) based architecture instead of our heat diﬀusion equation. We use the
same graph u-net based architecture as ours to learn a hidden embedding ρs,t for each time
point t and then feed them to a GRU to predict the future amyloid depositions."

tions (Φs,0 and Φ′

v2: This model is a graph convolution based classiﬁer (GCNClassiﬁer) with 2 graph
convolutional blocks with size 64 (Kipf and Welling, 2017) followed by a multilayer percep-
tron with 3 hidden layers of size 256. This model is trained using the baseline Aβ depositions"

s,0) to minimize the cross-entropy loss between predicted and ground-truth di-
agnosis label.
v3: Unlike v2, in this model we use the longitudinal data (Φs and Φ′
s) to predict the
diagnosis label (CN/AD). First, we learn an embedding from the longitudinal data using a
recurrent neural network with 2 stacked gated recurrent units (GRU) with hidden unit size
148 and then feed this embedding through our GCNClassiﬁer.
v4: In this version, instead of using a GRU, we utilize the longitudinal data by taking
the minimum (Φ′min
s
) and maximum (Φ′max
s
) Aβ values across all the time points for each
brain region and feed them to the GCNClassiﬁer (Min-Max Classiﬁer). The input Φ′mnx
s
to the model is the concatenation of the minimum and maximum values, i.e., Φ′mnx
s
=
[Φ′min
s
, Φ′max
s
].
v5: In all the previous models, the input of the classiﬁer Φ′
s,0 comes from the pretrained
Adaptive u-net. In this model, we ﬁrst pretrain Adaptive u-net with data from all the
diagnosis groups and then jointly train this Adaptive u-net and v4 for only CN and AD
group. We minimize the sum of reconstruction loss from Equation 5 and cross-entropy loss
for joint training."
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.32231404958677684,2.3.3. Epicenter estimation
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.3305785123966942,"Aβ deposition starts at certain epicenters in the Alzheimer’s brain from where it spreads to
neighbouring brain regions. It is known that Aβ load increases almost in a linear fashion
until it plateaus exhibiting non-linear dynamics (Jack et al., 2013a; Villemagne et al., 2013)."
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.33884297520661155,"This means the epicenters should exhibit higher order dynamics (Φ1

etc.)
compared to other brain regions.
In this experiment, we use these higher order
dynamics to ﬁnd the epicenters from where the Aβ spreads to the brain. Our diﬀusion u-net
model learns to estimate a graph signal by reconstructing Φs,0 from ρs,0 using Equation 3
which enforces ρs,0 = dΦs,0"
IMPLEMENTATION/METHODS,0.35537190082644626,dt . This means we can treat our model as a diﬀerential operator of a

s
dt where Φ0
s =
Φs,0 by feeding Φl
s to our model until Φl
s = 0. We then deﬁne a diﬀusion distance measure
ds = [dv
s] for each brain region v by simply counting how many higher order derivatives v
has and normalizing it using min-max normalization approach across all subjects. Higher
dv
s value will indicate higher likelihood of being an epicenter."

the eﬀectiveness of learning subject-speciﬁc dynamics. Surprisingly, the non-linear GRU

speciﬁc representation. While Cluster u-net doesn’t show any improvement, Adaptive u-net

performance where Φ′

organized by the lobes (marked with diﬀerent color bars) of the brain. The peak
distances in the temporal lobe indicate epicenter brain regions from where Aβ
spreads to other brain regions."
CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION ,0.6198347107438017,4. Conclusion
CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION ,0.628099173553719,"Understanding the progression dynamics of Alzheimer’s disease is a major factor in the
preclinical stages of the disease. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network-based
model to learn these dynamics from longitudinal amyloid data in a subject-wise manner.
By constraining these dynamics to a heat diﬀusion process, our model can learn robust
dynamics from a few time point data which shows eﬀectiveness in future amyloid prediction,
Alzheimer’s disease classiﬁcation, and, disease epicenter prediction."

the learned ranking.
The β-net is a multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers each
