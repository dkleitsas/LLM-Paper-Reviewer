ABSTRACT,0.0,"Abstract—Accurately assessing the count of unique elements
within voluminous data streams remains a critical task in
data analytics. The pioneering Flajolet-Martin algorithm and its
descendants, such as HyperLogLog, have pioneered the arena
of probabilistic counting techniques. However, there has been
ongoing discussion regarding the impact of hash function value
distribution on the performance of these algorithms. This study
disputes the widely held belief that the accuracy of cardinality
estimation algorithms is highly dependent on the distribution
of hash values. We demonstrate that, for a broad spectrum of
estimators, the minimum possible variance, as dictated by the
Cram´er-Rao lower bound, is actually unaffected by the choice
of hash value distribution in extreme value-based counters. To
validate our theoretical assertions, we present a novel sketching
method called Pareto sketching. Our empirical tests show that
this method delivers precision on par with the established
exponential sketching methods. Our work not only simpliﬁes
the design of future sketching algorithms but also opens new
directions for research in cardinality estimation that are not
constrained by distributional choices."
ABSTRACT,0.007194244604316547,"Index Terms—Cardinality estimation, streaming algorithms,
data sketch, distinct elements problem"
INTRODUCTION,0.014388489208633094,"I. INTRODUCTION
C
OUNTING the number of distinct elements in a data
stream is a fundamental problem in data systems. A
wide variety of applications, especially in the ﬁeld of data
mining and information retrival rely on efﬁcient counting of
distinct elements, such as duplicate document identiﬁcation
[1], graph neighbourhood function estimation [2] and genome
classiﬁcation [3]. However, it has been proved that any exact
algorithm for this problem will require storage space linear
to the number of distinct elements [4], which is infeasible
for massive data streams of billions of elements. The need for
efﬁcient approximate algorithms for distinct elements problem
naturally arises as massive data streams becomes more and
more common in realistic applications.
In 1985, Flajolet and Martin proposed the ﬁrst probabilis-
tic algorithm known as the Flajolet-Martin algorithm [5] to
approximate the number of distinct elements in the stream,
with each item being examined only one pass. They pioneered
utilizing deterministic hash functions to associate random vari-
ables with elements. In Flajolet-Martin algorithm, a uniform
hash function hi maps an element e to a L-bit binary string
h(e) ∈{0, 1}L, the largest number of consecutive zeros
starting from the least signiﬁcant bit ρ(h(e)) among all the
elements is maintained. Obviously, as there are more distinct
elements in the stream, a hash string with more consecutive
zeros is more likely to occur. The subsequent work of Flajolet-
Martin algorithm, LogLog algorithm proposed by Flajolet et,"
INTRODUCTION,0.02158273381294964,"al. [6] reduces the space required for the desired estimation
accuracy to log2 log2 N + O(1), where N is the number
of distinct elements in the stream. HyperLogLog [7] further
improves the estimator used by LogLog, and currently still
serves as the state-of-the-art cardinality estimation algorithm
in many applications. Exponential sketching [8] proposed by
Lemiesz utilizes continuous hash functions instead of discrete
bit-patterns for cardinality estimation. Even though not as
memory efﬁcient as HyperLogLog and its variants, exponential
sketching is capable of estimating cardinality of multisets in
additional to binary sets."
INTRODUCTION,0.02877697841726619,"Most existing methods for approximating cardinality make
use of the minimum or maximum of random variables of
elements. Let the hash value for different elements h(ej),
where j ∈{1, 2, · · · , N} is the index of element, be inde-
pendent and identically distributed random variables drawn
from some distribution with cumulative distribution function
F. The expression of the cumulative distribution function
of maxj h(ej) can be easily derived by F ∗(x) = F(x)N.
The distribution of the maximum is thus a statistic related
to the number of distinct elements N as long as the dis-
tribution F is not degenerate. Question naturally arises on
what effect the choice of distribution of hash values will
have on the accuracy of estimation. According to the well-
known Cram´er-Rao bound on the variance of unbiased and
biased estimators, the minimum variance that an estimator can
archive on estimating some parameter θ is associated with the
Fisher information the distribution function carries about θ.
The question now becomes what effect different distributions
of hash values will have on the accuracy of estimation. In this
paper we have proved that the minimum attainable variance is
generality unrelated with the distribution of hash values. We
proposed a new method named Pareto sketching and proved
that Pareto sketching achieves the same estimation accuracy
as exponential sketching proposed in [8]."

choose the exponential distribution as the distribution of h. The

distributed random variables with different rate parameters

their smallest order statistic h† are also exponentially dis-
tributed, whose rate parameter equal to the sum of the rate
parameter of individual exponential variables. Thus an ap-
proximation to the cardinality can be obtained by estimating
the rate parameter of X∗. As exponential variables with
rate parameter λ can be costlessly generated by dividing an
standard exponential variable by λ, exponential sketching can
be also used for cardinality estimation of multisets.

RESULTS/EXPERIMENTS,0.9424460431654677,"To demonstrate how the variance of estimation is reduced
as the number of observations K grows in a more intuitive
way, we visualize the estimations as scatters. Estimation of 10
independent runs with ﬁxed N = 100 are plotted, and it can
easily be observed that the estimations get centralized towards
N as K grows. There are also curves for predicted standard

most of the estimations lies within 2σ of the expectation N

CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION,0.9640287769784173,V. CONCLUSION
CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION,0.9712230215827338,"To sum up, our study tackled the common belief that the
choice of hash value distributions in cardinality estimation
methods has a signiﬁcant impact on the precision of the
estimates. Contrary to this belief, our ﬁndings reveal that the
Cram´er-Rao lower bound, which dictates the best possible
accuracy of any estimator, does not depend on the speciﬁc
distribution of hash values employed in extreme value coun-
ters."
CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION,0.9784172661870504,"The implication of our research is twofold. First, it sim-
pliﬁes the process of designing new sketching algorithms by
showing that the focus can be shifted away from the distri-
bution of hash values. Second, it presents Pareto sketching as
an example of a technique that is not only effective but also
stands as evidence supporting our theoretical assertion.
Pareto sketching, the method we introduced, performs on
par with the existing exponential sketching technique. This
serves as a practical demonstration that the efﬁciency of
cardinality estimation can be maintained without the need to
tailor the hash value distribution to the estimator.
In essence, our work guides future endeavors in the realm of
data stream analysis away from distribution-dependent designs
towards potentially more critical aspects that contribute to
estimator performance. By detangling the relationship between
hash value distributions and the Cram´er-Rao lower bound, we
pave the way for more versatile and theoretically grounded
approaches to cardinality estimation."
