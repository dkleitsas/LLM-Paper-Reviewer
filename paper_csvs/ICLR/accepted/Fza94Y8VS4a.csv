ABSTRACT,0.003401360544217687,"Learning-in-games has become an object of intense interest for ML due to its
connections to numerous AI architectures. We study standard online learning in
games but from a non-standard perspective. Instead of studying the behavior of a
single initial condition and whether it converges to equilibrium or not, we study the
behavior of a probability distribution/measure over a set of initial conditions. This
initial uncertainty is well motivated both from a standard game-theoretic perspec-
tive (e.g. a modeler’s uncertainty about the agents’ initial beliefs, random external
signals) as well as from a ML one (e.g. noisy measurements, system initialization
from a dataset distribution). Despite this, little is formally known about whether
and under what conditions uncertainty is ampliﬁed or reduced in these systems.
We use the popular measure of differential entropy to quantify the evolution of
uncertainty. We ﬁnd that such analysis shares an intimate relationship with vol-
ume analysis, a technique which was recently used to demonstrate the occurrence
of Lyapunov chaos when using Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) or Follow-
the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms in zero-sum games. This allows us to
show that the differential entropy of these learning-in-game systems increases lin-
early with time, formalizing their increased unpredictability over time. We show-
case the power of the framework by applying it in the study of multiple related
systems, including different standard online optimization algorithms in numerous
games and dynamics of evolutionary game theory."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01020408163265306,"A primary goal of ML research is to understand the behavior of learning algorithms in various
settings. One standard approach is to determine from each initial condition whether a learning algo-
rithm converges to a local optimum or stable state. Yet, in the context of online learning in games,
and more generally in distributed multi-agent learning, it is natural to consider the evolution of a
probability distribution over initial conditions instead. In these settings, each agent forms an initial
belief on her own, and she typically does not reveal her belief to other agents or external model-
ers/analysts. For a modeler to understand the possible behaviors of the system while being uncertain
of the agents’ beliefs, one natural approach is to infer how the initialization distributes by using data
of observations from the past. The modeler then uses this inference to predict the likelihoods of
different outcomes in the future, either by simulation or by analysis. Also, random initialization can
happen due to random external signals, e.g. weather, as well as noisy measurements. For readers
who wish to learn more mathematical aspects and intuition behind of such models, see Appendix A.
In such cases, it is critical to understand whether the initial probability distribution evolves to-
ward stability, or if its uncertainty gets ampliﬁed. Such analysis provides insight into the learning
system’s robustness against random initialization and environmental perturbations. If a system coor-
dinator desires stability but the analysis shows the uncertainty gets ampliﬁed, she ought to coordinate
with the agents to make changes, e.g. encourage them to use other online learning algorithms.
To analyze how uncertainty evolves, we need a measure of it. A natural choice is entropy.
In his seminal work in 1948, Claude Shannon formulated an axiomatic foundation of informa-
tion theory and introduced the seminal deﬁnition of Shannon entropy (SE): given a discrete ran-
dom variable with possible outcomes x1, . . . , xn which occur with probability p1, . . . , pn, its SE is"

for some i, the distribution is considered certain and its entropy is zero; uniform distribution is
viewed as the most uncertain, and it attains the maximum possible entropy of log n. For continuous

INTRODUCTION,0.027210884353741496,"Our Contributions.
In our model, a learning-in-game system starts with a distribution over a
set of initial conditions in the cumulative payoff space, a coordinate system which is inherent in
the implementations of many online learning algorithms. The initial distribution evolves over time
depending on the combination of agents’ learning algorithms and the underlying game. We focus on
two popular learning algorithms, Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) and its optimistic variant
(OMWU).1 The game settings include the standard two-player matrix games, and one-population
games which are fundamental in biological evolution models. We show that the DE of a broad range
of learning-in-game systems increases linearly with time (up to a certain limit), formalizing their
increased unpredictability. Such systems include MWU in zero-sum games, OMWU in coordination
games, and MWU in certain one-population games which reward more to intra-species play than to
inter-species play. Our results apply to any initial distribution of absolutely continuous random
vectors with ﬁnite differential entropy.
At this point one may naturally wonder: What level of uncertainty does a linear increase of DE
indicate? What are its implications? To answer these questions, it is best to compare ourselves
against other simple benchmarks. Consider the following simple learning system: in each round,
the payoffs for each action are generated from a uniform distribution over [−1, 1]. In the cumula-
tive payoff space, the distribution at time T converges to a multivariate Gaussian distribution with
variance Θ(T), and hence the entropy grows at a rate of O(log T), much slower than linear growth.
In Section 4.1, we present an implication of linear DE growth in learning-in-game systems. Brieﬂy
speaking, the DE cannot increase substantially for an indeﬁnite amount of time in such systems.
Thus, the distribution after a sufﬁciently long time must concentrate in a region that yields slower
DE growth or decline; such region does not cover any point in the cumulative payoff space that cor-
responds to an interior Nash equilibrium. We will refer to this phenomenon by “the grand escape”.
See Theorem 4.5 for the formal description of the grand escape phenomenon; an additional assump-
tion, namely the initial distribution has bounded support, is needed to establish this theorem. For the
implications in information theory, we refer readers to Chapter 8 of Cover & Thomas (2006).
The central tool in analyzing the changes of DE is the Jacobian matrix of our multi-agent dy-
namical system. This is also the key notion in volume analysis, which was used in a recent series
of papers to demonstrate Lyapunov chaos in learning-in-game systems. (Cheung & Piliouras (2019;
2020); Cheung & Tao (2020)) By showing that the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is strictly
above 1 in a large domain of the cumulative payoff space, they showed that the volume (Lebesgue
measure) of a small set of initial conditions will blow up exponentially to become a set of large
diameter, thus demonstrating a general Lyapunov chaos phenomenon in learning-in-game. Indeed,
the same property of Jacobian matrix guarantees linear increase of DE. Additionally, we present the
ﬁrst Jacobian analysis of online learning in one-population games. Finally, our DE analysis is robust
against small perturbations. Consequently, our results extend to the setting where the game in each
round can be different, as long as the payoffs are perturbations of each other. Such settings capture
many games in the real world, where we know the “reference values” of the payoffs, but the accurate
payoffs in each round differ slightly due to unknown external (random or adversarial) factors.
Our model and analysis can be viewed as an a strengthening of volume analysis. Volume analysis
focuses on whether it is possible to reach a state or not, whereas in our model we are also concerned
with how probable/likely it is to reach a state. More explicitly, a state can be reached but only
with a tiny chance. When studying chaos and volume, such states matter, but less so when studying
uncertainty as their contributions to entropy will be low. To illuminate this, we simulate MWU (with
step-size 0.01) in Matching Pennies game, and present a few plots in Figure 2. The top-left plot
shows the initial set, which is a small square around the unique Nash equilibrium. The top-right plot"
INTRODUCTION,0.030612244897959183,"1As we shall point out in Section 3, all our results about MWU also extend easily to the broad family
of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms, which is a generalization of MWU. For clarity of our
presentation, we choose to focus on MWU in this paper."

Learning models that explicitly study the effects random initialization
have received relatively little attention in game theory where static equilibrium concepts are typically
the preferred solution. Lahkar & Seymour (2013) studies online learning under random initializa-
tion in population dynamics, where one population game is a common payoff model. In population
dynamics, there exists a large population of agents who have different initial choices of mixed strate-
gies, modeled as a distribution. The dynamics proceed by randomly pairing up agents in each round
to play a game. Lahkar & Seymour (2014) extends this framework to other learning dynamics to
describe the evolution of a distribution of mixed strategies in a population playing variants of Rock-
Paper-Scissors games establishing local convergence to the interior equilibrium. Recently, further
learning models inspired by Q-learning dynamics have been deﬁned (Hu et al., 2019). Very little is
formally known about the behavior of such models particularly under instability.
For zero-sum games with an interior Nash equilibrium, “the grand escape” phenomenon follows
from Bailey & Piliouras (2018); Cheung (2018), who showed that MWU diverges away from Nash.
Our results are more general, since their analysis only works with those zero-sum game dynamics,
while our technique applies to many other game dynamics as well. Such instability results in zero-
sum games are undesirable for ML applications such as GANs thus a lot of effort has been invested
in developing algorithms that achieve convergence Daskalakis et al. (2017); Mertikopoulos et al.
(2019); Daskalakis & Panageas (2018); Gidel et al. (2019); Mokhtari et al. (2020); Perolat et al.
(2021). Our research direction here is in some sense orthogonal. We aim to characterize in a more
detailed fashion the behavior of learning dynamics despite their instability.
The instability of MWU, FTRL and other optimization-driven dynamics in games has attracted
a lot of attention in recent years. One formal technique to establish the unpredictability of MWU"

INTRODUCTION,0.06802721088435375,"and other dynamics is based on proving Li-Yorke chaos, which has been established robustly in dif-
ferent families of routing/potential/Cournot games (Palaiopanos et al. (2017); Chotibut et al. (2020);
Bielawski et al. (2021); Cheung et al. (2021)). The techniques in those papers are independent from
ours as they require the identiﬁcation of one dimensional invariant manifolds, and Li-Yorke chaos
implies the existence of periodic orbits, which is not possible in our systems. In a very recent series
of works, Flokas et al. (2020); Giannou et al. (2021) established that all (even partially) mixed equi-
libria in all games are not asymptotically stable for any choice for FTRL dynamics both in discrete
as well as in the idealized continuous-time limit. In fact, it is possible to construct simple matrix
games such that the orbits of the resulting dynamics can be arbitrarily complex Andrade et al. (2021).
If, inspired by ML applications, we allow for more complex differentiable games it becomes even
simpler to establish strong instability results for effectively any type of training algorithms (Letcher
(2020); Balduzzi et al. (2020)). The sweeping nature of these strong negative results showcases the
practical interest in uncovering more information about the nature of unstable dynamics of games.
Our proposed framework introduces a novel, quantitative methodology for their study.
The notion of differential entropy (DE) has been used as uncertainty measure in many works
across multiple disciplines. We note that while the extended deﬁnition of DE seems natural, it is
not considered as the perfect generalization of SE since it misses some favorable properties, and
therefore, as quoted from the popular information theory text of Cover & Thomas (2006), “there
is need for some care in using the concept”.3 Nevertheless, DE remains an effective measure of
uncertainty4, which is commonly used in physics, economics, control theory, engineering, biology,
medical research and beyond. For a general discussion, we refer readers to the text of Cover &
Thomas (2006). For background information of evolutionary game theory, we recommend Hofbauer
& Sigmund (1998); Sandholm (2010); Vega-Redondo (1996)."

DIFFERENTIAL ENTROPY,0.18027210884353742,"The Relationship Between DE and Volume.
Before discussing the relationship, we ﬁrst recap
what is volume. Let X ⊂Rd be a measurable set with positive Lebesgue measure (which is some-
times called the volume of the set), and let f : Rd →Rd be a diffeomorphism. The volume of f(X)
is
R"
DIFFERENTIAL ENTROPY,0.1836734693877551,"X |det Jf(x)| dx. When |det Jf(x)| ≥1 + α for all x ∈X, the volume increases by a factor of
at least (1+α). If this occurs in a dynamical system every round, the volume of the initial set grows
exponentially with time, and hence also its diameter, establishing that Lyapunov chaos occurs.
The occurrence of the Jacobian in both the formulae for computing volume and the change of
DE in (7) is not a coincidence, but with a simple intuition behind. The Jacobian yields a linear
approximation of f locally: for any x ∈Rd and any small perturbation vector ∆x ∈Rd, f(x +
∆x) ≈f(x) + Jf(x) · ∆x. We consider a tiny hypercube with volume v around x, and its image
under the function f. By the linear approximation, the image is approximately a parallelotope
(the high-dimensional analogue of parallelogram), whose volume is known to be |det Jf(x)| · v. By
partitioning X into inﬁnitesimal tiny hypercubes and summing up, this is intuitively how the integral
formula for computing volume is obtained. Next, suppose the probability density at x is g(x). The
probability of the tiny hypercube is approximately g(x) · v. After the transformation f, this amount
of probability is spread approximately uniformly in the parallelotope, thus the new density at f(x)
is g(x)/ |det Jf(x)|. If the volume increases locally at x, i.e. |det Jf(x)| > 1, it intuitively means
the uncertainty level increases locally. This intuition is captured by DE: the contribution to DE by
the tiny hypercube is −g(x) · v log(g(x) · v), while the contribution to DE by the parallelotope is
−g(x)·v log
g(x)·v
|det Jf (x)|. Thus, the local change of DE is g(x)·v log |det Jf(x)|, which has the same
sign as (|det Jf(x)| −1). To summarize, local volume increase is equivalent local DE increase.
This equivalence allows us to spot that for those learning systems in two-player matrix games
studied in the series of volume analysis papers of Cheung & Piliouras (2019; 2020); Cheung &
Tao (2020), their DE with our model increases linearly in a large domain of the cumulative payoff
space. We present this result formally Section 4.1, and present an interesting consequence of the DE
growth. Partly motivated by Lahkar & Seymour (2013), we also transfer the techniques to analyzing
one-population games in Section 4.2, and we present two sufﬁcient conditions on these games that
leads to linear DE growth with MWU.
As ﬁrst spotted by Cheung & Piliouras (2019), these results not only cover MWU and OMWU,
but also the broad family of FTRL algorithms, since the properties of the Jacobian for FTRL is very
similar to that of MWU. (This is not surprising since FTRL is a generalization of MWU.)"

MWU IN ONE POPULATION GAME,0.3741496598639456,"Two Sufﬁcient Conditions for Linear DE Growth.
Recall that to demonstrate linear DE growth,
we want the determinant of the Jacobian to be strictly larger than 1. By Lemma 4.6, a clear sufﬁcient
condition is: Akk + Ak′k′ ≥Akk′ + Ak′k for all k and k′, and there exist k, k′ such that the
inequality is strict. But when there is no k, k′ with strict inequality, it is still possible to have linear
DE growth if the second order term is strictly positive. We present precise statements regarding
these two cases below. To proceed, we deﬁne s(A), which is positive for the ﬁrst case:s(A) =
1
2 · maxk,k′{Akk + Ak′k′ −Akk′ −Ak′k}.
For the ﬁrst case, we now bound the higher order terms. Note that since |Akk′| ≤1 and hence
|Rkk′| ≤2. When expanding the determinant using the Leibniz formula, we get a polynomial of ϵ.
For any i ≥2, each ϵi term in the expansion must be of the format ϵi times a product of i factors
of the form Rk1,k2, so each such term has absolute value bounded by 2iϵi. To count the number
of such terms, note that within each term, the collection of k1’s is same as the collection of k2’s,
but the order of k2 can be any permutation of the k1’s. A simple counting shows there are at most

MOTIVATING EXAMPLE"
REFERENCES,0.6292517006802721,"To explain our mathematical model intuitively, we present the following simple one-dimensional
example. Let f(x) = 2x, and suppose that X0 is a random variable uniform on the interval [0, 1].
Then X1 = f(X0) becomes another random variable, which is uniform on [0, 2]. Analogously,
X2 = f(X1) is a new random variable being uniform on [0, 4]. Generally speaking, the problem is
to understand how the initial random variable X0 evolves under a given deterministic iterated update
rule f, and to study how the uncertainty evolves using the measure of differential entropy. In our
paper, we focus on such systems which arise in the context of learning-in-games.
In a learning-in-game system, X0 = (p0, q0) represents a distribution over initial beliefs (initial
cumulative payoffs) of the two players, and Xt = (pt, qt) represents the distribution of cumulative
payoffs at time t. Such a probabilistic formulation is natural from the perspective of an external
analyst (who is not a player of the game), who cannot be certain about what the initial beliefs the
players have. For her to proceed with an analysis of the system, a natural approach is to infer the
initial distributions from either the past data, or her knowledge about how random external signals
inﬂuence the initializations. The iterated update rule f in this case is determined by the learning
algorithms used by the players, and by the underlying game. For instance, if both players are using
MWU in a bimatrix game (A, B), the update rule f is given by (4).
Unlike the motivating example, for learning-in-game systems the dimensions can be arbitrarily
high, and the update rule is non-linear. Thus, deriving the exact evolution of the distribution of Xt
is very hard in general. But we can still use the popular statistical measure, differential entropy
(DE), to understand the evolution of uncertainty. We show that the DE increases linearly with time
for various combinations of learning algorithms and games, including MWU in zero-sum games,
OMWU in coordination games, and MWU in certain one-population games. Section 2 has precise
descriptions of the learning algorithms and the games. These results can be extended to a broad
family of non-zero-sum and non-coordination games, via the Jacobian analysis by Cheung & Tao
(2020). The results also extend to gradient ascent, as it is known to be a special case of FTRL."

1 + δ4Lϵ2/8 for all sufﬁciently small ϵ.
Since the product (Ajk + Aj′k′ −Ajk′ −Aj′k)(Bjk + Bj′k′ −Bjk′ −Bj′k) depends on A, B
continuously, it is natural to expect that when A, B are slightly perturbed, the value of the product
changes also slightly. To make this precise, we suppose that in each round t, the actual payoff
matrices are (At, Bt), and their entries are perturbations from (A, B) by at most an absolute value
of β ≤2.6 Recall that the entries in A, B are bounded in the interval [−1, 1], so the absolute
values of Ajk + Aj′k′ −Ajk′ −Aj′k and Bjk′ + Bj′k −Bjk −Bj′k′ are bounded by 4, while the
perturbations to their values are bounded by 4β. By the lemma below, for the game (At, Bt), the
bound in (11) still hold by replacing its lower bound with L −34β, and the bound in (12) still hold
by replacing its lower bound with −34β. Thus the determinant of the Jacobian matrix in S1 is at
least 1 + (δ4L/4 −34β)ϵ2/2 ≥1 + δ4Lϵ2/16 if β ≤δ4L/272."
