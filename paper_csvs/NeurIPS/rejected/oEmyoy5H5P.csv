Background

ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.04189560439560439,"2.1
On algorithmic recourse
61"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.042582417582417584,"Algorithmic – or actionable, individual – recourse was introduced in [138] as “the ability of a person
62"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.04326923076923077,"to change the decision of the model through actionable input variables”, building on the earlier
63"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.04395604395604396,"work of [151] who argued that CEs are a psychologically-grounded way to (1) help decision-subjects
64"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.044642857142857144,"understand an algorithmic decision, (2) provide them with information needed to contest it, and (3)
65"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.04532967032967033,"inform about actions that could be taken to overturn it. For instance, consider a person who has
66"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.04601648351648352,"unsuccessfully applied for a loan; they may then receive AR such as “if you requested $5000 less,
67"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.046703296703296704,"you would qualify for this loan”. The key consideration for AR is “actionability”, which entails that
68"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.04739010989010989,"the recipient of the recommendation should be capable of implementing it. If they had been informed
69"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.04807692307692308,"“if you were 10 years younger, you would qualify for the loan”, they would have still received a
70"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.048763736263736264,"valid CE, but not recourse. More recently [69] has recast the problem as reasoning about minimal
71"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.04945054945054945,"interventions on the structural causal model. This formulation (at least theoretically) addresses an
72"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.05013736263736264,"important shortcoming of “correlational” recourse. Without accounting for the downstream causal
73"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.050824175824175824,"effects of actions, an individual may exert more effort than necessary and still fail to achieve the
74"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.05151098901098901,"target outcome. Indeed, counterfactuals are an inherently causal concept [103].
75"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.0521978021978022,"We note that problems similar to AR have been studied under a variety of different names: actionable

ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.05425824175824176,"generally focused on “business” knowledge, rather than individual recommendations, but ultimately
79"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.054945054945054944,"the goal of all these approaches is to extract information from a (black-box) model that allows the

ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.05631868131868132,"not have to be achieved through the means of CEs. Rather CEs should be seen as one of the means
82"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.057005494505494504,"to achieve AR, particularly promising in that they do not require expert-level understanding of the

84"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.05837912087912088,"equated with actionable CEs), and these alternative formulations in our work.
85"
ON ALGORITHMIC RECOURSE,0.059065934065934064,"Existing research has generally considered AR in simplistic settings that are far removed from

356"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.26304945054945056,"1. Broadening the scope of research.
AR is generally seen as a service for affected individuals,
357"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.26373626373626374,"but this formalization may be unnecessarily limiting. In fact, in many systems, these individuals may
358"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.2644230769230769,"be unable to directly act on recommendations [see also 142]. Instead, we propose to operationalize
359"

361"

362"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.26717032967032966,"2. Engaging end users, affected individuals, and communities.
AR solutions are rarely evaluated
363"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.26785714285714285,"with humans. Instead, they attempt to satisfy a variety of desiderata formulated by authors and
364"

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.2706043956043956,"concerning recourse, and to validate its potential contributions and inherent limitations. Authors may
368"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.27129120879120877,"also benefit from the rich literature on human-computer interaction [e.g., 11, 23] or psychology.
369"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.27197802197802196,"3. Accepting a socio-technical perspective.
A pervasive assumption in the literature is that all
370"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.27266483516483514,"challenges of AR require purely technical solutions. For instance, many authors emphasize the
371"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.2733516483516483,"importance of causal modeling to guarantee recourse, but the models that aim to be explained are
372"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.27403846153846156,"themselves not causal. Similarly, to improve the performance of CE generators many authors turn to
373"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.27472527472527475,"deep generative models [35, 42, 61, 67, 81, 90, 99]. Not only do they explain the data rather than the
374"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.27541208791208793,"model [10], but more importantly they shift the problem from improving the trust in non-interpretable
375"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.2760989010989011,"models, to attempting to trust non-interpretable explainers. Although a socio-technical perspective
376"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.2767857142857143,"on AR brings its own challenges, such as accounting for the roles of stakeholders involved in the
377"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.2774725274725275,"provision of recourse, it creates important opportunities. For example, developing “recourse contracts”
378"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.27815934065934067,"[34, 39] or designing feedback processes to account for imperfect robustness.
379"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.27884615384615385,"4. Accounting for emergent effects.
Decision-making systems involve multiple individuals who
380"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.27953296703296704,"may be interested in receiving recourse and may have competing interests. Research on AR should,
381"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.2802197802197802,"from the onset, explore group-level effects such as external costs or fairness. While this may require
382"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.2809065934065934,"expanding the boundaries of analysis, it is necessary to anticipate the emergent outcomes of recourse.
383"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.2815934065934066,"These may even occur due to the multi-system dynamics of AR: recommendations implemented by
384"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.2822802197802198,"an individual to improve their outcomes in one system will affect them in other contexts [see also 13].
385"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.28296703296703296,"5. Attending to other operational aspects.
Finally, the artifacts of AR research should be
386"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.28365384615384615,"practitioner-friendly. On the one hand, this requires being explicit about the position of the proposed
387"

388"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.2850274725274725,"tioners to better understand the benefits of the proposed solutions. On the other hand, this suggests
389"
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,0.2857142857142857,"that authors should attempt to move away from merely providing scripts for experiments, and focus
