ABSTRACT,0.0045662100456621,"We introduce a new approach for speech pre-training named SPIRAL which works
by learning denoising representation of perturbed data in a teacher-student frame-
work.
Speciﬁcally, given a speech utterance, we ﬁrst feed the utterance to a
teacher network to obtain corresponding representation. Then the same utter-
ance is perturbed and fed to a student network. The student network is trained to
output representation resembling that of the teacher. At the same time, the teacher
network is updated as moving average of student’s weights over training steps. In
order to prevent representation collapse, we apply an in-utterance contrastive loss
as pre-training objective and impose position randomization on the input to the
teacher. SPIRAL achieves competitive or better results compared to state-of-the-
art speech pre-training method wav2vec 2.0, with signiﬁcant reduction of training
cost (80% for BASE model, 65% for LARGE model). Furthermore, we address
the problem of noise-robustness that is critical to real-world speech applications.
We propose multi-condition pre-training by perturbing the student’s input with
various types of additive noise. We demonstrate that multi-condition pre-trained
SPIRAL models are more robust to noisy speech (9.0% - 13.3% relative word er-
ror rate reduction on real noisy test data), compared to applying multi-condition
training solely in the ﬁne-tuning stage. Source code is available 1."

INTRODUCTION,0.0136986301369863,"Industrial-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are usually trained with ten-thousands
of hours of hand-transcribed speech data (Galvez et al., 2021). However, labeling speech data is ex-
pensive and time-consuming, especially for languages with small speaker populations, or for speciﬁc
domains (e.g., legal, ﬁnancial, scientiﬁc)."
INTRODUCTION,0.0182648401826484,"Recently, methods of utilizing unlabeled speech data to improve speech recognition system have
achieved remarkable progress. Amongst them, self-training (Manohar et al., 2015; Kahn et al.,
2020a; Synnaeve et al., 2020a; Chen et al., 2020b; Xu et al., 2020; Park et al., 2020b; Xiao et al.,
2021), also known as pseudo-labeling, starts by training an ASR model with labeled speech data,
which is referred to as teacher model. Then the teacher model, usually combined with a language
model (LM), is used to produce pseudo-labels for unlabeled speech data. Finally, the labeled data
and the pseudo-labeled data are combined to train a new model, which is referred to as student
model. The process is repeated by taking the student model as the teacher in next iteration. Another
line of work is speech pre-training (van den Oord et al., 2019; Chung & Glass, 2020; Wang et al.,
2020; Baevski et al., 2020b; Liu et al., 2020). Pre-training learns speech representation from unla-
beled data in a self-supervised way. The pre-trained model is then ﬁne-tuned on the labeled data.
Self-training and pre-training are complementary as shown in recent work (Xu et al., 2021; Zhang
et al., 2020)."

INTRODUCTION,0.0365296803652968,"Perturbation-Invariant Representation Learning (SPIRAL). Compared to state-of-the-art speech pre-
training methods such as wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020b) and HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021), our
method allows end-to-end training with a single contrastive loss, and without relying on discrete unit
discovery techniques such as vector quantization (J´egou et al., 2011; Baevski et al., 2020a;b) or iter-
ative clustering process (Hsu et al., 2021). We apply multi-condition training with SPIRAL (Seltzer
et al., 2013; Ko et al., 2015) to improve noise-robustness for the downstream speech tasks."
INTRODUCTION,0.0410958904109589,"SPIRAL is motivated by the observation that human tolerates speech perturbations or distortions
fairly well. For example, people can communicate effectively in a noisy environment, or over a
distorted telephone channel. Therefore, we hypothesize that by learning representation invariant to
perturbation, the model will learn high-level representation which can enhance speech applications."
INTRODUCTION,0.045662100456621,"To learn perturbation-invariant representation in a self-supervised way, we employ a teacher-student
framework similar to Tarvainen & Valpola (2017). During pre-training, given a speech utterance, we
guide the student network which consumes the perturbed utterance to learn from the teacher network
which consumes the clean utterance. The student is trained to produce denoised representation of
the perturbed utterance similar to teacher’s representation of the clean utterance. Meanwhile, the
teacher, which shares the same model architecture with student, is updated as moving average of the
student’s weights over past training steps."
INTRODUCTION,0.0502283105022831,"We apply the in-utterance contrastive loss to avoid model collapse to trivial constant representa-
tion (Chopra et al., 2005). As speech utterance are sequential data, there is another possible trivial
solution which we call positional collapse. Positional collapse occurs when the student “cheats” by
exploiting position correlation in teacher’s representation to minimize the loss, while ignoring the
content of the input utterance. To prevent positional collapse, we propose position randomization
by adding random number of paddings on both sides of input utterance to the teacher."
INTRODUCTION,0.0547945205479452,"Large-scale speech pre-training is computationally demanding. To reduce computation cost, we
adopt a gradual down-sampling strategy in SPIRAL model, which has been veriﬁed effective in
speech recognition literatures with negligible performance degradation (Peddinti et al., 2018; Han
et al., 2020b; Huang et al., 2020). We also speculate that aggressive down-sampling helps to remove
redundancy in speech."
INTRODUCTION,0.0593607305936073,"To evaluate the effectiveness of SPIRAL, we conduct experiments on LibriSpeech and Libri-Light
datasets. By training a small convolutional classiﬁer on the representation of a frozen SPIRAL
model, we can achieve WER of 3.5% and 6.4% on Librispeech test-clean and test-other respectively.
SPIRAL achieves competitive or better results compared to state-of-the-art speech pre-training
methods, while being much more training-efﬁcient. We also demonstrate that multi-condition pre-
trained SPIRAL are more robust to noisy speech with 9.0% - 13.3% relative word error rate (WER)
reduction on real noisy test data from ChiME-3 (Barker et al., 2015), compared to the model apply-
ing multi-condition training solely in ﬁne-tuning stage."

teacher network which is the moving average version of the student in the semi-supervised learning
setting. The authors apply a supervised loss for labeled data and a consistency loss between teacher
and student predictions for unlabeled data. However, direct application of MT to self-supervised
learning leads to representation collapse (Grill et al., 2020)."

demonstrates the importance of the aggressive injection of noise into the student. Although not
emphasized, no noise is injected into pseudo-labeling process of the teacher. We consider our work
as an extension of self-training approach to the self-supervised learning regime. Instead of using the
teacher to provide pseudo-labels, we utilize the teacher for pseudo-reference representation."

such as speech recognition. Previous work (Baevski et al., 2019) shows that speech pre-training
by recovering masked input speech features is not effective. In SPIRAL, we instead enforce latent
representation of a corrupted input to resemble that of the corresponding clean input."

RELATED WORK,0.0867579908675799,"Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) (Grill et al., 2020) is a self-supervised image representation
learning method. The method is based on a teacher-student framework similar to MT. The authors
refer to student network as online network and teacher network as target network. They observe
that naive application of MT to self-supervised learning leads to trivial constant representation.
They prevent the representation collapse by appending a predictor to the student network. The
theory behind is under investigation (Chen & He, 2021; Tian et al., 2021). Our method draws
inspirations from BYOL and shares the similar architecture, but there are crucial differences. Instead
of learning a single global representation for an image as in BYOL, SPIRAL learns a sequence of
representation for an utterance. We aim for sequence applications such as speech recognition. In our
preliminary experiments, we observe that appending a predictor to student network is not sufﬁcient
to prevent trivial constant representation for sequential representation learning. We use in-utterance
contrastive loss (Baevski et al., 2020b) combined with input position randomization to successfully
avoid representation collapse. We still keep the predictor in SPIRAL, but only for the sake of
performance improvement from our observation. Another difference is that BYOL does not perform
representation denoising. BYOL applies perturbation, which they call augmentation, to both the
inputs of the teacher and the student. We demonstrate that representation denoising is crucial for
speech pre-training. When perturbation is applied to the teacher’s input, the effectiveness of speech
pre-training degrades drastically."
RELATED WORK,0.091324200913242,"Wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020b) is a self-supervised speech representation learning method
which belongs to the masked prediction family. Masked prediction methods are effective for text
pre-training (Devlin et al., 2019), but not for speech pre-training when naively applied (Baevski
et al., 2019). The reason is that speech data contains redundancy such as speaker information, pro-
nunciation variations, which are irrelevant to the semantic meaning of the utterance. To overcome
this problem, wav2vec 2.0 perform masking in intermediate latent space and performs target dis-
cretization with a differentiable quantization scheme. However, quantization leads to a more com-
plex model by introducing additional hyper-parameters and an additional diversity loss. SPIRAL
does not utilize quantization, and still achieves competitive performance compared to wav2vec 2.0.
We hypothesize that aggressive down-sampling and learning by matching output representation may
help to remove redundancy from the learned representation. We leave the investigation of whether
target discretization could further improve SPIRAL for future work."

we refer to as positional collapse. Contrastive candidates are sampled based on their positions in
utterances. When a teacher’s representation z′
i is correlated with its position i (e.g., correlation
introduced by positional encoding in Transformer), the student could exploit this correlation to gen-
erate its representation zi solely based on the position index i, while ignoring content of the input.
In this case, the model does not learn meaningful representation of the input content. Therefore,
we prevent positional collapse by randomizing positions of teacher’s representation. In particular,
we add random number of padding data at both ends of the input to the teacher to randomly shift
the position information for each output representation z′
i. The student thereby is unable to exploit
the spurious position information to minimize the contrastive loss. Note that when calculating the
contrastive loss, we exclude the corresponding representation of the padded data."

INPUT PERTURBATION AND COMPUTATION NOISE OF TEACHER,0.593607305936073,"SPIRAL learns denoised representation of perturbed data. By default, we only apply perturbation to
the input of the student. An alternative method is to perturb both inputs of the teacher and the student,
and optimize consistency between their representations (Grill et al., 2020; Chen & He, 2021). We
conduct experiments to evaluate the effects of perturbing the input and adding computation noise
(dropout and LayerDrop) to the teacher. The results are shown in Table 8 in Appendix A.3. The
results suggest that applying SpecAugment to teacher’s input degrades performance signiﬁcantly.
Performance degradation decreases but is still signiﬁcant with lower ratio and width of the masks.
This supports the necessity of representation denoising, and our view of SPIRAL as an extension of
self-training in which teacher network are fed with clean input. The results also support applying
computation noise to teacher during pre-training. There is a 15.9% relative WER reduction with
computation noise. This may be linked to Gal & Ghahramani (2016)."

EFFECTS OF PREDICTOR AND PROJECTION HEAD,0.6027397260273972,"We do ablation studies to understand the role of predictor and projection head in SPIRAL. The re-
sults are shown in Table 9 in Appendix A.3. When removing the predictor from the student, we
observe performance degradation, but representation collapse does not happen. In the architectures
relying on predictor to prevent collapse (Grill et al., 2020; Chen & He, 2021), applying batch nor-
malization (BN) in the predictor is essential. While in SPIRAL, we observe that BN in the predictor
can be replaced by layer normalization (LN) with a small performance degradation. When the pre-
dictor is removed, we observe performance improvement by applying a convolutional projection
head. The convolutional projection head is composed of a temporal convolution layer with LN and
ReLU, and a linear layer. But applying convolutional projection head to the model with a predictor,
there is no further performance improvement. This suggests that convolutional projection head and
predictor play a similar role in SPIRAL, and they are not complementary."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.6118721461187214,"We presented SPIRAL, a new approach to speech pre-training by learning denoising representation
of perturbed data with a teacher-student framework. SPIRAL can learn high-level speech repre-
sentation in self-supervised way. Training a small convolutional classiﬁer on frozen representation
of SPIRAL achieves WER of 3.5% and 6.4% on Librispeech test-clean and test-other respectively.
We show that SPIRAL achieves competitive or better results compared to state-of-the-art speech
pre-training methods, with signiﬁcant reduction of training cost. We investigate multi-condition
pre-training and demonstrates that multi-condition pre-training is more effective than solely apply-
ing multi-condition training in the ﬁne-tuning stage. We presume SPIRAL as a general pre-training
method, which can apply to other modalities such as images and text. We leave it for future work."
