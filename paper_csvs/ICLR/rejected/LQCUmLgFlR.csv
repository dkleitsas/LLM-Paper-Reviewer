ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0049504950495049506,"Early stopping is a simple and widely used method to prevent over-training neu-
ral networks. We develop theoretical results to reveal the relationship between
optimal early stopping time and model dimension as well as sample size of the
dataset for certain linear regression models. Our results demonstrate two very dif-
ferent behaviors when the model dimension exceeds the number of features versus
the opposite scenario. While most previous works on linear models focus on the
latter setting, we observe that in common deep learning tasks, the dimension of
the model often exceeds the number of features arising from data. We demon-
strate experimentally that our theoretical results on optimal early stopping time
corresponds to the training process of deep neural network. Moreover, we study
the effect of early stopping on generalization and demonstrate that optimal early
stopping can help mitigate “double descent” in various settings."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01485148514851485,"Generalization, accuracy, and computation are three of the major aspects in deploying large scale
machine learning models. They are often brought together into an optimization framework, where
the first two aspects concern stationary solution and the last aspect concerns convergence proper-
ties of the algorithm. As a result, most previous works have analyzed them separately, seeking to
strike a balance between generalization and accuracy first then understand computational complex-
ity (Zhang, 2002). These approaches often design a regularizer in the form of a penalty term added
to the objective function (c.f., Nakkiran et al., 2020b, and references therein). While this method
is effective in many settings, it can prove challenging to determine the regularization that guaran-
tees appealing behaviors. Adding to the complication is the fact that they are often designed to
avoid overfitting when the optimization algorithm converges. It is not obvious how the behavior will
change if the algorithm stops before the convergence of the optimization procedure."
INTRODUCTION,0.019801980198019802,"Recent success of deep learning models combined with gradient based optimization has prompted
increasingly many works to focus on blending the computation aspect into the picture of
generalization–accuracy tradeoff (Du et al., 2018). Such approaches often leverage implicit proper-
ties of the optimization algorithms in conjunction of the model and the data structures and are thus
referred to as implicit regularization methods. In training of deep neural networks, techniques such
as stochastic gradient descent, batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), and dropouts (Srivas-
tava et al., 2014) are widely used to grant generalization properties implicitly."
INTRODUCTION,0.024752475247524754,"In this paper, we study regularization via early stopping (Morgan & Bourlard, 1989; Zhang & Yu,
2005; Yao et al., 2007). While in practice, early stopping is often forced by computational budget
constraints, we focus on its efficacy in avoiding overfitting towards the training dataset. In the
presence of label noise, in particular, we study the common strategy of concluding the training
process at the optimal early stopping time, which achieves the lowest test risk before it increases
again. One crucial question is how this optimal early stopping time relates to the model size and
sample size. Answering this question not only provides guidance for the model training process in
practice, but also contributes to the understanding of the generalization property of different models."

that under the setting adopted therein, the optimal early stopping time increases along with the
model size. However, this trend is contrary to what we observed in traning neural networks. We
observed that when training popular datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 using deep neural
networks, the optimal early stopping time decreases as the model size increases (see Figure 1).
These two contradicting trends indicate that previous theoretical models are not sufficient to explain
what happens in practice."
INTRODUCTION,0.06435643564356436,"Overparametrization vs. Underparametrization
We noticed that despite the huge models used
to train those datasets, their labels are actually generated by low dimensional representations or
features (See Section 4.2). Previous theoretical works have primarily focused on the case where
the model dimension is approximately the same or less than the number of features instead of the
opposite scenario (Ali et al., 2019; Belkin et al., 2020; Nakkiran et al., 2020b). To complete the
missing pieces in previous analyses, we propose a new model where the label is generated by a
low-dimensional transformation of the input data. We define the case where the model size is
larger than the number of features as being overparametrized. We verify experimentally that this
overparametrized case better reflects what happens in training neural networks. This new over-
parametrization setting demonstrates very different behavior from the previous theoretical model,
which resolves the contradiction we previously observed."
INTRODUCTION,0.06930693069306931,"We illustrate both theoretically and experimentally that the optimal stopping time behaves very dif-
ferently when the number of features is smaller (overparametrization) or larger (underparametriza-
tion) than the model size. In the overparametrization setting, the optimal early stopping time de-
creases as the model dimension increases or as the sample size decreases, similar to what we observe
when training deep neural networks for image classification tasks. On the other hand, in the under-
parametrization setting, the optimal early stopping time increases as the model dimension increases
or as the number of samples increases.We corroborate experimentally that these trends persist when
training various linear models and neural networks (e.g., Figure 2)."
INTRODUCTION,0.07425742574257425,"Generalization of the early stopped-models
Even for the same model, stopping at the optimal
early stopping time versus after the training converges can lead to solutions with very different
generalization properties. Another problem we study is how the test risk of models changes as a
function of other training parameters when stopped at the optimal early stopping time. In particular,
it has been shown that without regularization, the test risk can exhibit the so-called “double descent”
phenomenon (Belkin et al., 2018; Nakkiran et al., 2020a), where the risk as a function of model
size or sample size experience two distinct phases of descent. This phenomenon can make deciding
the best model parameters challenging. We demonstrate that early stopping helps mitigate double
descent in multiple settings."

OVERPARAMETRIZATION,0.1188118811881188,"In this section, we introduce and analyze the overparametrization setting, where the model size
exceeds the number of features. This setting completes the missing piece of previous theoretical
analysis on large models with excessive parameters. For data (x, y), the input x ∈Rd is from a high
dimensional space. The label y ∈R is generated from a low-dimensional feature representation
z ∈Rp, p ≤d, which is mapped from x by a low-dimensional transformation. A lot of common
deep learning applications falls under this setting. Despite the huge model size used, the underlying
feature space dimension can be low. For example, we observe that the labels y in CIFAR10, a widely
used image classification problem with 10 classes, can be generated by a feature space of dimension
a little more than 10 (See Section 4.2)."

OVERPARAMETRIZATION,0.13861386138613863,"We let Sover denote the overparametrization setting studied in this section. This setting is inspired by
the overparametrization property of many real datasets and models. For example, to classify images
using deep neural network, the labels can usually be determined by features extracted from certain
important parts of the images. The other parts of the image, though do not contribute to the label
much, are still input to the model. When the neural network is wide, the network has the ability to
extract far more features than what contribute to the label. This character of the deep neural network
is what the setting Sover attempts to model."
OVERPARAMETRIZATION,0.14356435643564355,"Our data assumption has been studied in many related literature (Belkin et al., 2020; Nakkiran et al.,
2020b). Our analysis only relies on the concentration property of singular values of the data matrix
X, so it is possible relax the data assumptions on X to bounds on the minimum and maximum
singular values of the data matrix (Vaswani & Nayer, 2016). The linear model has been widely used
as the first step to study more complicated models as well due to its simple form (Bartlett et al.,

when the number of features is smaller than the model dimension, optimal early stopping time
increases as n increases or d decreases. Section F.1 corroborates this trend using experiments. In
addition, we show in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3 that training deep neural networks on large real
datasets can also follow these two trends. An intuitive explanation of such phenomenon is when the
sample size is large, the label noise has less effect on model training, so the model can be trained
longer before overfitting starts. On the contrary, when d increases, the number of parameters is large
so that even small updates of each parameter can result in overfitting."

Many previous works observe that

transfer learning paradigm where image features are learned and fixed close to the input layer, re-
ducing the complexity of image-to-label mapping. Then only the last layer is trained to adapt to and
classify out-of-domain images (Chen et al., 2020b). We follow this approach and demonstrate the
existence of the low-rank structures in Figure 3, where we plot the singular values of the representa-
tions of MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. First, we train CNN/ResNet-60 (He et al., 2016a;b) to

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.7524752475247525,"In this paper, we propose a new model of overparametrization to study the optimal early stopping
time. This model captures the phenomenon that the model size usually exceeds the number of
features in practice. We believe this model of overparametrization can be of independent interest.
One future direction is the performance of other optimizers or techniques, e.g., stochastic gradient
descent or data augmentation, on this model. Moreover, we give an explicit characterization of the
early stopping time and the resulting model. Future works can explore other regularization properties
of this early stopped model, e.g., whether this early stopping helps when there is a domain shift in
the testing dataset."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.7574257425742574,"Another direction worth exploring is to extend our results to nonlinear settings. Extending our result
to the lazy training regime of neural networks (e.g., random feature regime and neural tangent kernel
regime) can be relatively straightforward. One approach is to first locate the features extracted at
initizalition and then show how gradient flow progresses on the features extracted. Theoretical
analysis of the non-lazy training is still a largely open question, so extending this result to non-lazy
setting can be more challenging. To extend this result to the non-lazy setting for a fully nonlinear
neural network model, one needs to study how the features extracted change and how the weights
on the features change at the same time."
