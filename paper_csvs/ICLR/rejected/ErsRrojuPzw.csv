ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.006993006993006993,"Convolutional neural networks are widely used in practical application in many
diverse environments. Each different environment requires a different optimized
network to maximize accuracy under its unique hardware constraints and latency
requirements. To ﬁnd models for this varied array of potential deployment tar-
gets, once-for-all (OFA) was introduced as a way to simultaneously co-train many
models at once, while keeping the total training cost constant. However, the to-
tal training cost is very high, requiring up to 1200 GPU-hours. Compound OFA
(compOFA) decreased the training cost of OFA by 2× by coupling model dimen-
sions to reduce the search space of possible models by orders of magnitude, while
also simplifying the training procedure.
In this work, we continue the effort to reduce the training cost of OFA methods.
While both OFA and compOFA use a pre-trained teacher network, we propose an
in-place knowledge distillation procedure to train the super-network simultane-
ously with the sub-networks. Within this in-place distillation framework, we de-
velop an upper-attentive sample technique that reduces the training cost per epoch
while maintaining accuracy. Through experiments on ImageNet, we demonstrate
that, we can achieve a 2× - 3× (1.5× - 1.8×) reduction in training time compared
to the state of the art OFA and compOFA, respectively, without loss of optimality."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.02097902097902098,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are overwhelmingly successful in many machine learning
applications. These applications may have different inference constraints (e.g., latency) and are de-
ployed in different hardware platforms that range from server-grade platforms to edge devices such
as smartphones. Optimal network architectures need to be designed to meet the requirement for a
target deployment scenario. However, naively designing a specialized architecture for each scenario
is very expensive as it requires to fully retrain the model each time. This is an excessively expensive
process in terms of the required machine learning expertise, time, energy and CO2 emission."
INTRODUCTION,0.027972027972027972,"Recently, researchers have proposed efﬁcient methods which are based on training a super net-
work only once. Then, for a speciﬁc deployment scenario, a sub-network is sampled from the
super-network that meet the deployment constraints with the best accuracy. The weight of the sam-
pled network is shared with original super network, hence retraining is not required. Once-for-all
(OFA) (Cai et al., 2020) is among the ﬁrst methods proposed to tackle this problem. The OFA
method trains a once-for-all network that jointly optimizes the accuracy of a large number of sub-
networks (more than 1019) sampled from the once-for-all network. Each sub-network is selected
from the once-for-all network where layer depths, channel widths, kernel sizes and input resolu-
tion are scaled independently. Such scaling provides a family of CNNs networks with different
computation and representation power to ﬂexibly support deployment under diverse platforms and
conﬁgurations. With this massive search space, OFA co-trains all the sub-networks by a complex
four-stage progressive training process which is prohibitively expensive and costs around 1200 GPU
hours."
INTRODUCTION,0.03496503496503497,"Compound OFA (CompOFA) (Sahni et al., 2020) builds upon the original OFA by shrinking the
design space of possible sub-networks. This is done by only considering networks whose dimensions
are coupled. This reduces the number of possible models by 17 orders of magnitudes, from 1019
down to 243. Sahni et al. (2020) demonstrate that this smaller design space is sufﬁcient, as most"

width,” and “elastic depth” are the phases of training speciﬁed in Cai et al. (2020) that are not used
in CompOFA and fOFA."
INTRODUCTION,0.08391608391608392,"sub-networks in the original OFA design space are far from the optimal accuracy-latency frontier.
With this smaller space, the training procedure can be simpliﬁed as well as these suboptimal sub-
networks are no longer inﬂuencing the training process. CompOFA reduces the four stages of the
original OFA process to two stages, and this optimization speeds up the training time of CompOFA
by a factor of 2× over OFA."
INTRODUCTION,0.09090909090909091,"However, 2× faster than OFA’s 1200 GPU-hours is still 600 GPU-hours. Even with this signiﬁcant
improvement, the training cost remains vary expensive, especially when effects on the environment
are considered (Strubell et al., 2019). While some of this cost can be mitigated by improvements
in hardware efﬁciency and the continued development of specialized platforms for training CNNs,
algorithmic enhancements still have a large role to play. While CompOFA greatly simpliﬁes the pro-
gressive shrinking training procedure used in OFA, it is still dependent on pre-training a supernet-
work to act as a teacher for the sub-network co-training process, which uses knowledge distillation
Hinton et al. (2015). Due to the optimizations in the co-training process, training the supernetwork
in CompOFA requires more than half (180 out of 330) of the total training epochs."
INTRODUCTION,0.0979020979020979,"In this work, we propose several optimizations to the once-for-all training process that produces a
one-stage training algorithm for fast and efﬁcient neural architecture search. The key features of our

INTRODUCTION,0.1048951048951049,"• We co-train all of the sub-networks from scratch without pre-training a teacher network,

RELATED WORK,0.15384615384615385,"Neural architecture search (NAS) aims to automatically ﬁnd the optimal network architecture given
hardware constraints, such as FLOPs or latency. Early NAS works mainly adapted reinforcement
learning (Zoph et al., 2018; Zoph & Le, 2016), evolutionary search (Real et al., 2019; 2017), or
sparse connection learning (Kim et al., 2018) to sample different architectures. However, each
sampled architecture needed to be trained from scratch, resulting in a huge and intractable computing
cost. More recent NAS works greatly reduce the cost by training an over-parameterized network"

as follows:"

TWO-STAGE TRAINING"
TWO-STAGE TRAINING,0.18181818181818182,"The main idea of the two-stage training methods (Berman et al., 2020; Bender et al., 2018; Brock
et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018; Pham et al., 2018) is that after searching for the
best architectures in the ﬁrst stage of training, the best architectures then have to be retrained from
scratch to obtain a ﬁnal model. Generally, a single two-stage search experiment can only target a
single resource budget or a narrow range of resource budgets at a time, which is inefﬁcient."
ONE-STAGE TRAINING,0.1888111888111888,"2.2
ONE-STAGE TRAINING"
ONE-STAGE TRAINING,0.1958041958041958,"To alleviate the inefﬁciency of two-stage training, Once-For-All (OFA) (Cai et al., 2020) was pro-
posed to jointly train various sub-networks of the super-network in a single stage. By doing so,
the sub-networks could be directly deployed into different hardware platform without retraining.
However, to support an extremely large number of sub-networks (i.e., 1019), such one-stage training
involves multi-steps to gradually add more sub-networks by using the proposed progressive shrink-
ing technique. Moreover, OFA also needs to train a single full-sized teacher network (same size
as super-network) from scratch ﬁrstly to guide the training of the sub-networks by using knowl-
edge distillation. Thus, due to the complex training procedure, OFA still suffers from a prohibitive
training cost, requiring around 1200 GPU hours."
ONE-STAGE TRAINING,0.20279720279720279,"More recently, inspired by studies on neural network design spaces (Tan & Le, 2019; Radosavovic
et al., 2020), CompOFA (Sahni et al., 2020) proposes a compound sub-network scaling method,
which couples the depth and width conﬁguration of the sampled sub-networks to constrain the search
space, reducing the space to only 243 number of sub-networks without losing accuracy. Although
CompOFA achieves a 2× training cost reduction compared with OFA, it follows the similar training
procedure that also needs to train a teacher model from scratch. A similar approach is investigated in
Yang et al. (2020), which couples network width and input resolution into a single mutual learning
framework."
ONE-STAGE TRAINING,0.2097902097902098,"In addition, bigNAS (Yu et al., 2020) proposed replacing OFA’s multi-step training by a single step,
namely one-shot NAS, challenging the usual practice of progressive training in OFA. The idea of
the one-shot NAS is to jointly train sub-networks from scratch directly by using the sandwich rule
and in-place distillation techniques proposed for slimmable networks (Yu et al., 2018). Based on
bigNAS, Wang et al. (2020) points out the unnecessary updates on sub-optimal models in one-stage
training, and uses attention mechanisms to push the Pareto front. However, the primary objective of
these two works is to obtain better accuracy, thus still suffer from high training cost, e.g., bigNAS
needs over 2300 TPU hours for O(1012) models. In addition, (Li et al., 2021) works to improve the
trade-off between accuracy and computation complexity based for slimmable networks by introduc-
ing a dynamic gating mechanism and in-place ensemble bootstrapping to increase training stability..
However, it requires a one more gating training step, resulting in larger training cost."
ONE-STAGE TRAINING,0.21678321678321677,"Our approach also follows the direction of the one-shot model. Differentiating from bigNAS, the
primary objective of this work is to reduce the training cost without loss of Pareto optimality under
the design space of OFA and CompOFA."

we sample the ith largest depth wi whenever we sample the ith largest depth di for each layer in

we follow CompOFA and use a ﬁxed kernel size within each block. We call the network where the

TRAINING RESULTS,0.5944055944055944,"For CompOFA and fOFA, the mean top-1 accuracy is computed over all 243 models generated by
the training process. Since OFA has an extremely large number of sub-networks, we calculate this
average by selecting the same 243 models that are used in CompOFA and fOFA. We see that while
CompOFA is 2.0× faster than OFA, with 185 epochs, fOFA is a further 1.55× faster than CompOFA
if we sample four sub-networks during training, and a further 1.83× faster if we sample only three
sub-networks. In both cases, our accuracy is equal to OFA and 0.1% greater than CompOFA. If
we sample four sub-networks and extend our training time to approximately match the number of
GPU-hours required for CompOFA, we generate an average accuracy 0.1% greater than OFA."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.6993006993006993,"Figure 4 shows the trade-off between model accuracy and number of ﬂoating-point operations for
compOFA and fOFA with n = 4. On average, fOFA is ∼0.1% more accurate that CompOFA,
as listed in Table 2, and achieves greater accuracy on models with lower FLOP counts, agreeing
with results in Tables 3-5. Despite replacing the sandwich rule with upper-attentive sampling, the
smallest model in the search space has 0.9% greater accuracy in fOFA."
DISCUSSION,0.7062937062937062,"We also ran fOFA using the sandwich rule (Yu & Huang (2019)) on the same hyperparameter space.
With the sandwich rule, the average accuracy over the search space was 0.3% lower than with upper-
attentive sampling. Furthermore, the decrease in accuracy was greater on models with higher FLOP
counts, and less on models with lower FLOP counts. To explain these observations, we note that the
upper bound of the CompOFA search space is signiﬁcant lower than that of the MobileNetv2 search
space from Yu et al. (2020). In BigNAS, the largest model in the search space required 1.8 GFLOPs
while the largest output model, BigNASModel-XL, required only 1.04 GFLOPs. In contrast, the
largest model in the CompOFA search space uses 447 MFLOPs and the models we selected for
GPU deployment in Table 4 approach this upper limit."

DISCUSSION,0.7622377622377622,"found that this results in the average accuracy decreasing to 74.8%. From this result, we propose
that an overly large teacher model, while providing a higher upper bound on accuracy, may not be
as effective for training smaller submodels, and that when the teacher model is closer in size to the
submodels, upper-attentive sampling is sufﬁcient to achieve good accuracy throughout the search
space."
DISCUSSION,0.7692307692307693,"When upper-attentive sampling is used in combination with in-place distillation, the warm-up phase
is essential so that the initial target for sub-model training is better than random. After ﬁve epochs of
warm-up, the teacher model has an accuracy of 47.42% in our experiments, providing a reasonable
starting point for training. In OFA and CompOFA, this warmup phase is not needed because the
teacher model is already fully trained."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.7832167832167832,"In this work, we introduce fast once-for-all (fOFA) and demonstrate how this methodology can
reduce expensive training cost for neural architecture search below 200 GPU-hours. This is done
by combining the approaches of CompOFA (Sahni et al., 2020) and BigNAS (Yu et al., 2020) by
using a reduced state space to only consider models close to the Pareto-optimum, as in CompOFA,
and using in-place distillation, as in BigNAS, to eliminate the requirement of expensive teacher
training from OFA. While these methods work well together, to achieve optimal performance it was
necessary to develop methods such as upper attentive sampling and apply a warmup phase to achieve
optimal results. Our results show that we can achieve the same accuracy as OFA with a speed-up of
3.1×-3.7×, and similar accuracy to CompOFA with a speed-up of 1.5×-1.8×."
CONCLUSION,0.7902097902097902,"As we continue this work, we look to further investigate the relationships between training heuristics
and the choice of the network search space, so that we can better understand the theoretical reasons
for their performance and determine which methods lead to most efﬁcient training. We also hope
to further investigate multiple network search spaces to develop new methods for ﬁnding training
schedules and network sampling approaches that optimize accuracy for both benchmark tasks such
as Imagenet classiﬁcation and novel tasks such as segmentation, detection, and transfer learning."
