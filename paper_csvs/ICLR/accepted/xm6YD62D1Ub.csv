ABSTRACT,0.002785515320334262,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.005571030640668524,"Recent self-supervised methods for image representation learning maximize the
agreement between embedding vectors produced by encoders fed with different
views of the same image. The main challenge is to prevent a collapse in which
the encoders produce constant or non-informative vectors. We introduce VICReg
(Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization), a method that explicitly avoids
the collapse problem with two regularizations terms applied to both embeddings
separately: (1) a term that maintains the variance of each embedding dimension
above a threshold, (2) a term that decorrelates each pair of variables. Unlike
most other approaches to the same problem, VICReg does not require techniques
such as: weight sharing between the branches, batch normalization, feature-wise
normalization, output quantization, stop gradient, memory banks, etc., and achieves
results on par with the state of the art on several downstream tasks. In addition, we
show that our variance regularization term stabilizes the training of other methods
and leads to performance improvements."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.011142061281337047,"Self-supervised representation learning has made signiﬁcant progress over the last years, almost
reaching the performance of supervised baselines on many downstream tasks Bachman et al. (2019);
Misra & Maaten (2020); He et al. (2020); Tian et al. (2020); Caron et al. (2020); Grill et al. (2020);
Chen & He (2020); Gidaris et al. (2021); Zbontar et al. (2021). Several recent approaches rely on
a joint embedding architecture in which two networks are trained to produce similar embeddings
for different views of the same image. A popular instance is the Siamese network architecture
Bromley et al. (1994), where the two networks share the same weights. The main challenge with
joint embedding architectures is to prevent a collapse in which the two branches ignore the inputs and
produce identical and constant output vectors. There are two main approaches to preventing collapse:
contrastive methods and information maximization methods. Contrastive Bromley et al. (1994);
Chopra et al. (2005); He et al. (2020); Hjelm et al. (2019); Chen et al. (2020a) methods tend to be
costly, require large batch sizes or memory banks, and use a loss that explicitly pushes the embeddings
of dissimilar images away from each other. They often require a mining procedure to search for
offending dissimilar samples from a memory bank He et al. (2020) or from the current batch Chen
et al. (2020a). Quantization-based approaches Caron et al. (2020; 2018) force the embeddings of
different samples to belong to different clusters on the unit sphere. Collapse is prevented by ensuring
that the assignment of samples to clusters is as uniform as possible. A similarity term encourages
the cluster assignment score vectors from the two branches to be similar. More recently, a few
methods have appeared that do not rely on contrastive samples or vector quantization, yet produce
high-quality representations, for example BYOL Grill et al. (2020) and SimSiam Chen & He (2020).
They exploit several tricks: batch-wise or feature-wise normalization, a ""momentum encoder"" in
which the parameter vector of one branch is a low-pass-ﬁltered version of the parameter vector of the
other branch Grill et al. (2020); Richemond et al. (2020), or a stop-gradient operation in one of the
branches Chen & He (2020). The dynamics of learning in these methods, and how they avoid collapse,
is not fully understood, although theoretical and empirical studies point to the crucial importance
of batch-wise or feature-wise normalization Richemond et al. (2020); Tian et al. (2021). Finally, an"

regularization. Given a batch of images I, two batches of different views X and X′ are produced

minimized, the variance of each embedding variable over a batch is maintained above a threshold, and
the covariance between pairs of embedding variables over a batch are attracted to zero, decorrelating
the variables from each other. Although the two branches do not require identical architectures nor

collapse by decorrelating every pair of variables of the embedding vectors. This indirectly maximizes
the information content of the embedding vectors. The Barlow Twins method drives the normalized
cross-correlation matrix of the two embeddings towards the identity Zbontar et al. (2021), while the
Whitening-MSE method whitens and spreads out the embedding vectors on the unit sphere Ermolov

VICREG: INTUITION"
INTRODUCTION,0.055710306406685235,"We introduce VICReg (Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization), a self-supervised method for
training joint embedding architectures based on the principle of preserving the information content of
the embeddings. The basic idea is to use a loss function with three terms:"
INTRODUCTION,0.0584958217270195,• Invariance: the mean square distance between the embedding vectors.
INTRODUCTION,0.06128133704735376,"• Variance: a hinge loss to maintain the standard deviation (over a batch) of each variable of
the embedding above a given threshold. This term forces the embedding vectors of samples
within a batch to be different."
INTRODUCTION,0.06406685236768803,"• Covariance: a term that attracts the covariances (over a batch) between every pair of
(centered) embedding variables towards zero. This term decorrelates the variables of each
embedding and prevents an informational collapse in which the variables would vary
together or be highly correlated."
INTRODUCTION,0.06685236768802229,"Variance and Covariance terms are applied to both branches of the architecture separately, thereby
preserving the information content of each embedding at a certain level and preventing informational
collapse independently for the two branches. The main contribution of this paper is the Variance
preservation term, which explicitly prevents a collapse due to a shrinkage of the embedding vectors
towards zero. The Covariance criterion is borrowed from the Barlow Twins method and prevents
informational collapse due to redundancy between the embedding variables Zbontar et al. (2021).
VICReg is more generally applicable than most of the aforementioned methods because of fewer
constraints on the architecture. In particular, VICReg:"
INTRODUCTION,0.06963788300835655,"• does not require that the weights of the two branches be shared, not that the architectures be
identical, nor that the inputs be of the same nature;"
INTRODUCTION,0.07242339832869081,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
INTRODUCTION,0.07520891364902507,"• does not require a memory bank, nor contrastive samples, nor a large batch size;
• does not require batch-wise nor feature-wise normalization; and
• does not require vector quantization nor a predictor module."
INTRODUCTION,0.07799442896935933,"Other methods require asymmetric stop gradient operations, as in SimSiam Chen & He (2020),
weight sharing between the two branches as in classical Siamese nets, or weight sharing through
exponential moving average dampening with stop gradient in one branch, as in BYOL and MoCo He
et al. (2020); Grill et al. (2020); Chen et al. (2020c), large batches of contrastive samples, as in
SimCLR Chen et al. (2020a), or batch-wise and/or feature-wise normalization Caron et al. (2020);
Grill et al. (2020); Chen & He (2020); Zbontar et al. (2021); Ermolov et al. (2021). One of the
most interesting feature of VICReg is the fact that the two branches are not required to share the
same parameters, architecture, or input modality. This opens the door to the use of non-contrastive
self-supervised joint-embedding for multi-modal signals, such as video and audio. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach by evaluating the representations learned with VICReg on
several downstream image recognition tasks including linear head and semi-supervised evaluation
protocols for image classiﬁcation on ImageNet Deng et al. (2009), and other classiﬁcation, detec-
tion, instance segmentation, and retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we show that incorporating variance
preservation into other self-supervised joint-embedding methods yields better training stability and
performance improvement on downstream tasks. More generally, we show that VICReg is an explicit
and effective, yet simple method for preventing collapse in self-supervised joint-embedding learning."

output embeddings for a sample and its distorted version are brought close to each other, while
other samples and their distortions are pushed away. The method is most often applied to Siamese
architectures in which the two branches have identical architectures and share weights Misra &

(2020b). Many authors use the InfoNCE loss van den Oord et al. (2018) in which the repulsive force
is larger for contrastive samples that are closer to the reference. While these methods yield good
performance, they require large amounts of contrastive pairs in order to work well. These contrastive
pairs can be sampled from a memory bank as in MoCo He et al. (2020), or given by the current batch
of data as in SimCLR Chen et al. (2020a), with a signiﬁcant memory footprint. This downside of
contrastive methods motivates a search for alternatives."
RELATED WORK,0.08635097493036212,"Clustering methods. Instead of viewing each sample as its own class, clustering-based methods
group them into clusters based on some similarity measure Caron et al. (2020; 2018); Bautista et al.

et al. (2019); Asano et al. (2020); Yan et al. (2020). DeepCluster Caron et al. (2018) uses k-means
assignments of representations from previous iterations as pseudo-labels for the new representations,
which requires an expensive clustering phase done asynchronously, and makes the method hard
to scale up. SwAV Caron et al. (2020) mitigates this issue by learning the clusters online while
maintaining a balanced partition of the assignments through the Sinkhorn-Knopp transform Cuturi
(2013). These clustering approaches can be viewed as contrastive learning at the level of clusters
which still requires a lot of negative comparisons to work well."

shown that collapse can be avoided by using architectural tricks inspired by knowledge distillation
Hinton et al. (2015). These methods train a student network to predict the representations of a
teacher network, for which the weights are a running average of the student network’s weights Grill
et al. (2020), or are shared with the student network, but no gradient is back-propagated through
the teacher Chen & He (2020). These methods are effective, but there is no clear understanding
of why and how they avoid collapse. Alternatively, the images can be represented as bags of word
over a dictionary of visual features, which effectively prevents collapse. In OBoW Gidaris et al.
(2020) and Gidaris et al. (2021) the dictionary is obtained by off-line or on-line clustering. By
contrast, our method explicitly prevents collapse in the two branches independently, which removes"

RELATED WORK,0.09749303621169916,"Information maximization methods. A principle to prevent collapse is to maximize the information
content of the embeddings. Two such methods were recently proposed: W-MSE Ermolov et al. (2021)
and Barlow Twins Zbontar et al. (2021). In W-MSE, an extra module transforms the embeddings
into the eigenspace of their covariance matrix (whitening or Karhunen-Loève transform), and forces
the vectors thereby obtained to be uniformly distributed on the unit sphere. In Barlow Twins, a loss
term attempts to make the normalized cross-correlation matrix of the embedding vectors from the
two branches to be close to the identity. Both methods attempt to produce embedding variables that
are decorrelated from each other, thus preventing an informational collapse in which the variables
carry redundant information. Because all variables are normalized over a batch, there is no incentive
for them to shrink nor expand. This seems to sufﬁcient to prevent collapse. Our method borrows the
decorrelation mechanism of Barlow Twins. But it includes an explicit variance-preservation term for
each variable of the two embeddings and thus does not require any normalization."

VICREG: DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
RELATED WORK,0.10306406685236769,"VICReg follows recent trends in self-supervised learning Caron et al. (2020); Grill et al. (2020);
Chen & He (2020); Zbontar et al. (2021); Chen et al. (2020a) and is based on a joint embedding
architecture. Contrary to many previous approaches, our architecture may be completely symmetric
or completely asymmetric with no shared structure or parameters between the two branches. In
most of our experiments, we use a Siamese net architecture in which the two branches are identical
and share weights. Each branch consists of an encoder fθ that outputs the representations (used for
downstream tasks), followed by an expander hφ that maps the representations into an embedding
space where the loss function will be computed. The role of the expander is twofold: (1) eliminate
the information by which the two representations differ, (2) expand the dimension in a non-linear
fashion so that decorrelating the embedding variables will reduce the dependencies (not just the
correlations) between the variables of the representation vector. The loss function uses a term s that
learns invariance to data transformations and is regularized with a variance term v that prevents norm
collapse and a covariance term c that prevents informational collapse by decorrelating the different
dimensions of the vectors. After pretraining, the expander is discarded and the representations of the
encoder are used for downstream tasks."

Appendix C. The views x and x′ are ﬁrst encoded by fθ into their representations y = fθ(x) and

expander hφ is composed of two fully-connected layers with batch normalization (BN) Ioffe &
Szegedy (2015) and ReLU, and a third linear layer. The sizes of all 3 layers were set to 8192. As
with Barlow Twins, performance improves when the size of the expander layers is larger than the
dimension of the representation. The impact of the expander dimension on performance is studied in
Appendix D. The training protocol follows those of BYOL and Barlow Twins: LARS optimizer You

rate lr = batch_size/256 × base_lr, where batch_size is set to 2048 by default and base_lr is a

shows that VICReg is a very stable algorithm. Lack of time has prevented us from doing the same
for the semi-supervised classiﬁcation experiments, and the experiments of section 5.2 and 6, but
we expect similar conclusion to hold. We compare in Table 1 our results on both tasks against
other methods on the validation set of ImageNet. The performance of VICReg is on par with the
state of the art without using the negative pairs of SimCLR, the clusters of SwAV, the bag-of-words
representations of OBoW, or any asymmetric networks architectural tricks such as the momentum
encoder of BYOL and the stop-gradient operation of SimSiam. The performance is comparable to
that of Barlow Twins, which shows that VICReg’s more explicit way of constraining the variance
and comparing views has the same power than maximizing cross-correlations between pairs of twin
dimensions. The main advantage of VICReg is the modularity of its objective function and the
applicability to multi-modal setups."

MULTI-MODAL PRETRAINING ON MS-COCO,0.23676880222841226,"One fundamental difference of VICReg compared to Barlow Twins is the way the branches are
regularized. In VICReg, both branches are regularized independently, as the covariance term is
applied on each branch separately, which works better in the scenarios where the branches are
completely different, have different types of architecture and process different types of data. Indeed,
the statistics of the output of the two branches can be very different, and the amount of regularization
required for each may vary a lot. In Barlow Twins, the regularization is applied on the cross-correlation
matrix, which favors the scenarios where the branches produce outputs with similar statistics. We
demonstrate the capabilities of VICReg in a multi-modal experiment where we pretrain on pairs of
images and corresponding captions on the MS-COCO dataset. We regularize each branch with a
different coefﬁcient, which is not possible with Barlow Twins, and we show that VICReg outperforms
Barlow Twins on image and text retrieval downstream tasks. Table 3 reports the performance of
VICReg against the contrastive loss proposed by VSE++ Faghri et al. (2018), and against Barlow
Twins, in the identical setting proposed in Faghri et al. (2018). VICReg outperforms the two by a

as well as how they interact with components from other self-supervised methods. We also evaluate
different scenarios where the branches have different weights and architecture. All reported results are
obtained on the linear evaluation protocol, using a ResNet-50 backbone if not mentioned otherwise,
and 100 epochs of pretraining, which gives results consistent with those obtained with 1000 epochs
of pretraining. The optimization setting used for each experiment is described in Appendix C."
ANALYSIS,0.2562674094707521,"Asymmetric networks. We study the impact of different components used in asymmetric architec-
tures and the effects of adding variance and covariance regularization, in terms of performance and
training stability. Starting from a simple symmetric architecture with an encoder and an expander
without batch normalization, which correspond to VICReg without batch normalization in the ex-
pander, we progressively add batch normalization in the inner layers of the expander, a predictor, a
stop-gradient operation and a momentum encoder. We use the training protocol and architecture of
SimSiam Chen & He (2020) when a stop-gradient is used and the training protocol and architecture
of BYOL Grill et al. (2020) when a momentum encoder is used. The predictor as used in SimSiam
and BYOL is a learnable module gψ that predicts the embedding of a view given the embedding of
the other view of the same image. If z and z′ are the embeddings of two views of an image, then
p = gψ(z) and p′ = gψ(z′) are the predictions of each view. The invariance loss function of Eq. (5)

the mean square error without l2-normalization. The variance and covariance terms are regularizing
the output Z and Z′ of the expander, which we empirically found to work better than regularizing
the output of the predictor. We compare different settings in Table 4, based on the default data
augmentation, optimization and architecture settings of the original BYOL, SimSiam and VICReg

one is used."

both stop-gradient (SG) and PR are necessary. Batch normalization in the inner layers of the expander

N,0.28969359331476324,"Finally, incorporating VR with SG or ME further improves the performance by small margins of
respectively 0.2% and 0.9%, which might be explained by the fact that these architectural tricks that
prevent collapse are not perfectly maintaining the variance of the representations, i.e. very slow
collapse is happening with these methods. We explain this intuition by studying the evolution of the
standard deviation of the representations during pretraining for BYOL and SimSiam in Appendix D.
We then analyse the impact of adding additional covariance regularization (CR) in the different
settings, along with variance regularization. We found that optimization with SG and CR is hard,
even if our analysis of the average correlation coefﬁcient of the representations during pretraining in
Appendix D shows that both fulﬁll the same objective."

removed, where SG becomes useless. BN is still useful and improves the performance by 1.3%.
Finally with CR, PR does not harm the performance and even improves it by a very small margin.
VICReg+PR with 1000 epochs of pretraining exactly matches the score of VICReg (73.2% on linear
classiﬁcation)."
N,0.29526462395543174,"Weight sharing. Contrary to most self-supervised learning approaches based on Siamese archi-
tectures, VICReg has several unique properties: (1) weights do not need to be shared between the
branches, each branch’s weights are updated independently of the other branch’s weights; (2) the
branches are regularized independently, the variance and covariance terms are computed on each
branch individually; (3) no predictor is necessary unlike with methods where one branch predicts
outputs of the other branch. We compare the robustness of VICReg against other methods in different
scenarios where the weights of the branches can be shared (SW), not shared (DW), and where the
encoders can have different architectures (DA). Among other self-supervised methods, SimCLR and
Barlow Twins are the only ones that can handle these scenarios. The asymmetric methods that are
based on a discrepancy between the branches requires either the architecture or the weights to be
shared between the branches. The performance drops by 2.1% with VICReg and 4.5% with Barlow
Twins, between the shared weights scenario (SW) and the different weight scenario (DW). The differ-
ence between VICReg and Barlow Twins is also signiﬁcant in scenarios with different architectures,
in particular VICReg performs better than Barlow Twins by 2.8% with ResNet-50/ResNet-101 and
better by 2.3% with ResNet-50/ViT-S Dosovitskiy et al. (2021). This shows that VICReg is more
robust than Barlow Twins in these kind of scenarios. The performance of SimCLR remains stable
across scenarios, but is signiﬁcantly worse than the performance of VICReg. Importantly, the abil-
ity of VICReg to function with different parameters, architectures, and input modalities for
the branches widens the applicability to joint-embedding SSL to many applications, including
multi-modal signals."

CONCLUSION,0.3008356545961003,"We introduced VICReg, a simple approach to self-supervised learning based on a triple objective:
learning invariance to different views with a invariance term, avoiding collapse of the representations
with a variance preservation term, and maximizing the information content of the representation
with a covariance regularization term. VICReg achieves results on par with the state of the art on
many downstream tasks, but is not subject to the same limitations as most other methods, particularly
because it does not require the embedding branches to be identical or even similar."

RELATION TO OTHER SELF-SUPERVISED METHODS"
REFERENCES,0.532033426183844,"We compare here VICReg with other methods in terms of methodology, and we discuss the mecha-
nisms used by these methods to avoid collapse and to learn representations, and how they relate to
VICReg. We synthesize and illustrate the differences between these methods in Figure 2."
REFERENCES,0.5348189415041783,"Relation to Barlow Twins Zbontar et al. (2021). VICReg uses the same decorrelation mechanism as
Barlow Twins, which consists in penalizing the off-diagonal terms of a covariance matrix computed
on the embeddings. However, Barlow Twins uses the cross-correlation matrix where each entry in the
matrix is a cross-correlation between two vectors zi and z′j, from the two branches of the siamese
architecture. Instead of using cross-correlations, we simply use the covariance matrix of each branch
individually, and the variance term of VICReg allows us to get rid of standardization. Indeed, Barlow
Twins forces the correlations between pairs of vectors zi and z′i from the same dimension i to be 1.
Without normalization, this target value of 1 becomes arbitrary and the vectors take values in a wider
range. Moreover, there is an undesirable phenomenon happening in Barlow Twins, the embeddings
before standardization can shrink and become constant to numerical precision, which could cause
numerical instabilities. In practice, this is solved by adding a constant scalar in the denominator of
standardization of the embeddings. Without normalization, VICReg naturally avoids this edge case."
REFERENCES,0.5376044568245125,"Relation to W-MSE Ermolov et al. (2021). The whitening operation of W-MSE consists in comput-
ing the inverse covariance matrix of the embeddings and use its square root as a whitening operator
on the embeddings. Using this operator has two downsides. First, matrix inversion is a very costly
and potentially unstable operation. VICReg does not need to inverse the covariance matrix. Second,
as mentioned in Ermolov et al. (2021) the whitening operator is constructed over several consecutive
iteration batches and therefore might have a high variance, which biases the estimation of the mean-
squared error. This issue is overcome in practice by a batch slicing strategy, where the whitening
operator is computed over randomly constructed sub-batches. VICReg does not apply any operator
on the embeddings, but instead regularizes the variance and covariance of the embeddings using an
additional constraint."
REFERENCES,0.5403899721448467,"Relation to BYOL and SimSiam Grill et al. (2020); Chen & He (2020). The core components
that avoid collapse in BYOL and SimSiam are the average moving weights and the stop-gradient
operation on one side of their asymmetric architecture, which play the role of the repulsive term used
in other methods. Our experiments in Appendix D.8 show that in addition to preventing collapse,
these components also have a decorrelation effect. In addition, we have conducted the following
experiment: We compute the correlation matrix of the ﬁnal representations obtained with SimSiam,
BYOL, VICReg and VICReg without covariance regularization. We measure the average correlation
coefﬁcient and observe that this coefﬁcient is much smaller for SimSiam, BYOL and VICReg,
compared to VICReg without covariance regularization. We observe in Figure 5 that even without
covariance regularization, SimSiam and BYOL naturally minimize the average correlation coefﬁcient
of the representations. VICReg replaces the moving average weights and the stop-gradient operation,
which are architectural trick that require some dependency between the branches, by an explicit
constraint on the variance and the covariance of both embeddings separately, which achieves the
same goal of decorrelating the representations and avoiding collapse, while being clearer, more
interpretable, and working with independent branches."
REFERENCES,0.5431754874651811,"Relation to SimCLR, SwAV and OBoW Caron et al. (2020); Chen et al. (2020a); Gidaris et al.
(2021). Contrastive and clustering based self-supervised algorithms rely on direct comparisons
between elements of negative pairs. In the case of SimCLR, the negative pairs involve embeddings
mined from the current batch, and large batch sizes are required. Despite the fact that SwAV
computes clusters using elements in the current batch, it does not seem to have the same dependency
on batch size. However, it still requires a lot of prototype vectors for negative comparisons between
embeddings and codes. VICReg eliminates the negative comparisons and replace them by an explicit
constraint on the variance of the embeddings, which efﬁciently plays the role of a negative term
between the vectors. SwAV can also be interpreted as a distillation method, where a teacher network
produces quantized vectors, used as target for a student network. Ensuring an equal partition of
the quantized vectors in different bins or clusters effectively prevents collapse. OBOW can also be
interpreted under the same framework. The embeddings are bag-of-words over a vocabulary of visual
features, and collapse is avoided by the underlying quantization operation."

network h with weights ψ. h can be a projector (narrowing trapeze) that reduces the dimensionality
of the representations, or an expander (widening trapeze) that increases their dimensionality. A
criterion is ﬁnally applied on the embeddings Z and Z′. VICReg (a) works when both branches have
encoders f and f ′ with different architectures and sets of weights θ and θ′. Each branch’s variance
and covariance are regularized by regularizers v and c, and the distance between both branches is
minimized with a mean-squared error loss s. Barlow Twins (b) uses a loss c to decorrelate pairs of
different dimensions in the batch-wise normalized (B-Norm) embeddings, and learns invariance with
a loss i that makes similar dimensions highly correlated. W-MSE (c) uses a batch slicing operation
that shufﬂes batches into small sub-batches, and apply PCA as a whitening operation on the feature-
wise normalized (F-Norm) embeddings of each sub-batch. BYOL (d) has an asymmetric architecture
where the weights θm of one encoder are an exponential moving average (ema) of the other encoder’s
weights θ. A predictor g with weights ψ is used in the branch with learnable weights. SimSiam

uses the InfoNCE contrastive loss where all the feature-wise normalized embeddings are compared
between them inside a batch. Samples from distorted versions of the same input are brought close to
each other, while other samples are pushed away. SwAV (g) quantizes the feature-wise normalized
embeddings of a branch and use it as target for the other one. OBoW (h) uses bag-of-words (BoW)

We focus on the wider family of ResNet Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016) and aggregated ResNet Xie

practice in recent self-supervised learning work Caron et al. (2020); Grill et al. (2020); Chen et al.
(2020a) and multiple by 2 or 4 the number of ﬁlters in every convolutional layer, which also has the
effect of multiplying the dimensionality of the representations. Second, as originally proposed in
Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016), we only multiply the number of ﬁlters in the bottleneck layers,
which does not increases the dimensionality of the representations. We call this architecture Narrow
ResNet (with preﬁx N- in Table 9). The main observation we make is the dependency of VICReg on
the dimensionality of the representation. Using the narrow architecture, the performance of VICReg,
jumps from 73.2% top-1 accuracy on linear classiﬁcation with a ResNet-50, to 74.7% with Narrow
ResNet-50 (x2), which is a 1.5% improvement and 76.0% with Narrow ResNet-50 (x4), which is a

2.3% improvement but the performance completely saturates with ResNet-50 (x4), which is a 0.1%
