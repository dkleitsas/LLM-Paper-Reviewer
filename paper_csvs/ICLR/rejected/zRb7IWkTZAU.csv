ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.007142857142857143,"Rewards in reinforcement learning are difﬁcult to design for most tasks and often
require access to underlying state information. The alternatives to reward signals
are usually demonstrations or goal images which can be labor-intensive to collect.
Describing the goal as a text description is a low effort way of communicating the
desired task to an agent. However, goal-text conditioned policies so far have been
trained in scenarios either with rewards that assume access to states or with labeled
expert demonstrations. In this work, we devise a model that leverages CLIP to
ground objects in a scene described by the goal-text paired with spatial relationship
rules to provide an off-the-shelf reward signal using only raw pixels as input. We
distill the policies learned with this reward signal on several tasks to obtain a single
text conditioned policy that can be applied to solve new tasks at deployment. We
show the effectiveness of this framework on a set of robotic manipulation tasks."

INTRODUCTION,0.08571428571428572,"Figure 1: We devise a method that learns tasks using
only goal text from user and images from the envi-
ronment at training time. We train several agents on
several tasks and distill their policies into a multi-task
policy that is conditioned on goal text and current ob-
servation. The distilled policy is able to generalize to
new unseen tasks at test time. We assume no access
to environment reward, state, demonstrations, or goal
images."
INTRODUCTION,0.09285714285714286,"Previous efforts have explored image-based goal
speciﬁcation, with signiﬁcant successes in visual
navigation and manipulation tasks (Pathak et al.,
2018; Nair et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2018; Singh et al.,
2019). Yet existing image-based goal speciﬁca-
tion paradigms are limited because they are typ-
ically limited to a particular scene instance in an
environment, whereas a semantic goal comprises
multiple possible scene conﬁgurations. Reinforce-
ment learning offers one of the most appealing
premises in the study of AI: from a reward signal
alone, algorithms which learn optimal policies that
maximize expected reward can learn to perform
navigation, dexterous manipulation, and host of
other impactful tasks. However, discovering or
specifying a reward function for a given task is
often a very challenging problem, especially when
one is considering agents that can learn from un-
instrumented environments, e.g., from raw image
observations alone. We wish to have an agent
that can learn purely from pixels, with no access
to the underlying state of the environment at any
point during learning or task execution. Achieving
this goal without access to an instrumented reward
function has been exceedingly challenging."
INTRODUCTION,0.1,"One can use image-based reward speciﬁcation to
cause a robot agent to navigate to a particular chair

potentially a very expensive undertaking to collect or generate."
INTRODUCTION,0.17857142857142858,"We advocate semantic reward speciﬁcation via grounded natural language, where a user describes a
goal conﬁguration in the world using a natural language description referring to entities in the world.
This direction has long been a “holy grail” of AI research and a presumed capability of AI science
ﬁction—the ability to instruct a robot with natural language—yet attempts have been limited by the
state of the art in grounded language perception. It also falls under the general umbrella of leveraging
large-scale passive data to bootstrap embodied learning, where we rely on language as a means to
provide necessary reward shaping missing in visual data alone."
INTRODUCTION,0.18571428571428572,"Several previous efforts train reward functions or policies that take natural language as input for goal
description (Oh et al., 2017; Bahdanau et al., 2018; Zhou & Small, 2020; Goyal et al., 2020; Fu et al.,
2019; Hermann et al., 2017; Shao et al., 2020). They all however rely on reward signals that have
access to state of the system or demonstrations of the task distribution they are training on. There are
works that use human videos to learn reward functions to train their agent with (Shao et al., 2020;
Sermanet et al., 2018; 2016), but they require a curated dataset of humans performing the tasks."
INTRODUCTION,0.19285714285714287,"Recently however, the advent of large-scale multimodal training data together with large capacity
language and vision deep learning models has signiﬁcantly advanced the state of the art. A steady
series of innovations have advanced grounded language modeling, from early work on multimodal
translation and fusion models (Barnard et al., 2003; Quattoni et al., 2007; Guadarrama et al., 2016),
to large-scale joint embedding models (Frome et al., 2013; Radford et al., 2021), to the plethora
of multimodal transformer models currently under investigation (Su et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2019;
Chen et al., 2019; Hu & Singh, 2021). CLIP, in particular, demonstrated a transformative advance on
zero-shot object recognition (Radford et al., 2021)."
INTRODUCTION,0.2,"We could specify a goal state to a robot by simply offering a description of the goal conﬁguration
in natural language and using the CLIP embedding dot product with an observed image to evaluate
proximity to goal state. Surprisingly, this can work in simple cases, for examples see the top example
in Figure 5. But for more complex goals performance can be poor, especially with complex captioned
scenes involving spatial relationships and on domains that differ from web images (as shown in
(Radford et al., 2021)) and the bottom example in that ﬁgure."

of goal state (Figure 2), and offer a novel spatial-salience scheme for the former. We argue that

simply computes reward by taking a dot product between the goal language input feature and image

METHOD,0.2785714285714286,"CLIP-Saliency for Phrase Grounding
We have developed a simple method which factors phrase
grounding and spatial relationship processing, which can be used to specify a reward function that
operates only on image content using a natural language description. Figure 2 illustrates our full
model leverages CLIP’s encoders in a very different way than the base model. Our model ﬁrst
parses the goal language description g into object noun phrases go1...gok and the desired object
interaction. The object noun phrases are passed through CLIP’s language encoder and the current
image observation is passed through CLIP’s image encoder. We use the language encodings as class
embeddings of each object noun phrase to perform a saliency analysis (using Grad-CAM (Selvaraju
et al., 2017)) on the image encoding of the observation on the last convolutional layer (speciﬁcally,
the ReLU layer of CLIP’s ResNet-50 backbone). Saliency models such as Grad-CAM generally
output a heatmap of the features that indicate a class exists in the current image input. The state
extractor in Figure 2 computes the “state” of each object using the argmax of the saliency heatmap.
See Figure 3."

closer to another object in two orthogonal directions at once where as a left only or front view only
allows you to determine one dimension of closeness. For “inside of” a 45 degree camera helps the
agent see if the object is going inside another object without occlusion. The ϵ threshold for “inside of”

product increases except for the closest image where it dips which results in an undesired output.
We observed through these two goal descriptions and many others that the base reward model is not

for computing reward, but has only been successful for videogames such as Atari and Mario or
Locomotion where exploring new states leads to progressing through the task (going further in levels
of game for example). It is less privileged however, in that it does not use language input for task

FULL ZERO-SHOT REWARD MODEL RESULTS,0.5071428571428571,"Curiosity learns the pushing pucks close together task but then starts learning separation of the pucks
which reemphasizes that curiosity is only useful for tasks where exploring new dynamics leads to
going farther in the task. Curiosity also has some trouble learning the double inverted pendulum task
because the dynamics of the pendulum swinging can be hard to predict and therefore have misleading
higher reward. Curiosity also does not learn the other manipulation tasks (stacking and placing) as
those are more complex tasks that are harder to reach by exploration. For Double inverted pendulum
(Fig. 4) our base reward model does better than oracle by chance which we speculate is because the
oracle reward was originally designed for state input and was not tuned for learning image to reward
mapping. Our base reward model fails for pushing, stacking, and placing, which take “an image of a
yellow block on top of a red block”, “an image of a yellow object close to a blue object”, and “an
image of a yellow block on the right of a red block” as language input for those tasks respectively.
For pushing, stacking, and placing our full reward model performs almost as well as oracle sparse
reward which has privileged access to state."

several timesteps for the policy to move the objects to the correct state. All episodes timeout after 100
timesteps or if the one of the objects falls off the table. In RL training and in policy rollout collection

ambiguity in what task to perform given only an image. However, since the no conditioning model has
been trained across many different object colors going to different target states it has learned general
displacement of blocks to different semantic locations randomly that can sometimes be moved to the
correct semantic location by chance during testing. For the training tasks it has higher performance
than testing tasks since it can memorize to execute some of the training tasks that have almost the
exact same initial states sampled during testing as those in the behavior cloning dataset and thereby
execute correctly as memorized."
MULTI-TASK POLICY RESULTS,0.6285714285714286,"The primitive code conditioned model has much higher performance than the no conditioning model
since it can disambiguate what task it needs to execute. Surprisingly language conditioning performs
signiﬁcantly better than primitive code conditioning in training task performance. We conjecture this
is due to language conditioning being a more structured representation of the task, providing a better
loss manifold from which the model can learn a better perceptual motor representation of the task
distribution. In addition the training tasks are sampling initial states from a continuous distribution
meaning almost no two policy rollouts have the same initial state. So some amount of generalization
needs to be had even in the seen initial state distribution to have high performance on the training
tasks."
MULTI-TASK POLICY RESULTS,0.6357142857142857,"The language conditioned model is signiﬁcantly better in test task performance over the primitive
code conditioning since it can use the language embedding to infer the target task determined by the
goal text description. The primitive code conditioning model has access to the language embedding
only to determine the closest training primitive code to the target task description. It compares the
text description embedding of all the training tasks to the test task text description embedding and
chooses the training task primitive code corresponding to the smallest L2 distance. It’s interesting to
observe that the primitive code conditioning does better than no conditioning on the test task because
the closest primitive code can sometimes lead to a successful execution of the test task since it has
some signal towards the correct task. One such example is that the test goal description task of ”a blue
block on the right of a yellow block” is mapped to the primitive code of the training goal description
task of ”a red block on the right of a yellow block”."
MULTI-TASK POLICY RESULTS,0.6428571428571429,"In Table 2 we also show the same trend in the models performing at double the interval of initial
starting locations of the objects seen at training (unseen intial state distribution): the no conditioning
policy performing the poorest on train and test tasks, the primitive code conditioned model performing
signiﬁcantly better on both, the language conditioned model performing the best at training and test
tasks via its language structured speciﬁcation of tasks."
MULTI-TASK POLICY RESULTS,0.65,"We train the multitask policy with ResNet18 image encoding that is concatenated with CLIP language
encoding both of which are pushed through an fc layer before concatenation. The concatenated
vector is then inserted into two fc layers before predicting actions. We apply an L2 regression loss for
continuous action space. The policy is trained using Adam optimizer with AMS grad with learning
rate of 1e-4. The images are augmented with PyTorch RandomResizedCrop of 0.95 to 1.0 area and
0.98 to 1.02 aspect ratio randomization and resized to original image dimensions of 128x128. All the
multitask models are trained for 300 epochs."

RELATED WORK:"
MULTI-TASK POLICY RESULTS,0.6714285714285714,"Goal conditioned policies
Goal conditioned policies allow the user to specify the agent’s goal.
States (Schaul et al., 2015; Andrychowicz et al., 2017) and Images (Pathak et al., 2018; Nair et al.,
2018; Fu et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019) are one way of specifying goal. However, they assume
that user has access to a photo or state of ﬁnal task given to the agent. We assume no access to goal
images or state to minimize human labor and instrumentation, and use language which provides a
natural form of supervision."
MULTI-TASK POLICY RESULTS,0.6785714285714286,"Goal text conditioned policies
Several previous efforts train reward functions or policies that take
natural language as input for goal description (Oh et al., 2017; Bahdanau et al., 2018; Zhou & Small,
2020; Goyal et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2019; Hermann et al., 2017; Shao et al., 2020). They all however
rely on reward signals that have access to state of the system or demonstrations of the task distribution
they are training on."
MULTI-TASK POLICY RESULTS,0.6857142857142857,"Learning reward functions
There are works that use human videos to learn reward functions to
train their agent with (Sermanet et al., 2018; 2016; Shao et al., 2020). We however, don’t need a
curated dataset of humans performing the tasks we want our agent to train with. Having humans
perform all tasks we are interested in may not scale well with the amount of labor needed for recording
and curating those datasets. CLIP has the advantage of learning a caption model from 400 million
image, text pairs from the publicly available sources on the internet WIT."
MULTI-TASK POLICY RESULTS,0.6928571428571428,"No Environment Reward
There have been recent work on methods that use no reward signal from
the environment to train for speciﬁc tasks. Two notable ones are Curiosity (Pathak et al., 2017) and
DIAYN (Eysenbach et al., 2018). Curiosity has only been successful on video games with discrete
action space and DIYAN has mostly been successful on direct state input. Our method however, can
learn a subset of manipulation tasks in continuous action space on raw pixels and has the advantage
of speciﬁcation from user goal text."
MULTI-TASK POLICY RESULTS,0.7,"Utility of large vision language models in RL
There has been recent work that leveraged CLIP
to do many complex manipulation tasks (Shridhar et al., 2021). They however, have access to labeled
expert demonstrations for training their policy. We assume no access to demonstrations or goal
images at training or test time."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.7142857142857143,"In this work, we presented a method for learning a set of object manipulation tasks without access
to state of the system to compute reward from text goal description alone. Our method doesn’t
use goal images or demonstrations at training time or test time. We devised a zero-shot reward
model that leverages a language vision model (CLIP) that has been trained on a very large dataset of
captioned images on the internet to compute progress (reward) towards a goal text description. We
use this zeroshot-reward model to collect data on many tasks to then supervise a language conditioned
multi-task policy that can execute new tasks without need of extra training."
DISCUSSION,0.7214285714285714,"Our work opens avenues for many directions such as learning spatial relationships from data or
leveraging separate datasets for spatial relationships. Pioneering work along these lines was proposed
in (Guadarrama et al., 2013; Golland et al., 2010), who showed that spatial relationships could be
grounded in a learning-based system. We encourage pursing the integration of these approaches to the
grounding of spatial prepositions with the noun-phrase grounding capability we have demonstrated
based on our CLIP-salience method.Our current method also does not specify state of the system
other than semantic position such as object pose or closed door."
DISCUSSION,0.7285714285714285,"Finally we must address the ethical perils inherent in our leverage of models trained on large-scale
vision and language datasets. Such datasets are well known to suffer from dataset bias that can cause
failure or unintended harm (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018). While the near-term risks appear to be
limited with the robotic applications presently envisioned, practitioners should continuously monitor
systems for bias against underrepresented groups and ensure that robotic systems work across all
socioeconomic domains. Techniques for bias assessment and debiasing should be employed whenever
possible to ensure this remains the case."
