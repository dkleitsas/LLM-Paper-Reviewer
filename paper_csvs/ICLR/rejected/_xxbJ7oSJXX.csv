ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0021645021645021645,"Offline reinforcement learning is used to train policies in scenarios where real-
time access to the environment is expensive or impossible. As a natural conse-
quence of these harsh conditions, an agent may lack the resources to fully observe
the online environment before taking an action. We dub this situation the resource-
constrained setting. This leads to situations where the offline dataset (available
for training) can contain fully processed features (using powerful language mod-
els, image models, complex sensors, etc.) which are not available when actions
are actually taken online. This disconnect leads to an interesting and unexplored
problem in offline RL: Is it possible to use a richly processed offline dataset to
train a policy which has access to fewer features in the online environment?
In this work, we introduce and formalize this novel resource-constrained problem
setting. We highlight the performance gap between policies trained using the full
offline dataset and policies trained using limited features. We advocate the use of
transfer learning to address this performance gap by first training a teacher agent
using the offline dataset where features are fully available, and then transfering this
knowledge to a student agent that only uses the resource-constrained features. We
evaluate the proposed approach on three diverse set of tasks: MuJoCo (continu-
ous control), Atari 2600 (discrete control) and a real life Ads dataset. Our analysis
shows the proposed approach improves over the considered baselines and unlocks
interesting insights. To better capture the challenge of this setting, we also propose
a data collection procedure: Resource Constrained-Datasets for RL (RC-D4RL)."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.006493506493506494,"There have been many recent successes in the field of Reinforcement Learning (Mnih et al., 2013;
Lillicrap et al., 2015; Mnih et al., 2016; Silver et al., 2016; Henderson et al., 2018). In the online RL
setting, an agent takes actions, observes the outcome from the environment, and updates its policy
based on the outcome. This repeated access to the environment is not feasible in practical applica-
tions; it may be unsafe to interact with the actual environment, and a high-fidelity simulator may
be costly to build. Instead, offline RL, consumes fixed training data which consist of recorded inter-
actions between one (or more) agent(s) and the environment to train a policy (Levine et al., 2020).
An agent with the trained policy is then deployed in the environment without further evaluation or
modification. Notice that in offline RL, the deployed agent must consume data in the same format
(for example,having the same features) as in the training data. This is a crippling restriction in many
large-scale applications, where, due to some combination of resource/system constraints, all of the
features used for training cannot be observed (or misspecified) by the agent during online opera-
tion. In this work, we lay the foundations for studying this Resource-Constrained setting for offline
RL. We then provide an algorithm that improves performance by transferring information from the
full-featured offline training set to the deployed agent’s policy acting on limited features. We first
illustrate a few practical cases where resource-constrained settings emerge."
INTRODUCTION,0.008658008658008658,"System Latency A deployed agent is often constrained by how much time it has to process the state
of the environment and make a decision. For example, in a customer-facing web application, the
customer will start to lose interest within a fraction of a second. Given this constraint, the agent
may not be able to fully process more than a few measurements from the customer before making a
decision. This is in contrast to the process of recording the training data for offline RL, where one"

INTRODUCTION,0.03463203463203463,"Power Constraints Consider a situation where an RL agent is being used in deep space probes or
nano-satellites ((Deshmukh et al., 2018)). In this case an RL agent is trained on Earth with rich
features and a large amount of sensory information. But when the agent is deployed and being used
on these probes, the number of sensors is limited by power and space constraints. Similarly, consider
a robot deployed in a real world environment. The limited compute power of the robot prevents it
from using powerful feature extractors while making a decision. However, such powerful feature
extractors can be used during the offline training of the robot (Fig 1a)."
INTRODUCTION,0.0367965367965368,"In the resource-constrained setting, one can simply ignore the offline features and only train the of-
fline agent with the online features that are available during deployment. This strategy has the draw-
back of not utilizing all of the information available during training and can lead to a sub-optimal
policy. To confirm this, we performed the following simple experiment. We consider an offline
RL dataset for the OpenAI gym MuJoCo HalfCheetah-v2 environment and simulate the resource-
constrained setting by removing a fixed set of randomly selected features during deployment (see
Sections 5.1.1, C.1 for more details). We train an offline RL algorithm, TD3+BC (Fujimoto & Gu,
2021) using only the online features and collect online data in the environment using the trained
policy. We repeat this assuming all features available during deployment, train a TD3+BC agent
using the same offline dataset with all features, and collect online data in the environment. We plot
the histogram of rewards in the two datasets in Fig 1b. We observe that the agent trained only with
online features obtains much smaller reward than the agent trained with offline features."

under the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) setting by assuming a belief
over the observations ( ˚Astr¨om, 1965). In contrast, we have an offline dataset (which records rich
but not necessarily full state transitions) along with partially obscured (with respect to the offline
dataset) observations online. Our goal is to leverage the offline dataset to reduce the performance
gap caused by the introduction of resource constraints. Towards this, we advocate using a teacher-
student transfer algorithm. Our main contributions are summarized below:"

RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED ONLINE SYSTEMS"
RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED ONLINE SYSTEMS,0.05194805194805195,"In the standard RL framework, we consider a Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by the tuple
(S, A, R, P, γ) where S is the state space, A is the action space, R : S × A →R is the reward
function, P : S × A →∆(S) is the transition function, ∆(S) denotes the set of all probability
distributions over S, and γ ∈(0, 1) is the discount factor. We consider the discounted infinite
horizon MDP in this paper. We consider the continuous control setting and assume that both S and
A are compact subsets of a real-valued vector space. The transition at time t, is given by the tuple
(st, at, R(st, at), st+1). Each policy π : S →∆(A), has a value function Qπ : S × A →R that
estimates the expected discounted reward for taking action a in state s and uses the policy π after
that. The goal of the agent is to learn the policy π that maximizes the expected discounted reward
Eπ[P∞
t=0 γtR(st, at)]. In online RL, this problem is solved by interacting with the environment."
RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED ONLINE SYSTEMS,0.05411255411255411,"In offline (or batch) RL (Lange et al., 2012), instead of having access to the environment, the agent
is provided with a finite dataset of trajectories or transitions denoted by D = {(si, ai, ri, s′
i)}N
i=1.
The data is collected by one or many behavior policies that induce a distribution µ on the space of
S × A. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy using the finite dataset to maximize the expected
discounted reward when deployed in the environment."
RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED ONLINE SYSTEMS,0.05627705627705628,"In the resource-constrained setting, the agent does not have access to the full state space or features
during deployment. Instead, the agent can only observe from bS (another bounded subset of the real-
valued vector space) that is different from S. It is assumed that the space S is rich in information
as compared to bS. For example, bS might have fewer dimensions, or some entries may include extra
noise (see Figure 1a). We will use online/limited features, to refer to observations from the online
space bS, offline/rich features to refer to observations from the offline space S. We assume that both
online features and offline features are available in offline data."

bS while making a decision. A similar paradigm of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI)
(Vapnik et al., 2015) has been studied under the supervised learning setting, where the privileged
information is provided by a knowledgeable teacher."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.06277056277056277,"Offline RL There has been an increasing interest in studying offline RL algorithms due to its practi-
cal advantages over online RL algorithms (Agarwal et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021;
Brandfonbrener et al., 2021). Offline RL algorithms typically suffer from overestimation of the
value function as well as distribution shift between the offline data and on-policy data. Buckman
et al. (2020) and Kumar et al. (2020) advocate a pessimistic approach to value function estimation
to avoid over-estimation of rarely observed state-action pairs. To constrain the on-policy data to be
closer to offline data, several techniques have been explored, such as restricting the actions inside the
expectation in the evaluation step to be close to the actions observed in the dataset (Fujimoto et al.,
2019), adding a regularization term during policy evaluation or iteration (Kostrikov et al., 2021),
(Wu et al., 2019),(Guo et al., 2020), adding a constraint of the form MMD(µ(·|s), π(s)) (Gretton
et al., 2012; Blanchard et al., 2021; Deshmukh et al., 2019) on the policy (Kumar et al., 2019), using
behavior cloning (Fujimoto & Gu, 2021), adding an entropy term in the value function estimation
(Wu et al., 2019), and model-based approaches that learn a pessimistic MDP Kidambi et al. (2020).
A thorough review of these techniques is presented in an excellent tutorial by Levine et al. (2020). To
the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work that addresses the resource-constrained offline
RL setting where there is a mismatch between the offline features and online features."
RELATED WORK,0.06493506493506493,"Knowledge Transfer Knowledge transfer/distillation is widely studied in various settings including
vision, language, and RL domains (Gou et al., 2021; Wang & Yoon, 2021). In RL, under the domain
transfer setting (Taylor & Stone, 2009; Liu et al., 2016), the teacher is trained on one domain/task
and the student needs to perform on a different domain/task (Konidaris & Barto, 2006; Perkins et al.,
1999; Torrey et al., 2005; Gupta et al., 2017). Li et al. (2019) train a model so that features from
different domains have similar embeddings, and Kamienny et al. (2020) perturb the feature using a
random noise centered at the privileged information. An offline RL algorithm for domain transfer"

ability to learn from an ensemble of trained policies to improve performance (Zhu et al., 2020)."
RELATED WORK,0.07142857142857142,"One distinguishing feature of the resource-constrained setting that differentiates it from other trans-
fer settings is that the teacher has access to the privileged information and student needs to adapt
from the data available without interactive learning. In most of the existing approaches, the differ-
ence between teacher and student was either the network size (which is also present in our setting
due to the difference in input features) or the dynamics (as in the domain transfer case). To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to study policy distillation in the offline RL framework under
the resource-constrained setting. Another interesting line of work is called Sim2Real (Lee et al.,
2021; Traor´e et al., 2019). In these papers, they train a model using a simulator and then transfer the
knowledge to real data. However, this work requires an accurate simulator which results in a fairly
expert teacher model. However, in the offline RL setting, depending on the data quality, the teacher
itself might be weak."

RL algorithm for image data under the POMDP setup. Our setting resembles this setup, but our agent
also has access to the full privileged features in the offline dataset while training. This availability
of the offline dataset with privileged information differentiates our setting and enables the student to
inherit the knowledge from the rich space while only using the limited features during deployment."

is a discrete control problem that is challenging especially due to the high dimensional visual input
and delayed credit assignment. Since we are in the offline RL setting, we use the DQN replay

for discrete control problems. In particular, we use the data for the following games: Pong, Qbert,
Breakout.

TRAINING AND EVALUATION,0.23376623376623376,"The DQN replay dataset consists of 50M state transitions that are collected during the training of a
DQN agent in the online setting. Each transition consists of a tuple (state, action, reward, next state)
where the state and next state are 84x84 images and the action space is discrete. Following earlier
works, we consider environments with sticky actions (the agent takes current action with probability
0.25, or otherwise repeats past actions). Additionally, we use stacking of 4 consecutive frames
together as the state space which is a common technique used for the Atari suite. Instead of using
the full 50M transitions, we use 1M transitions in the dataset that are collected during the end of the
DQN online training and hence contain expert level trajectories."
TRAINING AND EVALUATION,0.23593073593073594,"To simulate the online and offline features, we consider the following setup. We assume the actual
image observation (4x84x84) as the offline features, and a pixelated version of the images as online
features. To simulate this, we resize each (84x84) image to 16x16 and then resize it back to 84x84.

sider the setup where the agent to be deployed online uses a different network architecture than the
teacher network architecture (N-DQN). This enables the agent to utilize lesser memory and power
during deployment. We refer to this setting as the power constrained setting. We call this network
architecture as (S-DQN) by changing the size of features in the final layer. Specifically, we vary the
feature dimension with values 256, 128, 64 (see Appendix B) for more details."
TRAINING AND EVALUATION,0.24891774891774893,"We observe from both the settings that there is a significant drop in performance of the Baseline and
Transfer agents using the online features as compared to the Teacher. The Transfer agent performs
marginally better than the Baseline agent on all the three games for the N-DQN setting. For the
S-DQN setting, the Transfer agent outperforms the Baseline for Pong on all the three encoder sizes
considered. For Qbert, the Transfer agent outperforms the Baseline for one of the encoder sizes. It
is important to highlight that there is a significant gap between the performance of the Teacher and
the Transfer/Baseline agents for both the settings. This suggests that more tailored transfer learning
approaches are required for the Resource Constrained Offline RL problem."

AUTOBIDDING - ADS DATA"
AUTOBIDDING - ADS DATA,0.26406926406926406,"Purely simulated settings may not be representative for evaluating an algorithm which is meant for
real-world application. Thus, we studied agent performance in the auto-bidding task for online ad-
vertising (Bottou et al., 2013). Online advertising is a dynamic, stochastic environment. Advertisers
have increasingly delegated decisions to machines in order to achieve increased return on invest-
ment. Auto-bidding is one of the critical components in this shift towards AI-driven optimization.
Auto-bidding agents determine a unique bid for each opportunity in real-time. This problem is one
of distributed, stochastic control in a partially observable, stochastic, non-stationary environment.
This type of environment is extremely difficult to develop complex algorithms for, and it demon-
strates our setting well in that there are a myriad of computational constraints that limit the type of
models that can be considered during online operation."
AUTOBIDDING - ADS DATA,0.2662337662337662,"In this task, agents attempt to maximize the number of ad clicks they collect during a day by bidding
on queries (on which ads are shown). The set of queries which receive a bid are set by the advertiser’s
choice of bidded keywords. Agents are given a fixed daily budget to do this. They are charged
according to some black-box auction mechanism only if their ad is clicked. Agents must balance
between saving budget for future opportunities, and buying guaranteed ad space now. At each time
step, an auto-bidding agent has some information available like time of the query, details of the
ad text or bidded keyword, available budget, past spend, model-based estimate of how likely the
consumer is to click an ad, etc. This information is used as a state. Based on the state, the agent
takes an action (decides the bid) and gets feedback (if the ad was selected and/or clicked, and how
much the click costs). If the ad was clicked, the ”available budget” feature in the state is updated."

AUTOBIDDING - ADS DATA,0.2727272727272727,"The budget constraint in this problem means that it cannot be modeled using contextual bandits (as
many Ads problems can), because the next state depends on the action taken. If the agent bids $10
given an available budget of $100, it can expect to have at least $90 to spend for the rest of the day.
This $90 is part of the state for the next step. If the agent bids $1 in the same situation, it may expect
to have at least $99 for the rest of the day. This rest-of-day budget constraint is a key part of the
state, as it restricts the trajectory of future states and actions thus, requiring an MDP formulation."
AUTOBIDDING - ADS DATA,0.2748917748917749,"We have pulled query-level Ads data for 10 days and 8,000 advertisers (from a proprietary dataset).
The features that are available online and offline include (but not limited to) the time of the query,
a model-based estimate of how likely the consumer is to click an ad, remaining budget, and past
spend. The features that are only available offline are model-based embeddings of the query and
the bidded keywords as they require extensive computational resources. There are 881 features
available offline and 111 features available online. The main constraint limiting the types of models
and features used in the online setting is computation time, as the user who generated the query will
not accept a wait time of more than a fraction of a second before they want to see their search results.
We trained on 80% of the advertisers using the proposed TD3+BC transfer algorithm and evaluated
on the remaining 20% using the FQE (Le et al., 2019) algorithm."
AUTOBIDDING - ADS DATA,0.27705627705627706,"In Figure 4, FQE estimates are normalized by the value estimate at the beginning of the first epoch
(before policies are trained), which is the same value for all settings (since before training all policies
are initialized as random with a fixed seed). We report the average normalized metrics across 10
seeds. Normalization is done to mask the identities of advertisers, which are business-sensitive.
Transfer (0.0, 1.0) tends to perform better than other models including the baseline (Transfer (1.0,
0.0),i.e. without transfer). Furthermore, out of 10 different seeds, Transfer (0.0, 1.0) outperforms
Transfer (1.0, 0.0) 7 times suggesting the applicability of incorporating transfer learning."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.2813852813852814,"In this work, we address an open challenge in Offline RL. In the resource-constrained setting that is
motivated by real world applications, the features available during training offline may be different
than the limited features available online during deployment. We highlighted a performance gap be-
tween offline RL agents trained using only the online features and agents trained using all the offline
features. To bridge this gap, we proposed a student-teacher-based policy transfer learning approach.
The proposed algorithm improves over the baseline significantly even when the dataset quality is
lacking in the resource-constrained setting. The simplicity of the approach (with just one additional
hyperparameter) makes it easy to extend it to other offline RL algorithms. It would be interesting to
study other transfer learning approaches (e.g., policy transfer with other divergence regularizations
for stochastic policies) in the future. Moreover, we observe that the proposed approach benefits es-
pecially when the dataset quality is low which is often the case with real world datasets. Despite this,
the performance gap with the teacher is still high (in the low quality data regime) and this suggests
more tailored approaches are required."

algorithm which shows that by adding an additional behavior cloning term to an existing online RL
algorithm TD3 (Fujimoto et al., 2018) (that learns a deterministic policy), it is possible to attain state-
of-the-art performance on the D4RL benchmark datasets (Fu et al., 2020). The policy evaluation
step in TD3+BC is the same as TD3 where the minimum of two Q functions is used to reduce the
over-estimation bias of the value function. In the policy iteration step, the behavior cloning term

DATASET COLLECTION PROCEDURE: RC-D4RL"
REFERENCES,0.49783549783549785,"For the dataset collection using policies trained with limited features, we follow a similar protocol as
the D4RL data collection procedure (Fu et al., 2020). In the D4RL benchmark suite, offline datasets
with different difficulty levels are collected based on the exploration capacity of the data-collecting
policy or behavior policy. The difficulty levels are denoted as medium-replay, medium, medium-
expert and expert. For each combination (environment, difficulty, dimension, seed) in Table 1, we
train an expert policy by training a TD3 (Fujimoto et al., 2018) algorithm for 1 million timesteps
using the limited features, and using the base hyperparameters of the TD3 algorithm. We then train
the medium policy by training the TD3 algorithm until the agent reaches roughly half of the reward
achieved by the expert policy for this combination. These policies are deployed in the simulator and
the interactions are logged to generate the expert and medium datasets. Note that all the features are
logged in the datasets. The medium-replay data comprises of the environment interactions recorded"

medium and expert policies. Thus, we generate in total 240 3 offline RL datasets. Note that we did
not perform hyperparameter tuning to compute the expert data collection policy and only used the
base hyperparameters used in the TD3 paper4. We can observe the variation in the quality of the
datasets with the dimensionality of online features and the difficulty from Table C.6 which reinforces
the need to evaluate the proposed algorithm with the RC-D4RL datasets."

perform 10 different rollouts using this simulator with random initial states and compute the mean of
the cumulative rewards. We perform one round of evaluation of the policy (student or baseline) dur-
ing training at a fixed frequency. We take the average value of the last 10 evaluation rounds during
training and report the mean and the standard deviation of the score. Lastly, since we run multiple
trials (for each configuration), we compute the mean and standard deviation of the results of the three
random trials for the given configuration. In order to facilitate easier understanding and comparison

See Figures 7a and 8a."

line), and what part of that performance is recovered by using the transfer algorithm (Table 5)."
REFERENCES,0.5216450216450217,"Dataset Difficulty: From Figures 7a and 8a, we observe that majority of the performance gains
have been observed for the medium or medium-replay datasets. The expert and medium-expert
datasets consistently provided relatively lesser % improvement, and in some cases performed worse
than the baseline. The trend is consistent across the different environments (although it is more
significant for HalfCheetah-v2). With expert or medium-expert datasets, the coverage of the state-
action product space is narrow but of good quality. When training with limited features, the trained
policy can drift away from this distribution. Since the data distribution is narrow, it is difficult for
the trained policy to distinguish between unsafe state-action pairs from the safe state-action pairs.
Whereas for the datasets with poor quality (medium, medium-replay), the data distribution is wide.
The regularization from the teacher is stronger and also the agent can better discriminate unsafe
state-action pairs due to the good coverage of the data."
REFERENCES,0.5238095238095238,"Reduced Feature Dimension: From Fig 8b, we observe that the performance gains with the pro-
posed algorithm follows an inverted ”U” pattern where the performance gain is highest when the
reduced dimension is neither too less nor too large. When the reduced dimension is small, the online
and offline features might be less correlated and hence the transfer is not efficient. When the online
feature dimension is already high, the baseline has a decent performance and therefore the % per-
formance improvement over the baseline is limited. This trend is more pronounced for the results
on D4RL datasets but not very clear on the RC-D4RL datasets."

only online features (in the baseline) by measuring the percentage difference as compared to the
teacher model (trained using full offline features). As we can observe, the baseline consistently
under performs the teacher (as far as -70% in some cases). We also show the percentage drop in
performance of the proposed transfer method trained using the teacher and that the transfer approach
can recover some lost performance by not using the offline features. Interestingly, we observe that
for higher quality datasets, the improvement offered by the transfer approach is limited. Moreoever,
we observe that increasing the weight of the teacher has a positive impact on the performance (as
can also be seen for the Ads results and Atari results)."

features and the actual offline features. The trained autoencoder is than passed to the offline RL
algorithm (that is trained for deployment). During every step of training, the algorithm takes the
online features, predicts the offline features using the autoencoder and uses the predicted features as
the state observation. Similarly, during evaluation, the trained agent first predicts the features using
online features and uses them to take an action."

of low quality). Similar conclusions hold true for the predictive baseline (autoencoder). Although
the performance on the expert datasets is quite good for these baselines, real world datasets are often
a mixture of datasets from multiple policies and are often noisy. Although these algorithms provide
a strong starting point, they may not be quite useful in real applications."
