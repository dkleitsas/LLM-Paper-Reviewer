ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.005076142131979695,"Iterated batch reinforcement learning (RL) is a growing subﬁeld fueled by the de-
mand from systems engineers for intelligent control solutions that they can apply
within their technical and organizational constraints. Model-based RL (MBRL)
suits this scenario well for its sample efﬁciency and modularity. Recent MBRL
techniques combine efﬁcient neural system models with classical planning (like
model predictive control; MPC). In this paper we add two components to this
classical setup. The ﬁrst is a Dyna-style policy learned on the system model using
model-free techniques. We call it the guide since it guides the planner. The second
component is the explorer, a strategy to expand the limited knowledge of the guide
during planning. Through a rigorous ablation study we show that exploration is
crucial for optimal performance. We apply this approach with a DQN guide and
a heating explorer to improve the state of the art of the resource-limited Acrobot
benchmark system by about 10%."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.015228426395939087,"John is a telecommunication engineer. His day job is to operate a mobile antenna. He has about
forty knobs to turn, in principle every ﬁve minutes, based on about a hundred external and internal
system observables. His goal is to keep some performance indicators within operational limits while
optimizing some others. In the evenings John dreams about using reinforcement learning (RL) to
help him with his job. He knows that he cannot put an untrusted model-free agent on the antenna
control (failures are very costly), but he manages to convince his boss to run live tests a couple of
days every month."
INTRODUCTION,0.02030456852791878,"John’s case is arguably on the R&D table of a lot of engineering companies today. AI adoption
is slow, partly because these companies have little experience with AI, but partly also because the
algorithms we develop fail to address the constraints and operational requirements of these systems.
What are the common attributes of these systems?"
INTRODUCTION,0.025380710659898477,"• They are physical, not getting faster with time, producing tiny data compared to what
model-free RL (MFRL) algorithms require for training.
• System access is limited to a small number of relatively short live tests, each producing
logs that can be used to evaluate the current policy and can be fed into the training of the
next.
• They are relatively small-dimensional, and system observables were designed to support
human control decisions, so there is no need to ﬁlter them or to learn representations (with
the exception when the engineer uses complex images, e.g., a driver).
• Rewards are non-sparse, performance indicators come continually. Delays are possible but
usually not long.
• Safe operation even during live tests is crucial. Simulators and digital twins are more and
more available, but some systems are too complex to simulate from ﬁrst principles."

(2012) call it growing batch). Furthermore, we are interested in model-based RL (Deisenroth &
Rasmussen, 2011; Chua et al., 2018; Moerland et al., 2021) because i) it is sample efﬁcient (Chua

the adoption of data-driven algorithms by systems engineers."
INTRODUCTION,0.04568527918781726,"Given a robust system model, simple model predictive control (MPC) agents using random shooting
(RS; Richards (2005); Rao (2010)) or the cross entropy method (CEM; de Boer et al. (2004)) have
been shown to perform remarkably well on many benchmark systems (Nagabandi et al., 2018; Chua
et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Hafner et al., 2019; K´egl et al., 2021) and real-life domains such as
robotics (Yang et al., 2020). On the other hand, implementing successfully the seemingly elegant
Dyna-style approach (Sutton, 1991; Kurutach et al., 2018; Clavera et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2019),
when we learn model-free agents on the system model and apply them on the real system, remains
challenging especially on systems that require planning with long horizon. Our main ﬁnding is that
the Dyna-style approach can be an excellent choice for iterated batch RL by adding to it a decision-
time planning guided by the model-free policy and a dynamically self-tuning exploration. The key
is that exploration and bootstrapping with a value function estimate affords us shorter rollouts so
we can reduce the accumulation of errors that plagues the Dyna-style approach with long horizons
(Janner et al., 2019). We also innovate on the experimental framework (metrics, statistically rigorous
measurements), so we can proﬁt from the modularity of the Dyna-style approach, tuning ingredients
(model, the MFRL guide policy, exploration, planning, bootstrapping) independently. This modular
approach makes engineering easier (as opposed to monolithic approaches like AlphaZero (Silver
et al., 2017)), which is an important aspect if we want to give the methodology to non-expert systems
engineers."
INTRODUCTION,0.050761421319796954,"We demonstrate our GUIDE&EXPLORE approach on the small-dimensional but difﬁcult Acrobot
system which is known to be especially tough for Dyna-style techniques (Wang et al., 2019). We
show in a rigorous ablation study how each ingredient adds a small but signiﬁcant improvement,
achieving a 10% total margin over the current state of the art (Wang et al., 2019; Wang & Ba,
2020; K´egl et al., 2021). DYNAZERO (pure Dyna-style with an AlphaZero guide) also matches the
asymptotic performance with a larger sample complexity (3x) and computational (5x) price tag."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.1065989847715736,"The MBRL subﬁeld has seen a proliferation of powerful methods, but most of them miss the spe-
ciﬁc requirements (solving problems irrelevant in this scenario like representation learning or sparse
rewards) and missing others (limited and costly system access; data taking and experimentation
through campaigns, live tests; safety) (Hamrick, 2019)."
RELATED WORK,0.1116751269035533,"The Dyna framework developed by Sutton (1991) consists in training an agent from both real ex-
perience and from simulations from a system model learned from the real data. Its efﬁcient use of
system access makes it a natural candidate for iterated batch RL. The well-known limitation of this
approach is the agent overﬁtting the imperfect system model (Grill et al., 2020). A ﬁrst solution
is to use short rollouts on the model to reduce error accumulation as done in Model-Based Policy
Optimization (MBPO; Janner et al. (2019)). Another solution is to rely on ensembling techniques
for the model. Kurutach et al. (2018)’s ME-TRPO is based on an ensemble of models and Trust
Region Policy Optimization (TRPO; Schulman et al. (2015)). At each TRPO step a transition is
sampled from a randomly picked model of the ensemble, preventing the policy from overﬁtting one
model. An ensemble is also used in Model-Based Meta-Policy Optimization (MP-MPO; Clavera
et al. (2018)) where each model of the ensemble is seen as a different task used to meta-learn a pol-
icy. The meta-policy is then able to quickly adapt to any of the dynamics model and is more robust
to model inaccuracies. Instead of learning the model and then the policy from the model, Stochastic
Lower Bound Optimization (SLBO; Luo et al. (2019)) alternates between model and policy updates.
In our ITERATEDMBRL skeleton (Fig 1), this strategy would couple the LEARN and MFRL steps,
which we do not study in this paper. We note that according to the results shown in Fig 1.(a) and
Table 1 in Wang et al. (2019), ME-TRPO, SLBO and MB-MPO alone (pure Dyna, without plan-
ning) are clearly suboptimal on the Acrobot system1, similar to the performance obtained by our
pure Dyna DQN (Section 4). Finally, Yu et al. (2020) and Kidambi et al. (2020) use a Dyna-style
approach in the context of pure batch RL where no further data collection and therefore no further
model updates are assumed."
RELATED WORK,0.116751269035533,"The idea of using a guide and a value function when planning is not novel (Silver et al., 2017; Schrit-
twieser et al., 2020; Wang & Ba, 2020; Argenson & Dulac-Arnold, 2020). We were greatly inspired
by these elements in our objective of building smarter agents as they can make the search more
efﬁcient and thus lead to a better performance. POPLIN-A (Wang & Ba, 2020) relies on behavior
cloning (using only real experience, unlike our Dyna-style approach that mainly uses the model),
but their guide is similar to our approach. During the planning, they add random noise to the actions
recommended by a deterministic policy network and update the noise distribution using a CEM
strategy. In a similar way our GUIDE&EXPLORE strategy also adds a carefully controled amount
of noise to the recommended actions. Our results highlight the importance of a well-calibrated ex-
ploration, which also contributes to the understanding of POPLIN-A. Argenson & Dulac-Arnold
(2020) and Lowrey et al. (2019) both found that bootstrapping with a value estimate improves the
performance of simple guided MPC strategies. The popular AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017) and
MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020) algorithms also rely on a guide and a value function for their
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We implement a Dyna-style version of AlphaZero, which we call
DYNAZERO. The principal issue of MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020) in our micro-data iterated
batch RL context is that it does not control the number of system access steps: it needs to simulate a
lot from the real environment to establish the targets for the value function. In these two algorithms
the guide is updated from the results obtained during the search that it guided, a procedure known
as Dual Policy Iteration (Sun et al., 2018). We prefer experiencing with Dyna-style approaches ﬁrst
to leverage popular MFRL algorithms and defer the study of Dual Policy Iteration to future work."
RELATED WORK,0.1218274111675127,"Our results show that planning is an important ingredient, a claim already made by Hamrick et al.
(2021). They use MuZero to run their ablation study while we prefer using an explicit model for
practical reasons explained in the introduction. Besides planning we also study the importance of
exploration."

A NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY,0.16243654822335024,"By model we will consistently refer to the learned transition or system model p (never to any policy).
Rollout is the procedure of obtaining a trace T from an initial state s1 by alternating a model or
real system p and a policy π (Fig 1). We decided to rename what Silver et al. (2017) calls the
prior policy to guide since prior clashes with Bayesian terminology (as, e.g., Grill et al. (2020);
Hamrick et al. (2021) also note), and guide expresses well that the role of this policy is to guide
the search/planning. Sometimes the guide is also called the reactive policy (Sun et al., 2018) since
it is typically an explicit function or conditional distribution ξ : s ; a that can be executed or
drawn from rapidly. We will call the (often implicit) policy π : s ; a resulting from the guided
plan/search the actor (sometimes also called the non-reactive policy since it takes time to simulate
from the model, before each action). We will learn the guide ξ using MFRL mainly on the model
p, but, when possible, off-policy (since π ̸= ξ) data (system trace T ) obtained by acting on the real
system will also be used. In that sense, through the data from the real system, planning is part of
training the guide. However, since from the point of view of the MFRL guide, the model p is the
world, we will not use the term planning to refer to the rollouts of the model p and the guide ξ when
training the guide on p, rather we will reserve planning to the guided search procedure that results
in acting on the real system."

MODEL-BASED ACTOR POLICIES: GUIDE AND EXPLORE"
A NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY,0.27411167512690354,"Our main contribution is a Dyna-style GUIDE&EXPLORE strategy (Fig 2). The gist is to learn a
guide policy ξ using a model-free RL technique on the model p and on the traces collected on the
real system T . It is known that the guide ξ, executed as an actor π = ξ on the real system, does
not work (we also conﬁrm it in Section 4), partly because ξ overﬁts the model (Fig 5 in Kurutach
et al. (2018); Grill et al. (2020)), partly because the goal of π is not only to exploit the traces
T = ∪N
τ=1T (τ) collected so far and model p = LEARN(T ), but also to collect data to self-improve
p and ξ/π in the next episode τ. This second reason is particular in our iterated batch setup: in
pure batch RL, exploration is not an issue. We explore implicitly because of the randomness of
planning (HETEROGENEOUSRS in Fig 3), but it turns out that it needs to be augmented by explicit
exploration strategies. To show this, we experiment with two strategies, i) HEATING: modulating"

the search and to let the planner to dynamically choose the right amount of randomization when

usually augmented to six by taking sine and cosine of the angles (Brockman et al., 2016); θ1 is the
angle to the vertical axis of the upper link; θ2 is the angle of the lower link relative to the upper link,
both being clipped to [−π, π]; ˙θ1 and ˙θ2 are the corresponding angular momenta. For the starting
position s1 of each episode, all four state variables are sampled uniformly from an approximately

continuous-reward engineering systems. Similarly to K´egl et al. (2021), we set the number of
episodes to N = 100, the number of steps per episode to T = 200, the number of planning
rollouts to n = 100, and the horizon to L = 10. With these settings, we can identify four dis-
tinctively different regimes (see the attached videos): i) the random uniform policy π(0) achieves
MAR ≈0.1 −0.2 (Acrobot keeps approximately hanging), ii) reasonable models with random
shooting or pure Dyna-style controllers achieve MAR ≈1.4−1.6 (Acrobot gains energy but moves
its limb quite uncontrollably), iii) random shooting n = 100, L = 10 with good models such as
PETS (Chua et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019) or DARMDN (K´egl et al., 2021) keep the limb up and
manage to have its tip above horizon on average MAR ≈2.0−2.1 (previous state of the art), and iv)
in our experiments we could achieve a quasi perfect policy (Acrobot moves up like a gymnast and
stays balanced at the top) MAR ≈2.7 −2.8 using random shooting with n = 100 K, L = 20 on the
real system, giving us a target and a possibly large margin of improvement. Acrobot is also an ideal
benchmark for making our point since it turned out quite challenging for Dyna-style techniques in
Wang et al. (2019)’s benchmarks (MAR ≈1.6 −1.7)."

real observations are performed on the model to sample transitions which are then placed in an
experience replay buffer, along with the real transitions observed during the rollouts (Fig 1/Line 7).
The DQN is then updated by sampling batches from this buffer. For DQN alone (without planning),
an ε-greedy strategy is used for its training (ε decaying as more training samples are used) and at

guide a planning of n rollouts with horizon L. It is important to note here that planning without ex-
ploration using the greedy guide is, in our case, equivalent to no planning since both the model p and

No parameters means that a different ε or temperature is used for each of the n rollouts. By default
the value estimate is the TOTALREWARD (Fig 3). We add BOOTSTRAP when we use bootstrapping

EPSGREEDYEXPLORE(ε = 0.05)) signiﬁcantly improves the performance but remains worse than
random shooting RSACTOR(n = 100, L = 10). To propel the Dyna-style actor above simple MPC,
we need to ﬁne tune exploration. We found that allowing the planner to choose the right amount is a
robust and safe approach. The ﬁnal improvement was attained by adding value bootstrapping to the
heated explorer/planner; bootstrapping does not improve the ε-greedy actor, possibly because the
value estimate of the guide ξ is off on random actions, unlike in the heating exploration when the
explorer “softly” increases the probability of actions, given by the guide. As a reference, we also
include a simple but costly RSACTOR(n = 100 K, L = 10). It would not be ofﬁcially accepted in

robot system where previously Dyna-style algorithms were failing. Our empirical results exhibit the
importance of using a planning guided by a policy with the correct amount of exploration. We thus
propose a strategy to automatically ﬁne-tune exploration and add bootstrapping with a value func-
tion estimate to further improves the performance. This combination leads to an improvement over
the previous state of the art by 10% while respecting the same resource constraints. Future work
includes modelling the uncertainties of the value estimates so as to use them for better exploration."

from a randomly sampled real observation and performs 50 steps before being reset to a new real

REFERENCES,0.9137055837563451,"We show in this section that a guided planning and exploration are needed to obtain the best result.
Remove either planning or exploration and you will obtain suboptimal performance. To support
this claim we ran an ablation study with EPSGREEDYEXPLORE. EPSGREEDYEXPLORE makes it
easy to control the degree of exploration through the ε parameter. Setting ε to 0 corresponds to no
exploration and is equivalent to using the guide greedily without planning (n = 1 and L = 1) as our
model is used deterministically when sampled from. Setting ε to 1 corresponds to full exploration
and is equivalent to the purely random RSACTOR(n = 100, L = 10). Figure 6 shows the results
obtained by DQN(ε = 0.05), DQN with a forced ε-greedy scheme at decision time with ε = 0.4
and no planning (DQN(ε = 0.4)), and DQN with planning and ﬁxed ε values (DQN(n = 100,
L = 10)-EPSGREEDYEXPLORE(ε) for ε ∈{0.0001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 0.99, 0.9999}).

which uses no planning but forces the exploration with ε = 0.4 and the performance of DQN(n =
100, L = 10)-EPSGREEDYEXPLORE(ε = 0.4) which uses planning and the same ﬁxed value of ε.
Second, as expected, the closer ε is to 0 the closer the performance is to DQN(ε = 0.05), and the
closer ε is to 1 the closer the performance is to RSACTOR(n = 100, L = 10). With a well-chosen
ε between these two extremes, say ε = 0.4, we obtain a better performance than either extremes."

MODELS"
REFERENCES,0.934010152284264,"In Table 4 we compare the performances of models from K´egl et al. (2021) when applied with
our best agent DQN(n = 100, L = 10)-HEATINGEXPLORE-BOOTSTRAP. Most models be-
long to the family of Deep (Autoregressive) Mixture Density Networks with D components,
D{AR}MDN(D){det}, trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood. The ‘det’ sufﬁx means
that the model is sampled from deterministically, returning the mean of the predicted distribution.
DARNNs are Deep Autoregressive Neural Networks point-estimating a mean by minimizing the
mean squared error and estimating a constant variance using the residual errors. These models are
homoscedastic with a variance independent of the input. The reader can also refer to K´egl et al.
(2021) for a complete description of these models. In the paper we use the second best model
DARMDN(1)det over the non-autoregressive DMDN(1)det because we ﬁnd autoregressive models
to be easier to use in practice on real-life projects due to their ability to model dependence between
the observable dimensions and to model different feature types. We also note that, as observed in
K´egl et al. (2021) with RSACTOR(n = 100, L = 10), the deterministic versions perform slightly
better than the stochastic ones, in general."

simulations that for the Acrobot to stay balanced, it was necessary (although not always sufﬁcient) to
have a reward larger than 2.6. We see from Fig 7 that this can be achieved with a simple agent such
as RSACTOR but at the price of a very large number of generated rollouts. The goal is therefore to
