ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.0037593984962406013,"Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) aims to develop a machine that can automatically
evaluate facial attractiveness. Usually, these results were highly correlated with
human ratings, and therefore also reﬂected human bias in annotations. Everyone
will have biases that are usually subconscious and not easy to notice. Unconscious
bias deserves more attention than explicit discrimination. It affects moral judgement
and can evade moral responsibility, and we cannot eliminate it completely. A new
challenge for scientists is to provide training data and AI algorithms that can
withstand distorted information. Our experiments prove that human aesthetic
judgements are usually biased. In this work, we introduce AestheticNet, the most
advanced attractiveness prediction network, with a Pearson correlation coefﬁcient
of 0.9601, which is signiﬁcantly better than the competition. This network is then
used to enrich the training data with synthetic images in order to overwrite the
ground truth values with fair assessments.
We propose a new method to generate an unbiased CNN to improve the fairness
of machine learning. Prediction and recommender systems based on Artiﬁcial
Intelligence (AI) technology are widely used in various sectors of industry, such
as intelligent recruitment, security, etc. Therefore, their fairness is very important.
Our research provides a practical example of how to build a fair and trustable AI."

MOTIVATION"
MOTIVATION,0.011278195488721804,"In 2016 Beauty.AI, a Hong-Kong based technology company, hosted the ﬁrst international beauty
contest judged by artiﬁcial intelligence (beauty.ai, 2016) but the results were heavily biased, for
example, against dark skin (Levin, 2016) subjects. “Machine learning models are prone to biased
decisions, due to biases in data-sets” (Sharma et al., 2020). Biased training data potentially leads
to discriminatory models, as the datasets are created by humans or derived from human activities
in the past, for example hiring algorithms (Bogen, 2019). The reason for racist and discriminatory
tendencies must be identiﬁed. As the learning algorithms become more complex, understanding why
the decisions are made, or even how, prove to be nearly impossible (Bostrom & Yudkowsky, 2018).
Therefore, the development of non-biased and fair training data and AI algorithms (deﬁned by the
European Commission High-Level Expert Group on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (European Commission
High-Level Expert Group on Artiﬁcial Intelligence [AI HLEG], 2019)) is a new and increasingly
complex challenge for scientists around the world (Bellamy et al., 2018). The speciﬁc ﬁeld of
aesthetic judgement is especially vulnerable to being biased, as aesthetic judgement itself is already a
subjective rating (Richmond, 2017)."
MOTIVATION,0.015037593984962405,"The purpose of facial beauty prediction (FBP) research is to classify images mimicking subjective
human judgements. Investigations related to machine perception in a ground-truth free setting
show that the data source depends on the measurement of human perception (Prijatelj et al., 2020).
Therefore, artiﬁcial networks need a process to determine labels of the average person’s judgement.
Our data analysis has already proven that people consider their own ethnicity to be more attractive
than others (Gerlach et al., 2020), this is the major bias in our experiments and within our dataset.
With this tendency, it becomes difﬁcult to generate input data to train a machine-learning algorithm,
which assesses a person’s attractiveness without bias."
MOTIVATION,0.018796992481203006,"This work not only helps to achieve moral enhancement through AI (see appendix B.1), but also
helps eliminating social problems with this new technology (see appendix B.2)."

STATE OF THE ART"
STATE OF THE ART,0.03007518796992481,"While research on the estimation of images or portraits is not a new trend, it has gained increasing
attention since the emergence of artiﬁcial intelligence (Zhang & Kreiman, 2021). Although, for many
applications like autonomous driving, or image classiﬁcation, AI undoubtedly is the best solution,
applications that are affected by unconscious bias, like beauty prediction (Dornaika et al., 2020), tend
to reﬂect bias that is likely to be prevalent within given datasets. Especially, when people subjective
preferences play a role, such as in attractiveness judgement (Shank & DeSanti, 2018) or human
resource evaluation (Lloyd, 2018), bias is almost certain to happen. Carrera (2020) conducted a
piece of research on the implication of racism in image databases, that analysed the association of
aggressiveness, kindness, beauty and ugliness with different images and found that the decisions of
many people are affected by subconscious racism. Since researchers are aware of such effect, they
found different ways to reduce subconscious bias in machine learning. Since the problem originates
from the given databases, either the databases, or the training need to be changed."
STATE OF THE ART,0.03383458646616541,"The possibilities to change the databases include adding data, also referred to as fair pre-
processing (Bellamy et al., 2018), either by selection or augmentation to insert underrepresented
samples. While, deleting images is usually a bad idea, since it increases the chances of the network
overﬁtting, it could theoretically be used to eliminate overrepresented images. On the other side, train-
ing can be altered by selecting only images, that do not increase the variance of each class currently
used as training input. For example, variational autoencoders can be used to extract the features of
the image, to later determine their variance, and only select images as input that do not increase the
variance within given classes. Bellamy et al. (2018) also describe a third method, they called fair
post-processing. Since their pipeline aimed to create debiased databases, the post-processing step is
usually not applicable for most machine learning applications not creating databases."

not only related to ethnic background, but also related to age which also has been proven by other
researchers (Gerlach et al., 2020), (Akbari et al., 2020)."

least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is
correct (Aschwanden, 2015). The precise calculation of the p-value in this experiment is difﬁcult
because the factorials raise too high, to be reasonably computed on the thousands of labelled values.
We calculate the p-value on 300 representative annotations which lead to a p-value of approximately
0.063%, therefore it is safe to say the null hypothesis can be rejected and we do have an ethical bias."

stochastic approach. In our experiment we varied the ratio from 2:1 to 1:3.2 for German annotations

Therefore, the possibility exists, that all datasets are affected by bias, which the networks trained on
them transfer into the FBP. Solving this problem, training an unbiased network with biased data, is a
recently much discussed subject in the area of Machine Learning (Amini et al., 2019; Bellamy et al.,
2018)."
TRAINING NETWORK FEATURES,0.2857142857142857,"To achieve the ﬁrst results on unbiased aesthetic estimation, we used the existing VGG-Face frame-
work in Keras with TensorFlow and adjusted it. The network consists of 11 blocks, each containing a"

et al., 2015). We apply transfer learning here and use the pretrained model for Face Recognition
(Parkhi et al., 2015). Building up on the face recognition, attractiveness estimation is similar to
age estimation (Gyawali et al., 2020) performed by observing the facial features from portraits.
Comparable to age estimation, the network then assigns the Portrait a beauty score."
TRAINING NETWORK FEATURES,0.29699248120300753,"The convolutional layers in the network are followed by a rectiﬁcation layer (ReLu) as in (Krizhevsky
et al., 2017). We used the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2017). The input to our network is a face
image of the size 256 × 256 × 3, and it uses Zero-Padding around the edges, to ensure that the image
information on the edge is not lost. Our input data is split into 60% train and 40% test data. The
convolutional layers parameters of VGG-Face are not changed and kept frozen during the training.
We use a dropout of 50%, and as it is a regression problem our ﬁnal layer must be the size of 1. To
classify the aesthetic score, a softmax activation function is used in the ﬁnal layer. As a loss metric,
we use the mean squared error and to compare our networks we also calculate the Pearson correlation
and the root mean squared error."

BALANCED TRAINING"
BALANCED TRAINING,0.30451127819548873,"The process and the effect of the ratio on the average aesthetic rating is shown in ﬁg. 8. By modifying
the ratio of the annotations a minimum is determined that illustrates the lowest difference between the
average aesthetic prediction of Asian and European faces. This represents a speciﬁc loss function for
our network that maps bias onto measurable values. To remove bias from our network, we calculate
the difference between European and Asian aesthetic predictions and ﬁnd the global minimum."
BALANCED TRAINING,0.3082706766917293,"Figure 9: CNN aesthetic prediction with equalised distribution of training data. The charts on the left
side show the prediction of the network if it is only trained on Chinese or German annotations. On
the right side, the prediction of the network, which was trained on the biased data is shown. All bars
have more or less the same height and only differ minimally. This means, that we could eliminate
most of the bias in the training data, by balancing and we can assume that this trained network is fair."
BALANCED TRAINING,0.31203007518796994,"The minimum of the average aesthetic score between Asian and European faces is located at a
ratio of 1:1.9 where the average aesthetic score differs by about 5%. We create a model with a fair
performance over all classes of different ethnicities as shown in ﬁg. 9. This proves, that by resampling
and balancing the training data a less biased AI can be created. We are retaining the precision in FBP,
as shown in table 1. This process creates a less-biased AI in FBP tasks."
BALANCED TRAINING,0.3157894736842105,"Our results are displayed in ﬁg. 9 where all bar charts have a similar height and the FBP score is
considerably less biased. Not all bars have the exact same height, this is due to some background
noise. Real world data usually contains noise which affects tasks such as classiﬁcation in machine
learning (Gupta & Gupta, 2019). This noise also affects our aesthetic prediction, however with
those minor differences, we can consider our network as unbiased and therefore fair. As we use a
factor based approach to multiply the annotation data, this noise is present over all ratios. Only the
difference of the averages increases or decreases within the variations of the ratio."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.32706766917293234,"Our two main contributions are AestheticNet and a new approach to bias-free machine learning tools.
In this work, we have proposed to augment the SCUT-FBP dataset by synthesised GAN images
and show that AestheticNet predicts facial attractiveness with higher correlation then competitive
approaches. Then we utilise a novel learning strategy to minimise bias in networks. Unbiased
networks are an important step towards a future, where more decisions are made by AI and therefore
more lives are inﬂuenced by artiﬁcial intelligence - unbiased decision making is the foundation of
ethical and moral values."
CONCLUSION,0.3308270676691729,"Bias-free decision making is a challenging problem in machine learning tasks, yet it yields the great
potential to be one of the most signiﬁcant strengths of an AI. We have shown a method to eliminate
bias in facial attractiveness prediction and this method can be transferred to multiple similar networks."
CONCLUSION,0.33458646616541354,"Training an unbiased model on biased data is an important goal from a Machine Learning Perspective,
as perfect, unbalanced data might be raw. Especially in the ﬁeld of Aesthetic Judgement, it is
important that the machine is able to realise the bias. By learning, how to act against this bias, we
can scale this approach in the future on larger datasets in other areas. The algorithm is introduced
by applying it to aesthetic judgement, but not limited to it. Further development and deployment of
fair and unbiased AI systems is crucial for AI to be a social beneﬁt for all and reduce algorithmic
discrimination."
CONCLUSION,0.3383458646616541,"Implicit bias has always been a hot-spot in the ﬁeld of psychology in the 21st century. With the
intersection of disciplines, a series of moral and ethical issues arising from it have also attracted the
attention of the philosophical ﬁeld. Implicit bias is widespread and is in a silent way. It affects all
aspects of our lives, even in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence, which is equally popular in the 21st
century. In this article, we have veriﬁed the universality of implicit existence and artiﬁcial intelligence
will copy human prejudice by proving the establishment of two hypotheses. On this basis, we have
analysed the reasons for the existence of implicit bias from neuroscience and psychology. Next,
we used experimental methods to systematically demonstrate how human implicit bias affects the
decision-making of artiﬁcial intelligence and found a way to eliminate the implicit bias of artiﬁcial
intelligence. Secondly, we improved the fairness of the algorithm from machine learning. From
a perspective, the training of unbiased models on biased data is an important goal, and unbiased
networks are an important step towards the future. In the future, artiﬁcial intelligence will make more
decisions, so more lives will be affected by artiﬁcial intelligence. Unbiased artiﬁcial intelligence
decision-making is the moral foundation."
CONCLUSION,0.34210526315789475,"One problem that has to be tackled in the future is the issue that our attractiveness was elo rated and
is hence not equally distributed per level of attractiveness. Very attractive and very unattractive faces
are much less common than average faces. In order to make up for that we used stargan v2 (Choi
et al., 2020) to enhance our data set by computer generated faced that are meant to be more attractive
than real faces. The generated images were rated in another survey and in fact came out to be more
attractive than real ones. As scientiﬁc AI-researchers, we require our work to maintain sufﬁcient awe
of nature and morality. This is our current and future work. As Kant said, “Two things ﬁll the mind
with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reﬂect upon them:
the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.”"

coefﬁcient is less than 0; if the correlation coefﬁcient is equal to 0, there is no linearity correlation

CAUSES OF UNCONSCIOUS BIAS"
REFERENCES,0.8872180451127819,"1. Susceptibility to bias.
We are used to the brain’s fast, emotional, unconscious thinking mode.
Kahneman states in (Kahneman, 2011) that there are two systems in the brain to organise our daily
life: System 1 and System 2. Fast, emotional, and unconscious activities like driving, talking, or
cleaning use System 1 since it requires little or even no effort, but it is often prone to errors. System 2
is slow, logical, effortful, conscious thought, where reason dominates. System 1 is a kind of mental
shortcut, and we take this shortcut. Rules of thumb, educated guesses, and using “common sense”
are all forms of mental shortcuts. Implicit bias is a result of taking one of these cognitive shortcuts
inaccurately (Rynders, 2019). As a result, we incorrectly rely on these unconscious stereotypes
to provide guidance in a very complex world. Especially when we are under high levels of stress
we are more likely to rely on these biases than to examine all the relevant surrounding information
(Wigboldus et al., 2004)."
REFERENCES,0.8909774436090225,"2. We seek patterns.
One key reason we develop such biases is that our brains have a natural
tendency to look for patterns and associations in order to make sense of a very complicated world.
Research shows that even before kindergarten, children already use their group membership (e.g.,
racial group, gender group, age group, etc.) to guide inferences about the psychological and be-
havioural traits. At such a young age, they have already begun to seek out patterns and recognise
what distinguishes them from other groups. Not only do children recognise what sets them apart
from other groups, they believe “what is similar to me is good, and what is different from me is bad”
(Cameron et al., 2001). Children aren’t just noticing how similar or dissimilar they are to others, but
also that dissimilar people are actively disliked (Aboud, 1989). Recognising what sets you apart
from others and then forming negative opinions about those outgroups (a social group with which an
individual does not identify) contributes to the development of implicit biases."

Inﬂuences from media, culture, education, and your individual
upbringing can also contribute to the rise of implicit associations that people form about the members
of social outgroups. Media has become increasingly accessible, and while that has many beneﬁts, it
can also lead to implicit biases."

How children are raised can also play an important role. One research study found that parental racial
attitudes can inﬂuence children’s implicit prejudice (Sinclair et al., 2005). Parents are not the only
ﬁgures who can inﬂuence such attitudes. Siblings, the school setting, and the culture in which you
grow up can also play a role in shaping your explicit beliefs and implicit biases."
