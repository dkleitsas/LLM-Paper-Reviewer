ABSTRACT,0.005434782608695652,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.010869565217391304,"Adversarial Propagation (AdvProp) is an effective way to improve recognition
models, leveraging adversarial examples. Nonetheless, AdvProp suffers from the
extremely slow training speed, mainly because: a) extra forward and backward
passes are required for generating adversarial examples; b) both original samples
and their adversarial counterparts are used for training (i.e., 2× data). In this
paper, we introduce Fast AdvProp, which aggressively revamps AdvProp’s costly
training components, rendering the method nearly as cheap as the vanilla training.
Speciﬁcally, our modiﬁcations in Fast AdvProp are guided by the hypothesis
that disentangled learning with adversarial examples is the key for performance
improvements, while other training recipes (e.g., paired clean and adversarial
training samples, multi-step adversarial attackers) could be largely simpliﬁed.
Our empirical results show that, compared to the vanilla training baseline, Fast
AdvProp is able to further model performance on a spectrum of visual bench-
marks, without incurring extra training cost. Additionally, our ablations ﬁnd
Fast AdvProp scales better if larger models are used, is compatible with exist-
ing data augmentation methods (i.e., Mixup and CutMix), and can be easily
adapted to other recognition tasks like object detection. The code is available
here: https://github.com/meijieru/fast_advprop."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.021739130434782608,"Deep neural networks are highly successful for visual recognition. As fueled by powerful computa-
tional resources and massive amounts of data, deep networks achieve compelling, sometimes even
superhuman, performance on a wide range of visual benchmarks. However, when testing out of the
box, these exemplary models are usually get criticized for lacking generalization/robustness—an
increasing amount of works point out that deep neural networks are brittle at handling out-of-domain
situations like natural image corruptions (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2018), images with shifted styles
(Geirhos et al., 2018; Hendrycks et al., 2020), etc."
INTRODUCTION,0.02717391304347826,"Adversarial propagation (AdvProp) (Xie et al., 2020), which additionally feeds networks with
adversarial examples during training, emerged as one of the most effective ways to train not only
accurate but also robust deep neural networks. The key in AdvProp is to apply separate batch
normalization (BN) layers (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) to clean training samples and adversarial training
samples, as they come from different underlying distributions. Later works further explore the
potential of AdvProp on other learning tasks, including object detection (Chen et al., 2021b; Xu
et al., 2021), contrastive learning (Jiang et al., 2020; Ho & Vasconcelos, 2020; Xu & Yang, 2020) and
large-batch training (Liu et al., 2022)."
INTRODUCTION,0.03260869565217391,"However, the beneﬁts brought by AdvProp do not come for “free”—AdvProp introduces a signiﬁcant
amount of additional training cost, which is mainly incurred by generating and augmenting adversarial
training samples. For instance, compared to the vanilla training baseline (where only clean images are
involved), the default setting in AdvProp (Xie et al., 2020) increase the total computational cost by
factor of 7, i.e., 5/7 from generating adversarial examples, 1/7 from training adversarial examples, 1/7
from training clean images. This extremely high training cost not only limits the further explorations
of AdvProp on larger networks (Xie et al., 2019; Brock et al., 2021; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), with
larger datasets (Sun et al., 2017; Kuznetsova et al., 2020), and for different learning tasks, but also
makes the direct comparisons against other low-cost learning algorithms (Zhang et al., 2018; DeVries
& Taylor, 2017; Yun et al., 2019; Cubuk et al., 2019b;a) seemingly unfair."

INTRODUCTION,0.11413043478260869,"Figure 1: Comparison between AdvProp and Fast AdvProp. (a) AdvProp generates a paired adversar-
ial image (with color orange) for each clean image (with color blue) in the sampled batch, therefore
incurring heavy training cost. Moreover, in addition to clean images, adversarial images are also fed
into networks for training, therefore further increasing the total training cost, i.e., 2x data is used
here compared to the vanilla training. (b) Different from AdvProp, Fast AdvProp only uses a small
portion of the sampled batch to generate adversarial examples. Moreover, during the generation of
adversarial images, the gradient calculation of input images and the gradient calculation of network
parameters are merged into the same forward and backward pass as in (Shafahi et al., 2019; Zhang
et al., 2019), therefore making generating adversarial examples for “free”."
INTRODUCTION,0.11956521739130435,"In this paper, we present Fast AdvProp, which can run as cheaply as the vanilla training baseline in
practice. In particular, noting the most costly training components in AdvProp are (1) generating
adversarial examples where multiple forward passes and backward passes are additionally required,
and (2) training with both clean samples and their adversarial counterparts therefore the size of
training data gets doubled, Fast AdvProp revamps the original training pipeline as the following:"
INTRODUCTION,0.125,"• Firstly, though both clean training samples and their adversarial counterparts are default
components in traditional adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Kurakin et al., 2017),
we argue such pairing behavior is not a fundamental request by AdvProp. Speciﬁcally,
in Fast AdvProp, we reposition adversarial examples solely as a bonus part for network
training, i.e., networks now are expected to train with a mixture of a large portion of clean
images and a small portion of adversarial examples. This adjustment on training data helps
lower down training cost. Though the total number of adversarial training examples is
reduced, our empirical results verify this strategy is sufﬁcient to let networks gain robust
feature representations.
• Secondly, we integrate the recent techniques on accelerating adversarial training (Wong
et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2019; Shafahi et al., 2019) into AdvProp, mainly for reducing
the complexity of generating adversarial examples. However, this is non-trivial—naively
adopting these fast adversarial training techniques will collapse the training, resulting in
suboptimal model performance. We identify such failure is caused by the “label leaking”
effect (Kurakin et al., 2017), which largely weakens the regularization power imposed
by adversarial training samples. We further note this leakage comes from the intra-batch
communication among training samples in the same mini-batch, and resolve it via shufﬂing
BN (He et al., 2020). Additionally, we ﬁnd a) re-balancing the importance between clean
training samples and adversarial training samples and b) synchronizing parameter updating
speed are the other two key ingredients for ensuring Fast AdvProp’s improvements."
INTRODUCTION,0.13043478260869565,"Our empirical results demonstrate that Fast AdvProp can successfully improve recognition models
for “free”. For instance, without incurring any extra training cost, Fast AdvProp helps ResNet-50 (He
et al., 2016) outperforms its vanilla counterpart by 0.3% on ImageNet, 2.1% on ImageNet-C, 1.9%
on ImageNet-R and 0.5% on Stylized-ImageNet. Furthermore, such “free lunch” can consistently
be observed when Fast AdvProp is applied to networks at different scales, combined with various
data augmentation strategies, and adapted to other recognition tasks. By easing the computational
barriers, we hope this work can encourage the community to further explore the potential of AdvProp
(or adversarial learning in general) on developing better deep learning models."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.14673913043478262,"Adversarial training. Adversarial training (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015), which
trains networks with adversarial examples that are generated on the ﬂy, is one of the most effective
ways for defending against adversarial attacks. Nonetheless, compared to vanilla training, adversarial
training signiﬁcantly increases the computational overhead, mainly due to the high complexity of
generating adversarial examples."
RELATED WORK,0.15217391304347827,"To this end, many efforts have been devoted to accelerating adversarial training. Both (Shafahi et al.,
2019) and (Zhang et al., 2019) propose to merge the gradient for adversarial attacks and the gradient
for network parameter updates into a single forward and backward pass to reduce computations.
Wong et al. (Wong et al., 2020) alternatively argue that the cheapest adversarial attacker, Fast Gradient
Sign Method (FGSM) (Goodfellow et al., 2015), actually can train robust classiﬁers, if combined
with random initialization. This work is further enhanced by (Andriushchenko & Flammarion, 2020)
to explicitly maximizing the gradient alignment inside the perturbation set for enhancing the quality
of the FGSM solution. In this work, we aim to integrate these fast adversarial training techniques into
AdvProp, for reducing the overhead of generating adversarial training samples."
RELATED WORK,0.15760869565217392,"Adversarial propagation. It is generally believed that adversarial training hurts generalization
(Raghunathan et al., 2019). Adversarial propagation (AdvProp) (Xie et al., 2020), a special form of
adversarial training, challenges this belief by showing training with adversarial examples actually
can improve recognition models. The key is to utilize an additional set of batch normalization layers
exclusively for the adversarial images (or more importantly, as suggested in (Chen et al., 2021a), by
applying a different set of rescaling parameters in batch normalization layers), as they have different
underlying distributions to clean examples. Later works further explore the potential of AdvProp
on other recognition tasks (Chen et al., 2021b; Xu et al., 2021; Shu et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021a;
Xie & Yuille, 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Gong et al., 2021), under different learning paradigms (Jiang
et al., 2020; Ho & Vasconcelos, 2020; Xu & Yang, 2020), with different adversarial data (Merchant
et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Herrmann et al., 2021), enabling extremely large-batch training (Liu et al.,
2022), etc. In this paper, rather than furthering performance, we aim to make AdvProp “free”."
RELATED WORK,0.16304347826086957,"Data augmentation. Data augmentation, which effectively increases the size and the diversity of
the training dataset, is crucial for the success of deep neural networks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012;
Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; Szegedy et al., 2015; He et al., 2016). Popular ways for augmenting
data include geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation), color jittering (e.g., brightness,
contrast), mixing images (Zhang et al., 2018; Yun et al., 2019; DeVries & Taylor, 2017), etc."
RELATED WORK,0.16847826086956522,"Training with adversarial examples (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021b) can
be regarded as a special way to augment data—different from traditional data augmentation strategies
which are usually ﬁxed and model agnostic, the policy of generating adversarial examples is jointly
evolved with the model updating throughout the whole training process. This behavior ensures the
augmentation policy of adversarial examples stays current and relevant. Nonetheless, a signiﬁcant
drawback of augmenting adversarial examples is that the introduced computational overhead is much
more expensive than that of traditional augmentation strategies. We hereby aim to make training with
adversarial examples as cheap as other data augmentation strategies."

performance (i.e., 66.8% vs. 77.0% on ImageNet), even making the resulted model attains much
lower performance than the vanilla training baseline. Moreover, we verify that applying the cheapest
PGD-1 training (i.e., FGSM + random initialization as in (Wong et al., 2020)) to AdvProp still leads

tion leakage When attacking using batch
statistics, we observe the training accuracy
is unreasonably high, as shown in Figure
2. The network could classify images by
“cheating” since we use the same batch for
attacking and training, and the intra-batch
information exchange introduced by BN
leaks information. We use shufﬂing BN
(He et al., 2020) to resolve this problem.
Before feeding the adversarial images on
each GPU into the network, we shufﬂe
the generated adversarial examples across
the multiple GPUs. This ensures the batch
statistics for the images with random noise
and the adversarial images come from dif-
ferent subsets, therefore preventing information leakage."

INCORPORATING FREE ADVERSARIAL TRAINING TECHNIQUES,0.44565217391304346,"Re-balancing training samples. By reusing the gradient, the images used for adversarial attack
involve two forward and backward passes (i.e., one for generating adversarial examples, and one for
training with adversarial examples), while the clean images involve only one forward and backward
pass. With the intuition that each image within the batch should have the same importance, we
propose to halve the importance of the images used for adversarial attack. In another perspective,
the adversarial images and their intermediate products (i.e., the images with random noise) are two
kinds of augmentations on the original images. Based on the argument in (Hoffer et al., 2020) that
the overall importance of an image should be the same w/ or w/o the repeated augmentations, we
therefore need to adjust the importance of the images with random noise and the importance of the
adversarial examples accordingly (i.e., setting β = 0.5 in Algorithm 1)."

tially reduce the training cost. Nonetheless, it causes problems when combining with the auxiliary
BNs scheme. Speciﬁcally, the parameters of original BNs only receive the gradients from clean
images, the parameters of auxiliary BNs only receive the gradients from images with random noise
and adversarial examples, while the parameters of the shared layers receive gradients from all ex-
amples. The ratio between the gradient magnitude of shared layers/original BNs/auxiliary BNs is
1 : (1 −padv) : padv. The inconsistent updating speed of network parameters harms the performance.
To solve this problem, we re-scale the gradient to ensure the similar parameter updating speed."

for one step (K = 1) and set the perturbation size to 1.0. As discussed in Section 3.2.2, to ensure
the same importance of each example within a batch, we set β = 0.5 for halving the importance of

re-implementation of AdvProp achieves 77.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 0.8% higher than the
vanilla training baseline. We also evaluate robustness generalization on ImageNet-C, ImageNet-
R, Stylized-ImageNet; AdvProp also substantially outperforms the vanilla training baseline here.
However, the comparison is unfair as AdvProp using 7× training budget. In the fair comparison
setting, the performance of 15-epoch AdvProp (dividing the total epochs by 7) degrades signiﬁcantly,
i.e., its ImageNet accuracy is only 66.8%, which is 9.4% lower than the vanilla training baseline."
MAIN RESULTS,0.4945652173913043,"On the contrary, using exactly the same training budget as the vanilla setting, Fast AdvProp achieves
76.5% accuracy on ImageNet, which is 0.3% higher than the vanilla training baseline and signiﬁcantly

for all ResNet models, Fast AdvProp attains much higher performance than the 15-epoch AdvProp
baseline on ImageNet, ImageNet-C and ImageNet-R. The only exception is Stylized-ImageNet,
where 15-epoch AdvProp always attains the best performance. We conjecture this is mainly due to
a larger percentage of adversarial data is used during training, therefore letting the learned feature
representation be biased towards shape cues (Geirhos et al., 2018; Zhang & Zhu, 2019)."

can draw a clear conclusion that the larger the padv, the more inferior top-1 accuracy we achieved.
Speciﬁcally, using 50% images as adversarial examples only gets 75.4% accuracy, which is 0.9%
lower than the vanilla training. This comes from the fact that as padv increases, the training cost
in one epoch increases (calculated using Equation 4), therefore the total training epoch needs to be
reduced for keeping the training cost unchanged. In addition, reducing padv from 0.20 to 0.11 does
not further decrease the model accuracy, suggesting its value is fairly robust in a certain range. If we
further decrease padv to 0, then our method degenerates to the vanilla training baseline."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.6684782608695652,"AdvProp is an effective method to get accurate and robust networks. However, it suffers from
extremely high training costs. We propose the decoupled training where networks are expected
to train with only a small portion of adversarial examples but a large portion of clean images,
therefore reducing the training cost signiﬁcantly. In addition, we succeed in reusing the gradient
when generating adversarial examples. Empirically, our Fast AdvProp effectively and efﬁciently
helps network gain better performance without incurring extra training cost. We believe our method
will speed up the iteration of future works and accelerating the research on adversarial learning."

DO WE NEED RANDOM INITIALIZATION IN PGD ATTACK?"
REFERENCES,0.9945652173913043,"Here we focus on ablating the effects of the random initialization in PGD attacker on Fast AdvProp.
Note that removing the random initialization simpliﬁes the PGD-1 attacker to the FGSM attacker.
Though, as discussed in (Wong et al., 2020), the random initialization is the key step for enabling
successful adversarial training, we observe Fast AdvProp behaves robustly under such situation—it
achieves 76.46% top-1 ImageNet accuracy (using FGSM), which closely matches the situation when
random initialization is applied (i.e., 76.53% top-1 ImageNet accuracy, using PGD-1)."
