ABSTRACT,0.005291005291005291,"Classical chest X-ray analysis has designed radiomic features to indicate the
characteristics of abnormality of the chest X-rays. However, extracting reliable
radiomic features heavily hinges on pathology localization, which is often absent
in real-world image data. Although the past decade has witnessed the promising
performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in analyzing chest X-rays,
most of them ignored domain knowledge such as radiomics. Recently, the surge of
Transformers in computer vision has suggested a promising substitute for CNNs.
It can encode highly expressive and generalizable representations and avoid costly
manual annotations via a unique implementation of the self-attention mechanism.
Moreover, Transformers naturally suit the feature extraction and fusion from
different input modalities. Inspired by its recent success, this paper proposes
CheXT, the ﬁrst Transformer-based chest X-ray model. CheXT targets (semi-
supervised) abnormality classiﬁcation and localization from chest X-rays, enhanced
by baked-in auxiliary knowledge guidance using radiomics. Speciﬁcally, CheXT
consists of an image branch and a radiomics branch, interacted by cross-attention
layers. During training, the image branch leverages its learned attention to estimate
pathology localization, which is then utilized to extract radiomic features from
images in the radiomics branch. Therefore, the two branches in CheXT are deeply
fused and constitute an end-to-end optimization loop that can bootstrap accurate
pathology localization from image data without any bounding box used for training.
Extensive experiments on the NIH chest X-ray dataset demonstrate that CheXT
signiﬁcantly outperforms existing baselines in disease classiﬁcation (by 1.1% in
average AUCs) and localization (by a signiﬁcant average margin of 3.6% over
different IoU thresholds). Codes and models will be publicly released."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.015873015873015872,"In medical study, handcrafted radiomics (Zwanenburg et al., 2016) refers to the process of extracting
several quantitative and semiquantitative features from medical images for improved decision support.
It has the potential to uncover disease characteristics that are difﬁcult to identify by viewing raw
images alone. Given their advantages, researchers have explored the performance of radiomic features
for chest X-ray analysis. For example, (Shi et al.; Saygılı, 2021) extracted a set of radiomic features
to diagnose different types of pneumonia. (Bai et al., 2020) proposed a hybrid model to encode the
combination of radiomic features and clinical information. (Ghosh et al., 2020) presented a new
handcrafted feature to distinguish between severe and nonsevere patients. However, all the above
methods rely on accurate pathology localization annotations to extract radiomic features from the
correct “region of interest” (aka bounding boxes) but not other irrelevant parts(Van Griethuysen et al.,
2017). Such bounding boxes are usually expensive and time-consuming to acquire by humans and, if
inaccurate, will tremendously degrade the reliability of radiomic features. There is thus an unmet
need to automatically localize pathologies on chest X-rays to facilitate radiomic features extraction."
INTRODUCTION,0.021164021164021163,"Under the rapid development of deep learning, many researchers have made their efforts to utilize the
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in building automated systems of chest X-ray abnormality

2019b; Rozenberg et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). However, CNN methods witness several limitations."

INTRODUCTION,0.0582010582010582,"First, chest X-rays own valuable domain knowl-
edge and domain-speciﬁc features, such as ra-
diomic features. Thus, they could have blessed
better recognition but are unfortunately over-
looked by most CNNs. Second, chest X-rays
have more subtle discriminative features com-
pared to natural images, making their recogni-
tion more challenging. Finally, CNNs are often
criticized for being non-transparent and their
predictions not traceable by humans, hence hin-
ders their acceptance and adoption by clinicians."
INTRODUCTION,0.06349206349206349,"Why Transformers for Chest X-rays?
The
latest surge of transformers provides a promis-
ing alternative to model chest X-rays. Trans-
former was ﬁrst prevailing to Natural Language
Processing (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al.,
2018; Brown et al., 2020), followed by its recent
success in computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al.,
2020; Carion et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) and
multi-modal learning (Ying et al., 2021). It is an
“universal modeling tool” that can unify the fea-
ture extraction and fusion from different input
modalities within one model, without domain-
speciﬁc model tweaks. For example, (Akbari
et al., 2021) demonstrated to learn powerful multi-modal representations from unlabeled video, audio,
and text data, using one Transformer architecture."
INTRODUCTION,0.06878306878306878,"Bringing that into the context of chest X-rays, we see the tantalizing potential that a Transformer
could organically and jointly learn from two views of chest X-rays: (i) raw X-ray images that contain
the richest details, hence beneﬁting from the data-driven learning capacity; and (ii) radiomic features
that encode critical domain prior knowledge, hence effectively guiding and regularizing the learning
process. The appeal of Transformers is, however, blocked by a “chicken-and-egg” problem: as
aforementioned, the extraction of reliable radiomic features hinge on the pathology localization, but
then the pathology localization is often absent in images and also needs to be learned ﬁrst."
INTRODUCTION,0.07407407407407407,"This paper presents a holistic framework of Knowledge-Guided Cross-Attention Transformer for
Chest X-ray analysis, named CheXT (Figure 1). CheXT consists of two Transformer-based branches
that learn from two data formats characterizing the same patient: the image and radiomics branches.
Both are deeply fused and interacted by cross-attention layers (Chen et al., 2021a). Notably, the
radiomic features need be extracted from the learned pathology localizations, which are not readily
available. The key enabling technology to resolve this hurdle, is to construct a “feedback loop” during
training: the image branch leverages its learned attention to estimating pathology localization, which
is then utilized to extract radiomic features from images in the radiomics branch. Training under
a uniﬁed contrastive loss, such an end-to-end optimization loop can bootstrap accurate pathology
localization from image data, with no bounding boxes used for training. Our contributions are
outlined as follows:"
INTRODUCTION,0.07936507936507936,"• We leverage the radiomic feature as an “auxiliary input modality” correlated with the raw
image modality and encoded with domain knowledge. We then propose a novel knowledge-

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.1111111111111111,"Radiomics in Medical Diagnosis. The design of radiomics involves biological and medical data
and prior knowledge. Thus, radiomics vastly enriches images and expands the horizons of the image
toward in-vivo biologic information extraction (Gillies et al., 2016). In image-based biomarkers
for cancer staging and prognostication, radiomics had shown promising power (Nasief et al., 2019).
Radiomics extracts quantitative data from medical images to represent tumor phenotypes, such as
spatial heterogeneity of a tumor and spatial response variations. (Eilaghi et al., 2017) demonstrated
that radiomic of CT texture features are associated with the overall survival rate of pancreatic cancer.
(Chen et al., 2017) revealed that the ﬁrst-order radiomic features (e.g., mean, skewness, and kurtosis)
are correlated with pathological responses to cancer treatment. (Huang et al., 2018) showed that
radiomics could increase the positive predictive value and reduce the false-positive rate in lung
cancer screening for small nodules compared with radiologists. (Zhang et al., 2018) found that
multiparametric MRI-based radiomics nomograms provided improved prognostic ability in advanced
nasopharyngeal carcinoma."
RELATED WORK,0.1164021164021164,"In comparison, deep learning is often criticized for being a “black box” and lacks interpretability
despite high predictive accuracy. This limitation has motivated many interpretable learning techniques
including activation maximization (Erhan et al., 2009), network inversion (Mahendran & Vedaldi,
2015), GradCAM (Selvaraju et al., 2016), and network dissection (Bau et al., 2017). We believe that
the joint utilization of radiomics and interpretable learning techniques in our framework can further
advance accurate yet interpretable learning in the medical image domain."
RELATED WORK,0.12169312169312169,"Transformers for Medical Images. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020)
achieved state-of-the-art classiﬁcation on ImageNet by directly applying Transformers with global
self-attention to full-sized images. Inspired by the promising performance of ViT, researchers have
recently applied the idea to medical images. For example, (Oktay et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Chen
et al., 2021b) used the attention mechanism to boost the performance of medical image segmentation.
(Valanarasu et al., 2021) proposed a gated axial-attention model to introduce an additional control
mechanism in the self-attention module. (Park et al., 2021) utilized a hybrid framework of CNN and
Transformer for Covid-19 prediction. However, those methods did not consider any domain prior
knowledge. (Han et al., 2021) applied pre-extracted radiomic features to guide pneumonia detection
from chest X-ray images. However, they adopted a convolutional backbone for image encoder, while
using a another speciﬁcally crafted radiomic features encoder. Therefore, the method involves no
joint interaction between image and radiomic features, and need to use accurate bounding boxes
during training in order to extract radiomic features. Hence, their method dramatically limits usability
in clinical practice."

hyperparameters for training. The only difference is that we use a more shallow PS-ViT with 6 layers.
For the radiomic branch encoder, since the radiomic features are already informative features, we
use a more shallow Transformer (1-layers) to encode the radiomic features. And we add one more
cross-attention layer to fuse these two format features. We set the batch size as 128 and train the
model for 50 epochs (5 warm-up epochs). Other setup includes a cosine linear-rate scheduler with a
linear warm-up, an initial learning rate of 0.004, and a weight decay of 0.05. During the evaluation,
we resize the image to 256×256 and take the center crop 224×224 as the input."

as CheXT (Table 2). Unlike other baselines(Li et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019a) that use a portion
of 880 images for evaluation (because they need the remaining data for training), we used all 880
annotated images for evaluation. Therefore, no k-fold cross-validation for localization was performed.
CheXT average performance across 8 diseases is signiﬁcantly better than the baseline under all IoU
thresholds. When the thresholds of IoU is set to 0.1, CheXT outperforms the baseline (Wang et al.,
2017) in Cardiomegaly, Inﬁltration, Mass, and Pneumonia. Even with higher thresholds, our model
performs superior to baseline. For example, when evaluated at T(IoU) = 0.5, our “Cardiomegaly”
accuracy is still 32%, while the reference model achieves only 18%. Our “Pneumonia” accuracy
is 12%, while the reference model has only 3% accuracy. Note that some diseases can appear at
multiple places, but ground truth might have mentioned only one location. This can signiﬁcantly
impact the accuracy at high thresholds. More importantly, we also add the ViT as our additional
baseline here, the results show that the radiomics branch and BYOA module can help the model
learn more important regions, which also improves the model’s interpretability. Few examples of the
localization results of ViT and CheXT are shown in Figure 5."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.7142857142857143,"In this paper, we propose an end-to-end knowledge-guided cross-attention Transformer, named
CheXT that can jointly model abnormality classiﬁcation and localization without the supervision
of localization annotation of chest X-rays. Our approach differs from previous studies in the
choice of universal modeling transformer, the use of radiomic features as prior knowledge, and a
feedback loop for image and radiomic features to mutually interact with each other. Additionally,
the project aims to mitigate current gaps in radiology by making prior knowledge more accessible to
image data analytic and diagnostic assisting tools, with the hope that this will increase the model’s
interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
algorithms, especially for the disease localization task, where our method can generate more accurate
bounding boxes."
