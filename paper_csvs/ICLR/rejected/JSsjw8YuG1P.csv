ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.004484304932735426,"Personalized medical systems are rapidly gaining traction as opposed to “one size
ﬁts all” systems. Predicting patients’ lab test responses and providing justiﬁca-
tion for the predictions would help clinicians tailor treatment regimes for patients.
This requires modeling the complex interactions among different medications, dis-
eases, and lab tests. We need to learn a strong patient representation that captures
both the sequential information accumulated over the visits and information from
other similar patients. We model drug-lab interactions and diagnosis-lab interac-
tions as graphs and design a knowledge-augmented approach to predict patients’
response for a target lab result. We also take into consideration patients’ past
lab responses to personalize the prediction. Experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in reducing prediction er-
rors by a signiﬁcant margin. Case studies show that the identiﬁed factors for
inﬂuencing the predicted results are consistent with clinicians’ understanding."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.013452914798206279,"Electronic Health Records (EHR) provide a rich repository of patient related information such as
disease diagnosis, lab test results, prescribed medications, etc. over a history of visits. Advances in
machine learning have led to the large-scale analytics of EHR for disease inference (Ni et al., 2017),
mortality prediction (Tan et al., 2019), personalized medication recommendation (Wang et al., 2019;
Shang et al., 2019; Bhoi et al., 2021). At the same time, there is a growing trend towards using pa-
tient analytics for decision support (Oei et al., 2021) to improve patient care and clinical outcomes,
particularly in chronic disease management such as hypertension and diabetes. Often, these chronic
disease patients are prescribed some standard treatment regime for each chronic condition indepen-
dently and their conditions are monitored periodically based on lab test results such as HbA1c1.
However, for patients with co-morbidities, studies have shown that their lab test results are often
inﬂuenced by other treatments related to their co-morbidities, making it hard to assess the effective-
ness of the prescribed treatment (Unnikrishnan et al., 2012). The ability to predict the target lab test
result of a patient’s condition, taking into consideration medications that are prescribed for his/her
other conditions, would enable the clinician to personalize the treatment regime for the patient. This
can help eliminate invasive procedures associated with sample collection for the lab test."
INTRODUCTION,0.017937219730941704,"Existing research use patient speciﬁc information such as demographics and past visit records to
predict lab test results (Luo et al., 2016; Kang, 2018). The work in Luo et al. (2016) predicts Ferritin
lab test result by using patient demographics and the results of other lab tests that have been ordered
at the same time as the Ferritin lab test. Kang (2018) examines the task of predicting HbA1c test
results and proposes a recurrent neural network (RNN) based architecture to model the sequential
dependencies across the past visits. These works do not consider the impact of medications on the
target lab test result. For example, patients with high blood pressure are prescribed medications like
Propranolol which is known to increase HbA1c (Dornhorst et al., 1985)."
INTRODUCTION,0.02242152466367713,"In practice, lab test results are often inﬂuenced by drugs and diagnosis. However, these drug-lab
interactions and diagnosis-lab interactions are largely ignored by current works on lab response
predictions. We observe that drug-lab interaction can be positive where the drug increases the lab
test value, or negative where the lab test value is decreased by the drug, e.g., HbA1c is increased"

INTRODUCTION,0.03587443946188341,"by Propranolol and decreased by Metformin (Dornhorst et al., 1985; Gonz´alez-Ortiz et al., 2012).
Similarly, diagnosis-lab interaction can be positive or negative, e.g., HbA1c is increased by iron
deﬁciency anemia and decreased by hemolytic anemia (Program, 2013)."
INTRODUCTION,0.04035874439461883,"In this work, we use a transformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017) to capture the patient speciﬁc
information, while the information of similar patients is modeled using the modiﬁed graph attention
network (GATv2)(Brody et al., 2021). We combine the outputs from both the transformer encoder
and the GATv2 to obtain a strong latent patient representation so as to accurately predict patient
response to a target lab test. We incorporate ﬁne-grained dosage information to increase the accuracy
of the predictions in the presence of medication titrations for chronic disease patient management.
This is in contrast to existing works which mainly consider medication type."
INTRODUCTION,0.04484304932735426,"We augment the patient representation with the knowledge of drug-lab interactions, diagnosis-lab
interactions, and use graph attention networks to model the positive and negative effects of drugs and
diagnosis on the target lab result. This enables us to model the complex relationships between drugs,
co-morbidities, and lab test results. We also take into consideration patients’ past lab responses to
personalize the prediction. Finally, we leverage the attention weights in the proposed solution to
identify the top factors that may have inﬂuenced the predicted lab test results. This allows clinicians
to have insight into the underlying cause for any changes in the lab test result. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments on the benchmark MIMIC-III (Johnson et al., 2016) EHR and a propri-
etary outpatient dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system to signiﬁcantly lower
the prediction errors by a large margin. Case studies reveal the usefulness of identifying the factors
that contributed to the predicted lab test results."

RELATED WORKS"
RELATED WORKS,0.053811659192825115,"Lab test prediction has been studied for the purpose of clinical decision support. The work in (Luo
et al., 2016) employs multiple machine learning algorithms to predict Ferritin test response from
patient demographics and other accompanying lab test responses from EHR. (Kang et al., 2015) uses
an ensemble of support vector machines to predict HbA1c test results using patient demographics,
prescribed medications, and the last known HbA1c value. (Kang et al., 2017) proposes to use a
heterogeneous ensemble of classiﬁers and reduces the prediction error by incorporating an option to
reject an instance when the conﬁdence of any of the classiﬁers is low. These methods rely on only the
current patient visit information and ignore the sequential dependency of past patient visits. (Kang,
2018) proposes a recurrent neural network based architecture to model the sequential dependencies
across the visits for the task of prediction of HbA1c test results. Given the black-box nature of
RNN, this approach is unable to identify the factors that contribute to the lab test result prediction.
In contrast, our solution is able to highlight these factors via attention based mechanism."
RELATED WORKS,0.05829596412556054,"Learning a strong latent patient representation is key to the accurate prediction of lab test results.
The work in (Choi et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2017) use a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a bi-
directional RNN respectively to create a patient representation for disease prediction by capturing
the sequential dependency in medical codes over time. Similarly, T-LSTM (Baytas et al., 2017) pro-
poses time aware long-short term memory for patient subtyping. DMNC (Le et al., 2018) learns the
patient representation by infusing memory augmented neural networks (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) with
RNNs to handle long-range dependencies in patient visit history. Recent works have demonstrated
the superiority of transformer encoder representations over RNN based approaches in capturing the
sequential dependency in EHR for disease prediction (Li et al., 2020), mortality prediction (Darabi
et al., 2020), medication recommendation (Prakash et al., 2021). HiTANet (Luo et al., 2020) intro-
duces a time-aware transformer to obtain a patient representation using local and global attention
for risk prediction. BEHRT (Li et al., 2020) adapts Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al.,
2019) based architecture to learn patient representation using patient’s diagnostic and demographic
information to predict future disease occurrence. All these works do not consider information from
other similar patients and do not use ﬁne-grained dosage information."
RELATED WORKS,0.06278026905829596,"Recently, (Lu et al., 2021) model patient similarity and incorporate clinical notes for the task of
diagnosis and heart failure prediction. This work uses the ontology of diseases along with the patient
diagnosis information to jointly learn the representation for patients and diseases. Our work differs
from this in that our notion of patient similarity includes demographics, prescribed medications
information in addition to disease diagnosis to predict lab test responses."

between. The multi-head attention employs scaled dot-product attention to obtain the weights on the
patient visits given the visit history. Since this multi-head attention can attend to future time steps, to
ensure that the model’s predictions are only conditioned on past visits, we apply a triangular mask
to the embedding de
i and me
i. This mask is the same as the one used in the decoder component
of (Vaswani et al., 2017). The input to the ith encoder in the ﬁrst layer is the concatenation of de

KALP3 is implemented in PyTorch and the models are trained on two NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU. We
adopt the widely used metrics for regression namely, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute
error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in our evaluation (see Appendix A.1).
We use the following datasets in our experiments:"

tains clinical data for 7870 neonates (infants) and 38,597 adults admitted to ICU between 2001 and
2008, and captures attributes such as lab reports, medications, etc."

to demographics and diagnosis."
PERFORMANCE STUDY,0.49327354260089684,"Table 1 shows that KALP outperforms all baselines on both MIMIC-III and PRIVATE. The one-
way ANOVA (Fisher, 1992) test shows that the improvements are statistically signiﬁcant with p-
values < 0.05. Compared to DMNC and BEHRT which model only sequential dependency of a
patient’s visits over time, we see that our knowledge augmented approach dramatically widens the
performance gap. This suggests that incorporating similar patients, lab interactions and past lab test
responses is effective in lowering the prediction errors. The ablation study in Appendix A.4 shows
the effect of different information sources. Using different neural architectures show that KALP
continues to give good performance over existing methods (see Appendix A.5)."

ability to identify the top inﬂuencing factors that led to its lab result predictions. The top inﬂuencing
factors can be obtained from the attention weights (recall Section 3.3)."
CASE STUDY,0.5201793721973094,"Figure 5 shows a chronic diabetic patient with HbA1c ranging between 5.4 and 6.5. KALP is
able to predict the HbA1c to an accuracy of 0.2 while the state-of-the-art BEHRT has a prediction
error as large as 0.7 (Visit 4). On visit 3, we see that KALP predicted the HbA1c to be 5.5 while
BEHRT predicted it to be 5.1. The top inﬂuencing factor for this prediction is the past lab response.
This highlights that taking into consideration patients’ past responses helps in personalizing the
prediction. Further for Visit 4, we again see that KALP is able to predict the rise in the HbA1c value
within 0.1 of the ground truth value compared to BEHRT. A closer examination reveals that there is
a reduction in the dosage of Glipizide on visit 3 and KALP has attributed the top inﬂuencing factor
for this prediction to be the reduction in dosage of Glipizide."
CASE STUDY,0.5246636771300448,"To the best of our knowledge, KALP is the only system that takes into account dosage information
when making lab test predictions. In practice, clinicians often need to adjust medication treatment
to manage patient care. With KALP’s ability to model medication dosages, we have demonstrated
here a highly accurate prediction for the target lab test result. Appendix A.6 provides additional case
studies to demonstrate the importance of modeling other patient information such as medication
dosage, patients’ past lab responses."

CONCLUSION"
CASE STUDY,0.5336322869955157,"In this work, we have described a personalized lab test result prediction approach that learns a strong
patient representation incorporating both patient information accumulated over the visits as well as
information from similar patients. This representation also captures ﬁne-grained dosage information
enabling us to adjust the prediction in response to changes in treatment regime, which is often needed
in the management of chronic patient care. To increase the prediction accuracy for patients with
complex co-morbidities, we have augmented the patient representation with external knowledge on
lab interactions and patients’ historical responses to the target lab test. Experimental results on two
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KALP in providing predictions that are close
to the actual lab results. Future work includes extending KALP to incorporate information on the
severity and frequency of lab interactions. Further, KALP only uses the structured information
in the EHR. However, EHR encompasses a plethora of information in the form of doctors’ notes,
physiological signals, and medical images. One promising direction would be to jointly model these
multi-modal sources in KALP."

response."

his ﬁrst visit to the clinic and is diagnosed with Acute upper respiratory infection, Hyperlipidemia,
Diabetes mellitus. We see that KALP is able to accurately predict the HbA1c values within a 0.1
margin, whereas BEHRT’s margin of error tends to be larger, particularly for the prediction at Visit
5. This is because prior to Visit 5, there is a downward titration of Metformin and the reduced dosage
may lead to an increase in the HbA1c value. KALP is able to infer the rise in HbA1c values as it has
captured the medication dosage in its patient representation, whereas BEHRT does not capture such
dosage information. This is conﬁrmed by the top inﬂuencing factors for Visit 5 where the top factor
is indicated as the reduced dosage in Metformin."
