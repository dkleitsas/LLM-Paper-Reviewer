ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.004366812227074236,"Real world tournaments are almost always intransitive. Recent works have noted
that parametric models which assume d dimensional node representations can
effectively model intransitive tournaments (Rajkumar & Agarwal (2016)). How-
ever, nothing is known about the structure of the class of tournaments that arise
out of any ﬁxed d dimensional representations. In this work, we develop a novel
theory for understanding parametric tournament representations. Our ﬁrst contri-
bution is to structurally characterize the class of tournaments that arise out of d
dimensional representations. We do this by showing that these tournament classes
have forbidden conﬁgurations which must necessarily be union of ﬂip classes, a
novel way to partition the set of all tournaments. We further characterize rank 2
tournaments completely by showing that the associated forbidden ﬂip class con-
tains just 2 tournaments. Speciﬁcally, we show that the rank 2 tournaments are
equivalent to locally-transitive tournaments. This insight allows us to show that
the minimum feedback arc set problem on this tournament class can be solved
using the standard Quicksort procedure. For a general rank d tournament class,
we show that the ﬂip class associated with a coned-doubly regular tournament of

a celebrated result of Forster & Simon (2006), we show a lower bound of Ω(√n)
on the minimum dimension needed to represent all tournaments on n nodes. For
any given tournament, we show a novel upper bound on the smallest representation
dimension that depends on the least size of the number of unique nodes in any
feedback arc set of the ﬂip class associated with a tournament. We show how our
results also shed light on upper bound of sign-rank of matrices."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.017467248908296942,"In this work, we lay the the foundations for a theory of tournament representations. A tournament is a
complete directed graph and arises naturally in several applications including ranking from pairwise
preferences, sports modeling, social choice, etc. We say that a tournament T on n nodes can be
represented in d dimensions if there exists a skew symmetric matrix M ∈Rn×n of rank d such
that a directed edge from i to j is present in T if and only if Mij > 0. Real world tournaments
are almost always intransitive (Tversky (1969); Klimenko (2015)) and it is not known what type of
tournaments can be represented in how many dimensions. This is important to understand because of
the following reason: As a modeler of preference relations using tournaments, it is often more natural
to have structural domain knowledge such as ‘The tournaments under consideration do not have
long cycles’ as opposed to algebraic domain knowledge such as ‘The rank of the skew symmetric
matrix associated with the tournaments of interest is at most k’. However, algorithms that learn
rankings from pairwise comparison data typically need as input the algebraic quantity - the rank
of the skew symmetric matrices associated with tournaments or equivalently the dimension where
they are represented (Rajkumar & Agarwal (2016)). To bridge the gap between the structural and
the algebraic world, we ask and answer two fundamental questions regarding the representations of
tournaments."

INTRODUCTION,0.06550218340611354,"We answer the ﬁrst question by investigating the intricate structure of the rank d tournament class
via the notion of forbidden conﬁgurations. Speciﬁcally, we show that the set of forbidden conﬁg-
uration for the rank d tournament class must necessarily be a union of ﬂip classes, a novel way to
partition the set of all tournaments into equivalence classes. We explicitly characterize the forbidden
conﬁgurations for the rank 2 tournament class and exhibit a forbidden conﬁguration for the general
rank d tournament class. Speciﬁcally, we show that the rank 2 tournaments are equivalent to locally
transitive tournaments, a previously studied class of tournaments (Cohen et al. (2004)). Our results
throw light on the connections between transitive and locally transitive tournaments and also lets us
develop a classic Quicksort based algorithm to solve that the minimum feedback arc set problem
on rank 2 tournaments with O(n2) time complexity. Our results for the general rank d tournament
class have connections to the classic long standing Hadamard conjecture and we discuss this as well.
Figure 1 gives a glimpse of some of the main results."
INTRODUCTION,0.06986899563318777,"We answer the second question by proving lower and upper bounds on the smallest dimension needed
to represent a tournament on n nodes. We exhibit a lower bound of Ω(√n) using a variation of the
celebrated dimension complexity result of Forster & Simon (2006) for sign matrices. To show upper
bounds, we introduce a novel parameter associated to a tournament called the Flip Feedback Node
set of a Tournament. This quantity depends on the least number of unique nodes in any feedback
arc set of an associated tournament class for the tournament of interest and upper bounds linearly
the representation dimension of any tournament. We show how our results can be used to provide
upper bounds on the classic notion of sign-rank of a matrix. Previously known upper bounds for sign
rank depended on the VC dimension of the associated binary function class (Alon et al. (2016)). Our
upper bounds on the other hand have a graph theoretic ﬂavour."

ranking model that can model intransitivity. However, their study and results were restricted to just
the transitive tournaments in these classes. A generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry-Luce
model (Bradley & Terry (1952), Luce (2012)) was studied in Causeur & Husson (2005). However,

tournament that necessitates the positive spanning property, it is not immediately clear in the rank 4
case. A ﬁrst guess would be to consider the regular tournaments (as the 3 cycle for rank 2 is also
a regular tournament) on 5 nodes or 7 nodes. However, these turn out to be insufﬁcient as one can
construct counter examples of regular tournaments on up to 7 nodes with representations that don’t

rank 4 class is the 7- doubly regular cone. However, we haven’t been able to prove this. This appears
to be a non-trivial problem. From our simulation experiments, we observe that the only ﬂip class
that could be forbidden on 8 nodes is the one that contains the 7-doubly regular cone. In particular,
we were able to produce examples of representations for all other ﬂip classes on 8 nodes. However,
this does not imply that the ones where we could not produce a forbidden conﬁguration is in fact
forbidden. Unfortunately, it seems tricky to prove this and we don’t have a way to show this at this

independent of the number of nodes n. The important reason for this signiﬁcantly improved bound
using µ(T) is that we consider only skew symmetric sign pattern matrices while Alon et al. (2016)
look at the worst case (w.r.t representation dimension/sign rank) sign pattern matrices for a ﬁxed VC

world situations, intransitivity is very common. To achieve intransitivity, the simplest way would

respectively. When two players compete, the advantage of the offense strength of player 1 w.r.t the
defense of player 2 and vice versa determine the outcome of the match. This is precisely captured by
a rank 2 model where the learning problem would be to infer these latent offense/defense strength

right subsets. As T is locally transitive, choosing any pivot i would correspond to ﬁxing the pivots
position and simply returning the ranking [σ(N −
i ), i, σ(N +
i )] where σ(N +
i ), σ(N −
i ) correspond to
the topological ordering of the transitive tournaments T(N +
i ) and T(N −
i ) respectively. We ﬁrst argue
that changing the pivot only cyclically shifts the ﬁnal ranking. To see why this is true, consider two
pivots i and j and their corresponding rankings σi and σj. Without loss of generality, assume that the
ranking σi = [1, . . . , n] and i >T j. We argue that there exists an integer k such that N +
j = {j + 1
mod n, (j + 2) mod n, . . . , (j + k) mod n} (where by convention n mod n = n). As N +
i is
transitive, and j is part of it, it must be the case that all the nodes {j + 1, . . . , j + n} ∈N +
j . Then to
prove the claim, it remains to be shown that the set N −
i ∩N +
j is either empty or must be the nodes
{1, . . . , ℓ} for some ℓ< i. If empty, we are done. If not, assume for the sake of contradiction that
there exists three succesive integers ℓa, ℓb, ℓc < i such that ℓa, ℓc <T j but ℓb >T j. It is easy to
verify that this cannot happen as it would lead to T({ℓa, ℓb, ℓc, j}) being a forbidden conﬁguration."

for E1,1, E1,2, E1,3, E2,2. If a similar procedure is carried out on T2 = (h2, . . . h8), another set of 4

from Ti by removing the ﬁrst entry and adding an entry to the end. Note that the tuples must have
unique entries. Therefore a ’circular elimination’ procedure can be followed, where the Ti tuples
considered are size 7 subsets of the circular permutations of h1, . . . h8. By following this procedure,
all the sign patterns remaining can be eliminated. Using size 7 circular permutations of h1, . . . h10 in
the last step does not eliminate all the cases, we believe this is due to nodes 1 to 8 forming a 7-DRT
cone, which leads to many eliminations. The code for the ﬁltration can be found here."
