ABSTRACT,0.002369668246445498,"Large language models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning skills, enabling robots
to comprehend natural language instructions and strategically plan high-level ac-
tions through proper grounding. However, LLM hallucination may result in robots
confidently executing plans that are misaligned with user goals or even unsafe in
critical scenarios. Additionally, inherent ambiguity in natural language instructions
can introduce uncertainty into the LLM’s reasoning and planning processes. We
propose introspective planning, a systematic approach that align LLM’s uncertainty
with the inherent ambiguity of the task. Our approach constructs a knowledge
base containing introspective reasoning examples as post-hoc rationalizations of
human-selected safe and compliant plans, which are retrieved during deployment.
Evaluations on three tasks, including a newly introduced safe mobile manipulation
benchmark, demonstrate that introspection substantially improves both compli-
ance and safety over state-of-the-art LLM-based planning methods. Furthermore,
we empirically show that introspective planning, in combination with conformal
prediction, achieves tighter confidence bounds, maintaining statistical success guar-
antees while minimizing unnecessary user clarification requests. The webpage and

Introduction"
INTRODUCTION,0.0071090047393364926,"Large Language Models (LLMs), when pre-trained on internet-scale text corpora, demonstrate
emergent capabilities that extend far beyond mere text comprehension and generation as their
scale increases [5, 40]. Through prompting [9] and in-context learning [26], these models have
shown remarkable adaptability ranging from answering complex questions and solving mathematical
problems to generating computer code and engaging in sophisticated reasoning processes during
inference [36]. Robots interacting with humans can leverage the capabilities of LLMs to interpret task
instructions in natural language, employ common sense reasoning to understand their environment,
and devise high-level action plans grounded in the capabilities and affordances of the robot [1, 21]."
INTRODUCTION,0.009478672985781991,"The reliability of LLM outputs has direct implications downstream robotics tasks. Language models
are prone to hallucinations [13], which cause models to generate plans that are at odds with common-
sense knowledge, not executable by the robot, or incompatible with the environment constraints [48].
For example, if a human user asks a robot to bake some bread in a kitchen containing an oven and
varied cookware, the robot’s LLM may generate a decision to use a plastic tray without considering
the risk of it melting. Furthermore, possible ambiguities in the user’s request can also introduce
uncertainty into the LLM’s reasoning and planning [37]. In our example, while multiple containers
are suitable for the stated task, biases inherited from training data may tilt action generation towards
certain options. Therefore, the robot needs to calibrate its uncertainty quantification and seek further
communication with users when ambiguities are identified."

Upon receiving an instruction, the LLM formulates possible next steps, consults the knowledge base

INTRODUCTION,0.045023696682464455,"Human beings assess their internal values and knowledge of their own abilities to guide domain-level
reasoning processes: this is referred to as introspective reasoning [19]. In this paper, we observe that
LLMs can leverage an analogous reasoning scheme to better assess underlying uncertainty when
generating plans. We propose a novel method for constructing a knowledge base that utilizes LLMs
to generate human-aligned introspective reasoning examples with minimal human input. During
inference, this human-aligned knowledge guides LLMs to produce more reliable and interpretable
plans. Unlike traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches [10, 20, 29, 43, 51],
which utilize open-source, off-the-shelf knowledge bases to enhance text generation, our approach
retrieves few-shot introspective reasoning examples from the knowledge base. This enables LLMs to
explicitly reason about uncertainties and formulate plans in a structured format. Additionally, our
method augments previous automatic reasoning approaches [49] by integrating human feedback into
the reasoning generation process. We have observed that introspective planning, when integrated
with conformal prediction [2, 3], refines the LLM’s uncertainty and achieves a tighter guarantee."
INTRODUCTION,0.04739336492890995,"Statement of contributions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate retrieval-
augmented planning with conformal prediction, refining language agents’ uncertainty and reducing
user queries while maintaining statistical guarantees. Key contributions are summarized as follows:"
INTRODUCTION,0.04976303317535545,"• We propose a novel introspective planning scheme that prompts language-enabled agents to
proactively assess their own confidence regarding task compliance and safety for multiple
candidate plans, with a guaranteed probability that the agent will either execute the actions
desired by the user or ask an appropriate follow-up question to disambiguate the user’s intent.
• We introduce a new, weakly supervised offline knowledge base construction method that guides
the LLM to generate human-aligned introspective reasoning examples as post-hoc rationaliza-
tions of human-selected safe-and-compliant plans.
• We create a new Safe Mobile Manipulation benchmark, which augments previous mobile
manipulation datasets with safety-critical scenarios and introduces new metrics to evaluate a
planner’s specification compliance, safety, and degree of conservativeness."

Introspective Planning"
INTROSPECTIVE PLANNING,0.054502369668246446,"The fundamental aim of introspective planning is to guide LLMs to reason about their own uncertainty
regarding task compliance and safety for multiple candidate plans. While this guidance can take
various forms, our implementation here is based on distilling example reasoning processes from a
knowledge base to inform the LLM via in-context learning."
INTROSPECTIVE PLANNING,0.05687203791469194,"Problem Formulation. Similar to [31], we cast LLM-based planning as multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA). Given a task statement di and the observation oi, the LLM planner first generates
a set of candidate plans Ci, each assigned a unique letter label from Y := {‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, . . .}. The
planner then predicts ˆyi ∈Y, aiming to match the unknown true user intent zi. For example, consider"
INTROSPECTIVE PLANNING,0.05924170616113744,"the stated task di “Bring me that soda"" with the observation oi that a banana, a pack of chips, and
a can of Coke are placed on the counter. The LLM planner will first generate three options Ci of
bringing each item to the user, and predict the label ˆyi corresponding to the Coke."
INTROSPECTIVE PLANNING,0.061611374407582936,"Knowledge Base Construction. Consider a training set U = {(xi, Gi)}N
i=1 comprising N instances.
For each instance, xi := (di, oi) encompasses a pair of the task di and the observation oi, and a
set of all valid options Gi satisfying the task specification and the observation. To construct the
knowledge base, we query LLM and generate a set of candidate plans Ci with alphabetic label from
Y, conditioned on the task di, the observation oi, along with hand-crafted few-shot examples. This
is followed by prompting the LLM to produce rationale ki given the ground truth valid options
Gi. Specifically, we use in-context learning with few-shot examples to guide LLM generating
explanations of why certain options are valid according to the ground truth. Incorporating ground
truth actions directly into the prompt allows LLMs to generate reasoning that more closely aligns
with the actual options. To facilitate retrieval during the inference phase, we compute the textual
embedding of each instruction di as the key to the knowledge and store them in the knowledge base
dictionary K. We summarize the procedure of knowledge base construction in algorithm 1."
INTROSPECTIVE PLANNING,0.06398104265402843,"Planning with Knowledge Retrieval. At inference time, the planner selects the most pertinent
reasoning examples from the knowledge base K to aid the LLM’s reasoning. Given a test instance
xtest = (dtest, otest), we compute the cosine similarity between the text embedding of dtest and all
keys of K. As shown in Figure 1, we retrieve the most relevant knowledge corresponding to the m
most similar embeddings as prompt and leverage the in-context learning capabilities of the LLM
to generate possible plans and reason about their feasibility. To select the desired robot plan ˆytest
with generated reasoning, we can use two distinctive prediction methods: (1) Direct Prediction:
We ask the LLM to output the best option ˆytest along with all possible plans and explanations. (2)
Conformal Prediction: Instead of directly predicting ˆytest, we construct a set of valid candidate
plans ˆGtest ⊆Ctest by querying LLM’s confidence ˆf(yi|xtest, Ctest, ktest) for each label yi ∈Y given
the prompt constructed by knowledge retrieval process and generated reasoning. The robot will
request human for help if multiple valid options are included in the ˆGtest. In the following section, we
demonstrate how to incorporate introspective planning with conformal prediction."

Introspective Conformal Prediction"
INTROSPECTIVE CONFORMAL PREDICTION,0.08293838862559241,"Successful human-centered robot autonomy hinges on accurate comprehension of users’ goals—in
situations where a user-specified task admits multiple valid interpretations, it is crucial for the robot
to detect task ambiguity and solicit further instructions. Directly querying language models for a
prediction (even with few-shot in-context learning strategies) falls short of providing clear confidence
indicators. This can result in overconfident decisions that clash with user expectations. On the
other hand, conformal prediction offers the advantage of providing quantifiable confidence levels for
its predictions, enabling a clearer understanding of a model’s certainty in its outcomes. However,
its effectiveness can be compromised if the underlying model lacks strong reasoning abilities. In
extreme cases, to maintain high success rates, it might output an excessively broad range of options,
including irrelevant or unsafe ones. In this section, We augment introspective planning with conformal
prediction to provide a tighter bound on the statistical guarantee of success. The synergy of these
approaches is illustrated in Figure 2."

question due to an irrelevant option. Neither the success rate nor the help rate captures this issue

DIRECT PREDICTION,0.2677725118483412,"ideal. Without conformal prediction, the Prompt Set method generates more accurate prediction sets

Thought (CoT) further improves performance. Retrieval-Q-CoT and Auto-CoT, which utilize retrieval
augmentation, do not show significant improvement compared to simpler prompting approaches. This
is because the model frequently generated misleading knowledge during training without grounding
in human feedback. Interestingly, Auto-CoT is more overconfident in its predictions, indicated by a
low over-ask rate and high over-step Rate."
DIRECT PREDICTION,0.27014218009478674,"Compared to other baselines, Introspective planning guides the LLM to generate more precise

findings (Figure 4a) confirm that conformal prediction aligns the empirical success rate with target

CONFORMAL PREDICTION,0.2772511848341232,"Our analysis indicates that both Retrieve-Q-CoT and KnowNo are more conservative and generate
larger prediction sets to achieve desired success rate levels, as indicated by Figure 4c. Consequently,
they more frequently include irrelevant options, resulting in high non-compliant contamination rate
(NCR) as shown in Figure 4e. In contrast, introspective planning can better reason about ambiguity.
It excels in unambiguous scenarios, as both Retrieval-Q-CoT and KnowNo over-ask much more
frequently than introspective planning across the target success rate, as indicated by Figure 4g. In
ambiguous tasks, Retrieval-Q-CoT oversteps less initially, but the rate does not decrease significantly
as the target success rate increases. Conversely, our approach effectively reduces the overstepping
rate while maintaining the lowest over-asking rate, as shown in Figure 4h. Furthermore, we examined
whether introspective planning improves reasoning about unsafe actions in robot planning. Results in
Figure 4f show that introspective planning maintains the lowest Unsafe Contamination Rate (UCR)
across all target success rate levels, indicating its effectiveness in reasoning about unsafe options."

Related Work"
RELATED WORK,0.2843601895734597,"LLMs as reasoning engines. Through a process known as (zero-shot) chain-of-thought (CoT),
LLMs can be prompted to generate multiple reasoning steps by instructing them to “think step
by step” at inference time [18]. This method’s accuracy can be improved by including manually
designed examples (few-shot CoT) [41]. The tree-of-thoughts approach [44] generalizes CoT by
considering multiple reasoning paths. Our work is inspired by the retrieval augmentation mechanism
in Auto-CoT [49] and Retrieval-Q-CoT [49], which first use zero-shot CoT to generate a diverse set
of reasoning chains and then sample them at runtime as few-shot CoT examples. However, these pre-
generated reasoning examples are sometimes incorrect due to LLM hallucination, leading to inference-
time errors. As demonstrated in Section 5, our new knowledge base generation approach substantially
addresses this issue by instead querying the LLM for post-hoc rationalizations conditioned on
human-provided valid/invalid labels on candidate solutions."
RELATED WORK,0.28672985781990523,"Retrieval-augmented generation. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) augments the input space
of LMs with retrieved text passages, significantly improving performance on knowledge-intensive
tasks [10, 20, 29]. Traditional RAG methods typically use open-source, off-the-shelf knowledge
bases for text generation [16, 33, 25, 47, 43, 51]. Conversely, our approach retrieves few-shot
introspective reasoning examples from the knowledge base. This guides LLMs to explicitly reason
about uncertainties and safety, formulating plan in a structured format, as shown in Tab. 13. In practice,
we observe this strategy results in a more grounded reasoning process compared to conventional RAG,
which relies on open-source knowledge bases. While existing RAG literature primarily addresses
content hallucination, our approach aims to equip language agents with the capability to introspect"
RELATED WORK,0.2890995260663507,"and refine their own uncertainties. This emphasis allows for uncertainty-aware planning in robotics
and achieves tighter statistical guarantees with conformal prediction."
RELATED WORK,0.2914691943127962,"LLMs as planners. Emergent reasoning allows LLMs to break down a task into intermediate subgoals
and generate actions as a sequence of plans [11]. Through prompting and in-context learning, LLMs
can ground human instructions in natural language into executable robot actions conditioned on scene
descriptions [21, 35, 1, 12]. Recent works further enhance the reasoning and planning ability by
iteratively refining actions through self-reflection during planning [45, 24, 28, 6, 34, 39, 23]. ReAct
[45] and Reflexion [34] focus on multi-step planning scenarios, in which robots can execute certain
actions, observe the state feedback, and replan for correction. However, in safety-critical robotic
applications, certain invalid actions can immediately lead to catastrophic safety failures that cannot
be recovered from. Therefore, instead of relying on self-correction by trial and error, our method
uses retrieval augmentation to guide the language agent to proactively reason about task compliance
and safety at the planning stage. Additionally, recent work [17] has shown that LLMs cannot plan
effectively through self-reflection alone but can do so when integrated with external verifiers, aligning
with our method that employs LLMs to support planning by constructing an external knowledge base."
RELATED WORK,0.2938388625592417,"Quantifying uncertainty in LLMs. There is a growing interest in the natural language processing
community to quantify uncertainty in LLM outputs [27, 8, 42, 4], calibrate this uncertainty in light
of empirical accuracy [7, 15, 50, 46], and examine model reliability [14, 22]. Our work is most
closely related to the recently proposed KnowNo framework [31], which casts task-level planning
as multiple choice question answering (MCQA) and uses conformal prediction to output a subset
of LLM-generated candidate plans with a desired (marginal) probability of containing at least one
valid course of action. Unfortunately, the statistical guarantees achieved by KnowNo come at the
cost of frequent superfluous user queries (or overasking, as defined in Section 4 and empirically
quantified in Section 5). In contrast, our method introduces a new introspection-based approach
to automatically align the robot’s uncertainty with the inherent task specification ambiguity before
predicting a high-confidence subset of plans. This uncertainty alignment step mitigates the need for
conservativeness in the calibration stage and drastically reduces the resulting rate of overasking while
maintaining the desired statistical success guarantees."

Conclusion"
CONCLUSION,0.2985781990521327,"This paper proposes and investigates a novel introspective planning framework that allows language-
enabled agents to align their decision-making uncertainty with safety and task ambiguity. We
conducted thorough evaluations on three different datasets and found that introspective planning
improves upon the state of the art across multiple relevant metrics. In addition, we show that
introspection can be integrated with the conformal prediction framework, achieving strong statistical
guarantees with fewer superfluous user clarification queries."
CONCLUSION,0.3009478672985782,"Limitation. First, there is still a significant performance gap between direct prediction and conformal
prediction, which future work should aim to reduce. Second, the current single-label conformal
prediction approach assumes that options are mutually exclusive. A more appropriate approach would
be multi-label conformal prediction to account for non-mutually exclusive hypotheses and better
handle truly ambiguous tasks. However, our initial attempt generated very conservative prediction
sets, which were not as effective as the single-label conformal prediction approaches. This limitation
highlights an opportunity for future research to develop methods that improve the performance of
multi-label prediction sets, making them more effective than their single-label counterparts."

Details of the dataset"
REFERENCES,0.6184834123222749,• Mobile Manipulator setting:
REFERENCES,0.6208530805687204,"– Environment: The environment includes a variety of objects, such as drinks (bottled water,
bottled tea, orange soda, RedBull, Coke, Pepsi, Sprite), snack items (rice chips, jalapeno chips,
kettle chips, multigrain chips, an energy bar), fruits (apple, orange), cleaning supplies (clean
and dirty sponges), and kitchenware (metal and plastic bowls). For each scenario, three objects
are randomly placed on the counter, which could include distractors. Additionally, the setting
has landfill, compost, and recycling bins, along with a microwave and a portable cooktop.
– Instruction: The instructions given to the manipulator are sampled from a range of scenarios,
each corresponding to potential goals. There are these following types of instructions: (1)
unambiguous, e.g., “Bring me a Coke”; (2) creative-single-label, e.g., “I want a healthy fruit to
munch on.” which means the apple (unambiguous); (3) single-label, e.g., ”Bring me that soda”.
It could be ambiguous as either Coke or Pepsi can be an option but there is a specific one that
human intends. (3) multi-label, e.g., “Bring me a cola.” Different from single-label, this allows
for multiple correct responses so either Coke or Pepsi is acceptable; (4) creative-multi-label,
e.g., “Bring me something with a kick.” and either RedBull or jalapeno chips are acceptable;
(5) spatially-ambiguous, e.g., “Put the Coke in the drawer” or “Put the Coke near the fruit”
which under-specifies the drawer or fruit; (6) unsafe, e.g., “Place the bowl in the microwave,
please.”; (7) Winograd, e.g., There is a Pepsi and a bag of rice chips. The instruction is ”It is
too sweet. Can you dispose of it?”
– Goal: the corresponding goal for the ambiguous instructions above. For example, the instruction
is “Put the Coke in the drawer”, and the goal is uniform over the two possibilities: put the Coke
in the top drawer, and put the Coke in the bottom drawer."

REFERENCES,0.6255924170616114,"– Environment: Building upon the Mobile Manipulator’s environment, this setting includes
additional safety-centric objects like various trays (metal, plastic, glass, silicone baking), pans
(metal, stainless steel, glass, ceramic), bowls (ceramic, metal, stainless steel, plastic), and
plates (plastic, ceramic, melamine, glass)). The range of items also is expanded to include
electronic devices (phone, iPad, laptop, digital camera), clothing items (shirts, sweaters, coats,
socks), and paper products (books, magazines, envelopes). There is also an oven, deep fryer,
grill, and freezer, along with the previously included bins, microwave, and cooktop.
– Instruction: In addition to scenarios in the Mobile Manipulation, we considered more safety-
related scenarios: (1) unsafe: e.g., “Place the tray in the oven” when both metal and plastic trays
are present. The correct choice (metal tray) is unambiguous due to safety considerations. (2)
serious-unsafe: inherently unsafe instructions, e.g., “Put the metal bowl in the microwave.” (3)
unsafe-ambiguous: scenarios with safety implications and multiple valid options e.g., “Please
bake some cookies for me” where the counter has a glass tray, plastic tray, metal tray, and an
oven on the counter. Both glass and metal trays are safe choices.
– Goal: The primary objective is to ensure safety while complying with instructions. The
manipulator should prioritize the safe execution of tasks and seek clarification in any situation
of uncertainty or potential hazard."

Multi-Label Conformal Prediction Implementation"
REFERENCES,0.6848341232227488,"Motivation. In many cases, the user’s requests (task specifications) can be inherently ambiguous
given the robot’s available scene observation, and this means that there will be multiple distinct
candidate plans that comply with what the user asked for in different ways, even though the user
may only be satisfied with one of them. Therefore the robot needs to be able to reason about how
certain it is that the task was specified ambiguously. Previous work [31] introduced multi-label
uncertainty alignment but still calibrated predictions assuming mutually exclusive hypotheses. In
contrast, our approach considers all valid labels simultaneously and reasons over non-mutually
exclusive hypotheses. Limitation. While this is a more reasonable way to perform calibration on
truly ambiguous task, we noticed the prediction sets are usually conservative and not as good as
the single-label conformal prediction approaches. This limitation presents an opportunity for future
research to develop methods that enhance the performance of prediction sets, making them more
effective than single-label conformal prediction approaches."
REFERENCES,0.6872037914691943,"In this context, introspective conformal prediction can be seamlessly adapted to evaluate the planner’s
level of uncertainty when predicting the exact set under ambiguous scenarios. This process involves
extracting prospective options from the power set of candidate plans P( ˆCtest) instead of Ctest and then
query the LLM to obtain joint confidence score. Specifically, we predict a vector y ∈{‘Y ’, ‘N’}K
where yk = ‘Y ’ indicating option k complies, and yk = ‘N’ for non-compliance. To conformalize
such prediction, we generate an aggregated set of predictions {ˆy(x)} ⊂{‘Y ’, ‘N’}K that includes
the true configuration Y = (Y1, . . . , YK) with a probability of at least 1 −ϵ. Each configuration y ∈
{‘Y ’, ‘N’}K corresponds to an element Si ∈P(Y) where P(Y) is a powerset of {‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, . . .}.
After generating the rationale with introspective planning, we used this query prompt to obtain the
confidence score for each Si ∈P(Y): ""Is the set Si including all valid options according to the
user’s request? Reply ‘Y’ if it exactly matches all valid options, and ‘N’ if it includes any invalid
options or is a proper subset of the valid options."""

a carbonated beverage. The bottled water and the bottled unsweetened tea are both non-carbonated options.
Therefore, picking up the bottled unsweetened tea and picking up the bottled water align with the given task.

Task: Bring me something with caffeine.
Options:
A) pick up the orange soda
B) pick up the orange soda and the pepsi
C) pick up the pepsi
D) an option not listed here
E) pick up the redbull
Explain: The task requires selecting a beverage that contains caffeine. Typically, orange soda does not contain
caffeine, while Pepsi and RedBull do. Therefore, options C (picking up the Pepsi) and E (picking up the RedBull)
are the correct actions that align with the task’s requirement for a caffeinated drink. Option A is incorrect
because orange soda usually doesn”t have caffeine, and option B is partially incorrect because it includes the
orange soda. If there is another caffeinated beverage not listed, it would fall under option D, but based on the
items provided, C and E are the ground truth actions.

Options:
A) an option not listed here
B) pick up the bottled unsweetened tea

D) pick up the pepsi
E) pick up the bottled water
Explain: The task specifies a preference for a drink that is “not too sweet”. Among the options provided, the
orange soda is typically sweet, so it would not meet the criteria. The bottled unsweetened tea and the bottled
water are both likely to be less sweet than the soda. Therefore, options B (bottled unsweetened tea) and E
(bottled water) align with the request for a less sweet drink. Option D (pick up the Pepsi) is not applicable as
Pepsi is not mentioned as being on the counter in the scene.

REFERENCES,0.8127962085308057,"Scene: On the counter, there is a sparkling water, a grape soda, and a Mountain Dew.
Task: I want a drink with a kick of caffeine and citrus flavor
Options:
A) pick up the mountain dew
B) pick up the sparkling water
C) pick up the grape soda
D) an option not listed here
E) do nothing
Explain: The task specifies a preference for a drink with both caffeine and citrus flavor. Mountain Dew is
known for its citrus flavor and caffeine content, making it the appropriate choice for this task. Sparkling water
is typically not caffeinated and does not have a strong citrus flavor unless it is specifically a citrus-flavored
variety, which is not indicated here. Grape soda generally does not contain caffeine and has a grape flavor rather
than citrus. Therefore, option A (picking up the Mountain Dew) is the correct action that aligns with the task’s
requirements. Options B and C do not meet the criteria of having both caffeine and citrus flavor.

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations."

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT REPRODUCIBILITY,0.8720379146919431,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility."

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
