ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.00234192037470726,"Machine learning is faced with many data challenges when applied in practice.
Among them, a notable barrier is that data are distributed and sharing is unreal-
istic for volume and privacy reasons. Federated learning is a recent formalism to
tackle this challenge, so that data owners can develop a common model jointly but
use it separately. In this work, we consider a less addressed scenario where a da-
tum consists of multiple parts, each of which belongs to a separate owner. In this
scenario, joint efforts are required not only in learning but also in inference. We
study federated inference, which allows each data owner to learn its own model
that captures local data characteristics and copes with data heterogeneity. On the
top is a federation of the local data representations, performing global inference
that incorporates all distributed parts collectively. To enhance this local–global
framework, we propose aligning the ambiguous data representations caused by
arbitrary arrangement of neurons in local neural network models, as well as learn-
ing a consensus graph among data owners in the global model to improve perfor-
mance. We demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed framework on four real-life
data sets including power grid systems and trafﬁc networks."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.00702576112412178,"Machine learning models become increasingly data hungry as the promise of deep learning continues
to realize. More and more applications grow in scale thanks to the availability of distributed data
across devices and organizations. Federated learning (McMahan et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019; Li
et al., 2019; Kairouz et al., 2019) emerges as a formalism that allows data owners to collaboratively
train a common model by using one’s own data without sharing. Such a formalism is poised to
resolve the challenges of expensive data communication and the risk of privacy violation, in light of
policies such as the General Data Protection Regulation (Albrecht, 2016)."
INTRODUCTION,0.00936768149882904,"An issue less addressed by federated learning is the inference process. In fact, inference therein is
trivial: once the common model is learned, each data owner retains a copy and applies it on local
data, independently of other owners. However, such a scenario is not the only one how data are
distributed in practice. In this work, we consider the following scenario: a datum has multiple parts,
each of which belongs to a separate owner. Then, the inference must be collectively performed by
all participating owners, since none of them alone possesses the entire information."
INTRODUCTION,0.0117096018735363,"Vertical federated learning studies such a scenario (Hardy et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2019; Chen et al.,
2020). This concept is ﬁguratively named through cutting the data matrix vertically along the feature
axis, rather than the data axis. From the sporadic literature addressing in this scenario, methods gen-
erally introduce model parameters distributed with data parts and optionally global parameters that
reside in a central server. All parameters are learned jointly, causing however a practical drawback—
expensive coordination (even synchronization) is required among data owners and the central server
(if present)."
INTRODUCTION,0.01405152224824356,"Consider a live example—the national electricity grid, over which thousands of phasor measurement
units (PMUs) have been deployed to monitor the grid condition (Smartgrid.gov). PMU measure-
ments, as time series data, are owned by several parties. These data may be used to train machine
learning models that identify grid events (e.g., fault, oscillation, and generator trip). Such an event"

INTRODUCTION,0.01873536299765808,"detection system relies on collective series measurements at the same time window but distributed
across different data owners. To minimize coordination among owners and maximize autonomy, it
is more desirable if each maintains a model of their own and does not participate joint training."
INTRODUCTION,0.02107728337236534,"In this work, we propose a local–global model framework that maintains data owner autonomy while
staying effective in global inference. Therein, each data owner trains a local model with its data part;
the training is independent and incurs no coordination. In the deep learning terminology, the local
models produce data representations for input data. Then, a central server takes these representations
as input and trains a model for global inference."
INTRODUCTION,0.0234192037470726,"We term the scenario where inference is collectively performed by data owners but training incurs
little coordination among them, federated inference, to distinguish federated learning and vertical
federated learning. The local–global framework we propose for this scenario, however, bears two
technical challenges. One is the ambiguity of local data representations, because feature dimensions
can be arbitrarily permuted without changing the local model. Another challenge is how the global
model leverages innate interactions of local data missed by independent local models."
INTRODUCTION,0.02576112412177986,"We resolve the ﬁrst challenge through aligning the feature dimensions across all local represen-
tations. We resolve the second challenge through employing graph neural networks as the global
inference model, where the graph corresponds to the explicit or implicit relational structure of the
data owners. When such a graph is not present, we treat the combinatorial graph structure as a
random variable of the Bernoulli distribution and optimize the distribution parameters as well."
INTRODUCTION,0.02810304449648712,We summarize the contributions of this work as follows.
INTRODUCTION,0.03044496487119438,"1. We formalized federated inference, a less addressed scenario of machine learning with distributed
data, where inference is conducted jointly by data owners without data sharing and coordinated
training (Section 2).
2. We propose an inference framework that consists of autonomous local models and a central model
that digests local data representations and produces a global output (Section 3).
3. We address the ambiguity challenge of this framework through aligning local representations
(Section 4) and address the missing of local model interactions through employing a graph neu-
ral network in the central global model. We further propose to simultaneously learn the graph
structure if not present (Section 5).
4. We study approaches to latent alignment and approaches to graph structure learning and develop
theoretical insights into these approaches (Theorems 1–3). As a byproduct, a more efﬁcient
Bernoulli sampling method icdf is proposed to sample graphs for structure learning.
5. We demonstrate experiments with four real-life data sets including power grids and trafﬁc net-
works and show the effectiveness of the proposed framework (Section 6)."

PROBLEM SETTING"
PROBLEM SETTING,0.0351288056206089,"Federated inference refers to a machine learning scenario where both training and inference are con-
ducted on distributed data collectively by data owners. Each owner enjoys data and model autonomy
but is subject to centralized coordination that produces a global prediction. This scenario stands in
contrast to federated learning, whose inference process is local and separate among owners."
PROBLEM SETTING,0.03747072599531616,"Formally, we use a superscript i to index data owners. Let x be a datum with label y and let xi be
the part of datum the ith owner possesses; that is, x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) with n owners. The problem
is to learn a model
y = f(x) = f(x1, x2, . . . , xn)
(1)
collectively with all data parts and to perform inference jointly by all owners. Additionally, owners
share neither data nor models with each other for, e.g., privacy reasons. Moreover, owners do not
participate joint training, which often incurs expensive coordination."
PROBLEM SETTING,0.03981264637002342,"Similarity to federated learning. Federated inference shares the deﬁning data characteristics of
federated learning, ﬁrst coined in McMahan et al. (2017): distributed, non-IID, and unbalanced.
Data are distributed among owners but not shared. In fact, data may even be heterogeneous. For
example, time series measures of the power grid may have different attribute dimensions and may be
under different sampling frequencies. As a result, data size may vary signiﬁcantly among owners."
PROBLEM SETTING,0.04215456674473068,Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
PROBLEM SETTING,0.04449648711943794,"Dissimilarity to federated learning. The root of the differences between these two concepts is the
constituent of one datum (data point). In federated learning, a data point is the basic unit of data and
thus all owners learn a common model but use it separately. On the other hand, federated inference is
concerned with data split in parts across owners. All parts of a data point contribute to the inference
collectively."
PROBLEM SETTING,0.0468384074941452,"Similarity and dissimilarity to vertical federated learning. Both concepts are concerned with
the split of a datum across owners. However, approaches taken for vertical federated learning differ
substantially from ours because of joint training among owners. From the less proliﬁc literature, two
lines of work are noted. One takes the data matrix literally, by assuming tabular data and studying
linear models, where model parameters have natural correspondence to the data parts (Hardy et al.,
2017; Nock et al., 2018; Heinze et al., 2014; 2016). Often, these approaches are hard to generalize
to complex data and/or many owners. Another line of work uses a local–global model framework
similarly as we do but jointly trains these two parts, incurring expensive communication and creating
dependence of local models (Hu et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020).1 In contrast, we allow data owners
to train their models independently, maintaining local model autonomy."
PROBLEM SETTING,0.04918032786885246,"Figure 1: Federated inference: A global label is
predicted collectively based on local data from
multiple owners.
Local data may be heteroge-
neous and missing data may occur."
PROBLEM SETTING,0.05152224824355972,"Data example. Let us consider the power grid.
Figure 1 pictorially illustrates PMU measure-
ments distributed across data owners. A panel
of time series corresponds to a speciﬁc time
window and the series collectively represent
one data point, which the event detection sys-
tem classiﬁes.
In this simpliﬁed illustration,
each data owner possesses one series recorded
by one PMU; but in practice they may own
different amounts of PMUs (and thus series).
Moreover, the series may differ in length be-
cause of varying sampling frequencies; and the
series are multivariate with possibly different
number of variates. All these variations con-
tribute to data heterogeneity, which necessitates
the construction of separate local models. Note
that if an event does not cascade over the en-
tire grid, some local models may report event
whereas others report normal, resulting in con-
ﬂicting opinions. A consensus (global) model
is responsible to resolve the conﬂict. Addition-
ally, missing data may occur."

FEDERATED INFERENCE FRAMEWORK"
FEDERATED INFERENCE FRAMEWORK,0.05620608899297424,"As such, the proposed framework for federated inference consists of local models f i and a global
model g, such that their composition is the sought f denoted in (1). Each data owner i possesses
a local model trained with its data, independently of other owners. This way, no data sharing is
invoked and privacy is of minimal concern. However, because the local models lack a global vision
and may be conﬂicting, a central (global) model is key to coordinating the local opinions for ﬁnal
prediction. To maintain autonomy, local models are frozen once pretrained and will not join the
training of the global model. Data owners send local data representations to a centralized server
for global model training (and inference). In other words, the global model queries neither the raw
data nor the local models from data owners. As long as owners agree to send the less decipherable
representations to the central server, global inference can be made."
FEDERATED INFERENCE FRAMEWORK,0.0585480093676815,"Local models. We treat a neural network except the ﬁnal output layer as a feature extractor, which
produces the representation hi of an input xi; and treat for simplicity the output layer as a logistic
regression. That is, a local model f i reads:
f i(xi) = softmax(W ihi + bi)
where
hi = embedding(xi).

arbitrarily complex function is applicable."

FEDERATED INFERENCE FRAMEWORK,0.09133489461358314,"Challenges. Two considerations are pertinent to this framework. First, when the latent dimensions
have semantic meaning (e.g., when the local models are trained to yield disentangled representa-
tions (Higgins et al., 2018)), each latent feature of the local representations may not match, because
an arbitrary permutation of the latent dimensions does not change a local model. Second, a naive
mean pooling as in (4) may miss the interdependencies between local data, leading to a less well per-
forming global model. Such interdependencies naturally occur in the power grid example because
of the physics of an electricity network. Hence, in subsequent sections, we use latent alignment to
address the ﬁrst problem and graph neural network to address the second one. Incorporating these
two components, we show the full, proposed framework in Figure 2 and Algorithm 1 (supplement
Section C)."

ALIGNING LOCAL REPRESENTATIONS,0.09601873536299765,"For the global model to be meaningful, the feature dimensions of the local representations hi should
match. For example, in (4), all hi’s multiply the same weight matrix W0; in other words, each
element of hi corresponds to one input neuron of the initial fully connected layer. Permutations
of the elements will destroy the correspondence. That is, even if the local models are ﬁxed, the
arbitrary arrangement of the feature dimensions of the latent vectors causes ambiguity of what an
optimal global model can be built."

correspondence of each feature dimension of the latent vectors while the soft approach does not.
Maintaining the dimension correspondence is an advantage, especially for local models that pro-
duce disentangled latent representations (Higgins et al., 2018), because each feature dimension is
equipped with a semantic meaning that controls a certain aspect of the data. On the other hand, the
soft approach is more straightforward and the hard approach is based on an algorithm that barely
converges. In practice, we observe that neither approach decisively outperforms the other in feder-

parameters to learn. Formally, the elements Aij are independent and each follows Ber(θij), where
θij denotes the corresponding probability (Kipf et al., 2018; Shang et al., 2021). Then, the global
model g has W0, W1, the P i’s, as well as θ, as parameters. Following Franceschi et al. (2019);

Maddison et al., 2017). In what follows, for simplicity of exposition, we treat θ a scalar rather than a

joint training compromises the optimality of local data representations separately obtained by each

cannot be used unless data owners agree to share data."

alignment strategy (including no alignment) to the role of graphs in the global model: not using
a graph, using the given graph, and learning a graph (by using either the Gumbel trick or the icdf
method). The numbers in the table suggest that within each alignment strategy, graph structure
learning signiﬁcantly improves the classiﬁcation. The performance of the Gumbel trick and that of
icdf is highly comparable."

EXPERIMENTS,0.30679156908665106,"Comparison of Gumbel softmax and icdf. Prior results suggest that these two approaches for
differentiably sampling the Bernoulli distribution perform equally well. An advantage of icdf is its
lower computational cost. To demonstrate this advantage, we design a mini-benchmark that high-
lights the sampling and gradient computation and minimizes the effect of irrelevant complications
(such as permutation and GNN). To this end, we generate samples (xi ∈Rn, yi ∈Rn) for some
A ∈{0, 1}n×n, where yi = Axi + noise, and use the samples to learn A through differentiable
parameterization. Figure 5 shows the time and memory consumption at a ﬁxed number of learning
epochs. As a sanity check, the running time scales nicely as O(n2) as expected (while the memory
consumption is complicated; it does not follow O(n2) because of memory management in Python).
Overall, one clearly sees the lower computational cost of the icdf method."

CONCLUSIONS,0.3185011709601874,"In this paper, we study federated inference, a less addressed scenario of machine learning with
distributed data that require collective inference. This scenario is in contrast to federated learning,
where inference is local and requires no joint efforts. We motivate the practicality of federated
inference by using a power grid example and propose a local–global model framework for it. Two
important components of the framework are the alignment of the data representations produced by
local models and the learning of the global model by using a graph neural network. Comprehensive
experiments suggest the feasibility of federated inference and the effectiveness of the framework."

RELATED WORK"
REFERENCES,0.43559718969555034,"The concept of federated learning was ﬁrst coined by McMahan et al. (2017) and it has attracted
surging interests since. A form of distributed optimization, federated learning is faced with data
challenges beyond conventional assumptions and puts communication efﬁciency and data privacy as
primary concerns. Recent surveys (Yang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Kairouz et al., 2019) compre-
hensively study the subject, review systems and infrastructures, and suggest open problems."
REFERENCES,0.4379391100702576,"The typical setting of federated learning is that data sets across owners share the same feature space
but differ in samples. Besides this horizontal partitioning of the data matrix, a vertical partitioning
was studied by Hardy et al. (2017); Nock et al. (2018); Heinze et al. (2014; 2016), wherein features
are split across owners instead. This setting bears resemblance to our federated inference scenario,
but a crucial distinction is that existing methods for vertical federated learning all perform joint
training. In the referenced work, to preserve privacy, encrypted data or randomly projected data
are communicated among data owners as well as a central coordinator. Such an approach incurs
demanding communication for many owners. Recently, Chen et al. (2020) study a different model,
whose parameters are distributed among owners as well as a central server. The part of the model
corresponding to an owner bears resemblance to our local models; but they are not local models
since they are not independently trained by using local data. Another work along a similar direction
is conducted by Hu et al. (2019), but the global model has no parameters; it is merely a sum of the
local outputs followed by activation (e.g., sigmoid for classiﬁcation)."
REFERENCES,0.44028103044496486,"Our framework learns parameter matrices to align local representations. Such alignments similarly
appear in model fusion, where a number of models are fused together into a common model through
aligning model parameters (Yurochkin et al., 2019a). In the context of deep learning, if the neural
networks come from the same model family, their weights can be matched layerwise, even if the
numbers of weights are different (Yurochkin et al., 2019b; Wang et al., 2020). The referenced work
treats the problem as a bipartite graph matching, where the cost matrix is inferred from maximum a
posteriori estimation. Then, the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955) is applied to ﬁnd the matching.
In our work, instead we treat the permutation alignment as a differentiable parameterization with the
help of Sinkhorn–Knopp (Sinkhorn & Knopp, 1967; Mena et al., 2018; Emami & Ranka, 2018), so
that it can be learned end-to-end with other parameters of the global model."
REFERENCES,0.4426229508196721,"Our framework also advocates learning a graph of data owners in the global model. Graph structure
learning appears under various contexts. One ﬁeld of study is probabilistic graphical models and
casual inference, whereby a directed acyclic structure is learned. Gradient-based approaches in this
context include Zheng et al. (2018); Yu et al. (2019); Lachapelle et al. (2020). On the other hand, a
general graph may still be useful without resorting to causality. Recent approaches supporting GNN-
based modeling include Kipf et al. (2018); Franceschi et al. (2019); Wu et al. (2020); Shang et al.
(2021), wherein a graph structure is simultaneously learned together with the GNN parameters.
The Gumbel trick (Jang et al., 2017; Maddison et al., 2017) is frequently used for differentiable
parameterization, but in this paper we study a more economic alternative parameterization, icdf."

FURTHER DETAILS OF SECTION 4 (PARAMETERIZATION OF
PERMUTATION)"
REFERENCES,0.47540983606557374,"The permutation matrix P is a combinatorial object and is unsuitable for gradient-based training.
We relax P by a doubly stochastic matrix, which is nonnegative and whose row sums and column
sums are all 1. A beneﬁt of such a relaxation is that a differentiable computational procedure exists
for doubly stochastic matrices. The procedure, called the Sinkhorn–Knopp algorithm (Sinkhorn
& Knopp, 1967), was recently used by Mena et al. (2018) and Emami & Ranka (2018) in other
contexts. Informally speaking, starting from a nonnegative square matrix K0, repeatedly normalize
its rows and columns by their sums until convergence. The limit is a doubly stochastic matrix."
REFERENCES,0.477751756440281,"In fact, Mena et al. (2018) and Emami & Ranka (2018) do not start from a free K0 but parameterize
it as exp(M/τ), where M is a free parameter matrix and τ > 0 is a hyperparameter. Such a
parameterization follows more closely Sinkhorn’s algorithm (Sinkhorn, 1964) for computing the
optimal transport (Peyr´e & Cuturi, 2019) under an entropic regularization (Wilson, 1969), where τ
is supposed to anneal to zero. However, this parameterization is not imperative and is not the only
option. For simplicity of exposition, we treat K0 as a free parameter."

and column sums of Kj approach 1 at a speed O(σ2j

irreducibility of the Kj’s and thus of the limit K∗. Then, by the Perron–Frobenius Theorem (Horn
& Johnson, 2012), the doubly stochastic matrix K∗has a simple eigenvalue 1, which coincides with
the spectral radius as well as the dominant singular value. Thus, the second singular value, σ2, must
be < 1. The farther away it is from 1, the faster the iteration converges."

permutation matrix P is 1. If K∗is different from P by ϵ in the spectral norm, then according to

DATA SET DESCRIPTION AND PREPROCESSING"
REFERENCES,0.9531615925058547,"METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. These are trafﬁc data sets (MIT licensed) used by Li et al. (2018).
The former was collected from loop detectors in the highway of Los Angles, CA (Jagadish et al.,
2014) and the latter was collected by the California Transportation Agencies Performance Measure
System. Both data sets recorded several months of data at the resolution of ﬁve minutes. The
network graphs are available, which were constructed by imposing a radial basis function on the
pairwise distance of sensors at a certain cutoff."
REFERENCES,0.955503512880562,"The data sets were originally prepared for forecasting tasks and hence no labeling information exists.
We adapt the data for classiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, we split the time series on the hour, forming hourly
windows. We label each window as whether or not it corresponds to rush hour. For proof of concept,
we specify 07:00–10:00 and 16:00–19:00 as rush hour and the others non-rush hour. We note that
in the original data sets, one of the attributes is time. We remove this attribute to avoid triviality and
retain only the speed attribute."
REFERENCES,0.9578454332552693,"The speciﬁcation of rush hours may not be highly accurate, but it is a sensible practice to cope with
the nonexistence of labeling information. Intuitively, the signal of rush hour comes from reduced
trafﬁc speed, but not every location of the network experiences trafﬁc jam. Hence, the diverse trafﬁc
patterns inside the same time window under a single label causes nontrivial challenges for local
models to discern. Therefore, the need of a global consensus model is justiﬁed and it ﬁts well the
federated inference scenario."

indicate the interconnects of the grid. The data sets come with thousands of annotated grid events
spanning a period of two years; they form the classiﬁcation labels. Many variables (attributes) of
the grid condition are recorded; we select only the voltage magnitude and the current magnitude,
because they appear to be the strongest signals for event detection based on domain knowledge, and
also because more data are available for these two variables. The grid topology is not available."
REFERENCES,0.9625292740046838,"For each event, we select a one-second window from the three-minute window that covers the ap-
proximate annotated event time, based on the largest z-score. We retain a sampling frequency of
30Hz, even though some data are 60Hz. Furthermore, a large amount of data are missing in the
raw data. We impute the series by using pandas.DataFrame.interpolate(method =

a windowed series is complete if it ever has raw data. Even so, many series are entirely empty, which
