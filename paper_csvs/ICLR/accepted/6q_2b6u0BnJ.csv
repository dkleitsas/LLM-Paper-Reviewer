ABSTRACT,0.002304147465437788,"The aim in imitation learning is to learn effective policies by utilizing near-optimal
expert demonstrations. However, high-quality demonstrations from human ex-
perts can be expensive to obtain in large number. On the other hand, it is often
much easier to obtain large quantities of suboptimal or task-agnostic trajectories,
which are not useful for direct imitation, but can nevertheless provide insight
into the dynamical structure of the environment, showing what could be done
in the environment even if not what should be done. We ask the question, is
it possible to utilize such suboptimal ofﬂine datasets to facilitate provably im-
proved downstream imitation learning? In this work, we answer this question
afﬁrmatively and present training objectives that use ofﬂine datasets to learn a
factored transition model whose structure enables the extraction of a latent ac-
tion space. Our theoretical analysis shows that the learned latent action space
can boost the sample-efﬁciency of downstream imitation learning, effectively re-
ducing the need for large near-optimal expert datasets through the use of aux-
iliary non-expert data. To learn the latent action space in practice, we propose
TRAIL (Transition-Reparametrized Actions for Imitation Learning), an algorithm
that learns an energy-based transition model contrastively, and uses the transition
model to reparametrize the action space for sample-efﬁcient imitation learning.
We evaluate the practicality of our objective through experiments on a set of nav-
igation and locomotion tasks. Our results verify the beneﬁts suggested by our
theory and show that TRAIL is able to improve baseline imitation learning by up
to 4x in performance."

INTRODUCTION
Imitation learning uses expert demonstration data to learn sequential decision making poli-
cies (Schaal, 1999). Such demonstrations, often produced by human experts, can be costly to obtain
in large number. On the other hand, practical application domains, such as recommendation (Afsar
et al., 2021) and dialogue (Jiang et al., 2021) systems, provide large quantities of ofﬂine data gen-
erated by suboptimal agents. Since the ofﬂine data is suboptimal in performance, using it directly
for imitation learning is infeasible. While some prior works have proposed using suboptimal ofﬂine
data for ofﬂine reinforcement learning (RL) (Kumar et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019; Levine et al.,
2020), this would require reward information, which may be unavailable or infeasible to compute
from suboptimal data (Abbeel & Ng, 2004). Nevertheless, conceptually, suboptimal ofﬂine datasets
should contain useful information about the environment, if only we could distill that information
into a useful form that can aid downstream imitation learning.
One approach to leveraging suboptimal ofﬂine datasets is to use the ofﬂine data to extract a lower-
dimensional latent action space, and then perform imitation learning on an expert dataset using
this latent action space. If the latent action space is learned properly, one may hope that perform-
ing imitation learning in the latent space can reduce the need for large quantities of expert data.
While a number of prior works have studied similar approaches in the context of hierarchical im-
itation and RL setting (Parr & Russell, 1998; Dietterich et al., 1998; Sutton et al., 1999; Kulkarni
et al., 2016; Vezhnevets et al., 2017; Nachum et al., 2018a; Ajay et al., 2020; Pertsch et al., 2020;
Hakhamaneshi et al., 2021), such methods typically focus on the theoretical and practical beneﬁts
of temporal abstraction by extracting temporally extended skills from data or experience. That is,
the main beneﬁt of these approaches is that the latent action space operates at a lower temporal
frequency than the original environment action space. We instead focus directly on the question of
action representation: instead of learning skills that provide for temporal abstraction, we aim to di-
rectly reparameterize the action space in a way that provides for more sample-efﬁcient downstream"

imitation without the need to reduce control frequency. Unlike learning temporal abstractions, ac-
tion reparamtrization does not have to rely on any hierarchical structures in the ofﬂine data, and can
therefore utilize highly suboptimal datasets (e.g., with random actions).
Aiming for a provably-efﬁcient approach to utilizing highly suboptimal ofﬂine datasets, we use ﬁrst
principles to derive an upper bound on the quality of an imitation learned policy involving three
terms corresponding to (1) action representation and (2) action decoder learning on a suboptimal
ofﬂine dataset, and ﬁnally, (3) behavioral cloning (i.e., max-likelihood learning of latent actions)
on an expert demonstration dataset. The ﬁrst term in our bound immediately suggests a practical
ofﬂine training objective based on a transition dynamics loss using an factored transition model. We
show that under speciﬁc factorizations (e.g., low-dimensional or linear), one can guarantee improved
sample efﬁciency on the expert dataset. Crucially, our mathematical results avoid the potential
shortcomings of temporal skill extraction, as our bound is guaranteed to hold even when there is no
temporal abstraction in the latent action space.
We translate these mathematical results into an algorithm that we call Transition-Reparametrized
Actions for Imitation Learning (TRAIL). As shown in Figure 1, TRAIL consists of a pretraining
stage (corresponding to the ﬁrst two terms in our bound) and a downstream imitation learning stage
(corresponding to the last term in our bound). During the pretraining stage, TRAIL uses an ofﬂine
dataset to learn a factored transition model and a paired action decoder. During the downstream
imitation learning stage, TRAIL ﬁrst reparametrizes expert actions into the latent action space ac-
cording to the learned transition model, and then learns a latent policy via behavioral cloning in the
latent action space. During inference, TRAIL uses the imitation learned latent policy and action
decoder in conjunction to act in the environment. In practice, TRAIL parametrizes the transition
model as an energy-based model (EBM) for ﬂexibility and trains the EBM with a contrastive loss.
The EBM enables the low-dimensional factored transition model referenced by our theory, and we
also show that one can recover the linear transition model in our theory by approximating the EBM
with random Fourier features (Rahimi et al., 2007).
To summarize, our contributions include (i) a provably beneﬁcial objective for learning action rep-
resentations without temporal abstraction and (ii) a practical algorithm for optimizing the proposed
objective by learning an EBM or linear transition model. An extensive evaluation on a set of nav-
igation and locomotion tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed objective. TRAIL’s
empirical success compared to a variety of existing methods suggests that the beneﬁt of learning
single-step action representations has been overlooked by previous temporal skill extraction meth-
ods. Additionally, TRAIL signiﬁcantly improves behavioral cloning even when the ofﬂine dataset is
unimodal or highly suboptimal (e.g., obtained from a random policy), whereas temporal skill extrac-
tion methods lead to degraded performance in these scenarios. Lastly, we show that TRAIL, without
using reward labels, can perform similarly or better than ofﬂine reinforcement learning (RL) with
orders of magnitude less expert data, suggesting new ways for ofﬂine learning of squential decision
making policies."

RELATED WORK
Learning action abstractions is a long standing topic in the hierarchical RL literature (Parr & Russell,
1998; Dietterich et al., 1998; Sutton et al., 1999; Kulkarni et al., 2016; Nachum et al., 2018a). A
large body of work focusing on online skill discovery have been proposed as a means to improve
exploration and sample complexity in online RL. For instance, Eysenbach et al. (2018); Sharma
et al. (2019); Gregor et al. (2016); Warde-Farley et al. (2018); Liu et al. (2021) propose to learn a
diverse set of skills by maximizing an information theoretic objective. Online skill discovery is also
commonly seen in a hierarchical framework that learns a continuous space (Vezhnevets et al., 2017;
Hausman et al., 2018; Nachum et al., 2018a; 2019) or a discrete set of lower-level policies (Bacon"

RELATED WORK,0.03225806451612903,"et al., 2017; Stolle & Precup, 2002; Peng et al., 2019), upon which higher-level policies are trained to
solve speciﬁc tasks. Different from these works, we focus on learning action representations ofﬂine
from a ﬁxed suboptimal dataset to accelerate imitation learning.
Aside from online skill discovery, ofﬂine skill extraction focuses on learning temporally extended
action abstractions from a ﬁxed ofﬂine dataset. Methods for ofﬂine skill extraction generally in-
volve maximum likelihood training of some latent variable models on the ofﬂine data, followed by
downstream planning (Lynch et al., 2020), imitation learning (Kipf et al., 2019; Ajay et al., 2020;
Hakhamaneshi et al., 2021), ofﬂine RL (Ajay et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), or online RL (Fox
et al., 2017; Krishnan et al., 2017; Shankar & Gupta, 2020; Shankar et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2020;
Pertsch et al., 2020; 2021; Wang et al., 2021) in the induced latent action space. Among these
works, those that provide a theoretical analysis attribute the beneﬁt of skill extraction predominantly
to increased temporal abstraction as opposed to the learned action space being any “easier” to learn
from than the raw action space (Ajay et al., 2020; Nachum et al., 2018b). Unlike these methods, our
analysis focuses on the advantage of a lower-dimensional reparametrized action space agnostic to
temporal abstraction. Our method also applies to ofﬂine data that is highly suboptimal (e.g., contains
random actions) and potentially unimodal (e.g., without diverse skills to be extracted), which have
been considered challenging by previous work (Ajay et al., 2020).
While we focus on reducing the complexity of the action space through the lens of action representa-
tion learning, there exists a disjoint set of work that focuses on accelerating RL with state represen-
tation learning (Singh et al., 1995; Ren & Krogh, 2002; Castro & Precup, 2010; Gelada et al., 2019;
Zhang et al., 2020; Arora et al., 2020; Nachum & Yang, 2021), some of which have proposed to
extract a latent state space from a learned dynamics model. Analogous to our own derivations, these
works attribute the beneﬁt of representation learning to a smaller latent state space reduced from a
high-dimensional input state space (e.g., images). Lastly, there exist model-based approaches that
utilizes ofﬂine data to learn model dynamics which in tern accelerates imitation (Chang et al., 2021;
Rafailov et al., 2021). These work differ from our focus of using the ofﬂine data to learn latent
action space."

to imitation learning is to learn a policy π that minimizes some discrepancy between π and π∗. In

PERFORMANCE BOUND WITH REPARAMETRIZED ACTIONS
Despite Doﬀbeing highly suboptimal (e.g., with random actions), the large set of (s, a, s′) tuples
from Doﬀreveals the transition dynamics of the environment, which a latent action space should
support. Under this motivation, we propose to learn a factored transition model T := TZ ◦φ
from the ofﬂine dataset Doﬀ, where φ : S × A →Z is an action representaiton function and
TZ : S × Z →∆(S) is a latent transition model. Intuitively, good action representations should
enable good imitation learning.
We formalize this intuition in the theorem below by establishing a bound on the quality of a learned
policy based on (1) an ofﬂine pretraining objective for learning φ and TZ, (2) an ofﬂine decoding
objective for learning an action decoder πα, and (3) a downstream imitation learning objective for
learning a latent policy πZ with respect to latent actions determined by φ.
Theorem 1. Consider an action representation function φ : S × A →Z, a factored transition
model TZ : S × Z →∆(S), an action decoder πα : S × Z →∆(A), and a tabular latent policy
πZ : S →∆(Z). Deﬁne the transition representation error as
JT(TZ, φ) := E(s,a)∼doff [DKL(T (s, a)∥TZ(s, φ(s, a)))] ,
the action decoding error as
JDE(πα, φ) := E(s,a)∼doff[−log πα(a|s, φ(s, a))],
and the latent behavioral cloning error as
JBC,φ(πZ) := E(s,a)∼(dπ∗,π∗)[−log πZ(φ(s, a)|s)].

LINEAR TRANSITION MODELS WITH DETERMINISTIC LATENT POLICY
Theorem 1 has introduced the notion of a latent expert policy π∗,Z, and minimizes the KL divergence
between π∗,Z and a tabular latent policy πZ. However, it is not immediately clear, in the case of
continuous latent actions, how to ensure that the latent policy πZ is expressive enough to capture any
π∗,Z. In this section, we provide guarantees for recovering stochastic expert policies with continuous
latent action space under a linear transition model.
Consider a continuous latent space Z ⊂Rd and a deterministic latent policy πθ(s) = θs for some
θ ∈Rd×|S|. While a deterministic θ in general cannot capture a stochastic π∗, we show that under
a linear transition model TZ(s′|s, φ(s, a)) = w(s′)⊤φ(s, a), there always exists a deterministic
policy πθ : S →Rd, such that θs = π∗,Z(s), ∀s ∈S. This means that our scheme for ofﬂine
pretraining paired with downstream imitation learning can provably recover any expert policy π∗
from a deterministic πθ, regardless of whether π∗is stochastic."

TRAIL: REPARAMETRIZED ACTIONS AND IMITATION LEARNING IN PRACTICE"
LINEAR TRANSITION MODELS WITH DETERMINISTIC LATENT POLICY,0.1359447004608295,"In this section, we describe our learning framework, Transition-Reparametrized Actions for Im-
itation Learning (TRAIL). TRAIL consists of two training stages: pretraining and downstream
behavioral cloning.
During pretraining, TRAIL learns TZ and φ by minimizing JT(TZ, φ) =
E(s,a)∼doff [DKL(T (s, a)∥TZ(s, φ(s, a)))]. Also during pretraining, TRAIL learns πα and φ by
minimizing JDE(πα, φ) := E(s,a)∼doff[−log πα(a|s, φ(s, a))]. TRAIL parametrizes πα as a mul-
tivariate Gaussian distribution. Depending on whether TZ is deﬁned according to Theorem 1 or
Theorem 3, we have either TRAIL EBM or TRAIL linear.
TRAIL EBM for Theorem 1. In the tabular action setting that corresponds to Theorem 1, to
ensure that the factored transition model TZ is ﬂexible to capture any complex (e.g., multi-modal)
transitions in the ofﬂine dataset, we propose to use an energy-based model (EBM) to parametrize
TZ(s′|s, φ(s, a)),
TZ(s′|s, φ(s, a)) ∝ρ(s′)exp(−∥φ(s, a) −ψ(s′)∥2),

we set ρ to be the distribution of s′ in doﬀ, which enables a practical learning objective for TZ by

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
We now evaluate TRAIL on a set of navigation and locomotion tasks (Figure 2). Our evaluation
is designed to study how well TRAIL can improve imitation learning with limited expert data by
leveraging available suboptimal ofﬂine data. We evaluate the improvement attained by TRAIL over
vanilla BC, and additionally compare TRAIL to previously proposed temporal skill extraction meth-
ods. Since there is no existing benchmark for imitation learning with suboptimal ofﬂine data, we
adapt existing datasets for ofﬂine RL, which contain suboptimal data, and augment them with a
small amount of expert data for downstream imitation learning."

EVALUATING NAVIGATION WITHOUT TEMPORAL ABSTRACTION
Description and Baselines.
We start our evaluation on the AntMaze task from D4RL (Fu et al.,
2020), which has been used as a testbed by recent works on temporal skill extraction for few-shot
imitation (Ajay et al., 2020) and RL (Ajay et al., 2020; Pertsch et al., 2020; 2021). We compare
TRAIL to OPAL (Ajay et al., 2020), SkilD (Pertsch et al., 2021), and SPiRL (Pertsch et al., 2020),
all of which use an ofﬂine dataset to extract temporally extended (length t = 10) skills to form
a latent action space for downstream learning. SkiLD and SPiRL are originally designed only for
downstream RL, so we modify them to support downstream imitation learning as described in Ap-
pendix C. While a number of other works have also proposed to learn primitives for hierarchical
imitation (Kipf et al., 2019; Hakhamaneshi et al., 2021) and RL (Fox et al., 2017; Krishnan et al.,
2017; Shankar et al., 2019; Shankar & Gupta, 2020; Singh et al., 2020), we chose OPAL, SkiLD,
and SPiRL for comparison because they are the most recent works in this area with reported results
that suggest these methods are state-of-the-art, especially in learning from suboptimal ofﬂine data
based on D4RL. To construct the suboptimal and expert datasets, we follow the protocol in Ajay
et al. (2020), which uses the full diverse or play D4RL AntMaze datasets as the suboptimal
ofﬂine data, while using a set of n = 10 expert trajectories (navigating from one corner of the
maze to the opposite corner) as the expert data. The diverse and play datasets are suboptimal
in the corner-to-corner navigation task, as they only contain data that navigates to random or ﬁxed
locations different from task evaluation."
EVALUATING NAVIGATION WITHOUT TEMPORAL ABSTRACTION,0.1774193548387097,"Implementation Details.
For TRAIL, we parameterize φ(s, a) and ψ(s′) using separate feed-
forward neural networks (see details in Appendix C) and train the transition EBM via the contrastive
objective described in Section 4.3. We parametrize both the action decoder πα and the latent πZ
using multivariate Gaussian distributions with neural-network approximated mean and variance.
For the temporal skill extraction methods, we implement the trajectory encoder using a bidirectional
RNN and parametrize skill prior, latent policy, and action decoder as Gaussians following Ajay
et al. (2020). We adapt SPiRL and SkiLD for imitation learning by including the KL Divergence
term between the latent policy and the skill prior during downstream behavioral cloning (see details
in Appendix C). We do a search on the extend of temporal abstraction, and found t = 10 to work the
best as reported in these papers’ maze experiments. We also experimented with a version of vanilla
BC pretrained on the suboptimal data and ﬁne-tuned on expert data for fair comparison, which did
not show a signiﬁcant difference from directly training vanilla BC on expert data."

performs similarly to the set of temporal skill extraction methods with t = 10. However, these skill
extraction methods experience a degradation in performance when temporal abstraction is removed
(t = 1). This corroborates the existing theory in these works (Ajay et al., 2020), which attributes
their beneﬁts predominantly to temporal abstraction rather than producing a latent action space that
is “easier” to learn. Meanwhile, TRAIL is able to excel without any temporal abstraction.
These differences become even more pronounced on the harder antmaze-large tasks. We see
that TRAIL maintains signiﬁcant improvements over vanilla BC, whereas temporal skill extraction
fails to achieve good performance even with t = 10. These results suggest that TRAIL attains
signiﬁcant improvement speciﬁcally from utilizing the suboptimal data for learning suitable action
representations, rather than simply from providing temporal abstraction. Of course, this does not
mean that temporal abstraction is never helpful. Rather, our results serve as evidence that suboptimal
data can be useful for imitation learning not just by providing temporally extended skills, but by
actually reformulating the action space to make imitation learning easier and more efﬁcient."

EVALUATING LOCOMOTION WITH HIGHLY SUBOPTIMAL OFFLINE DATA,0.20046082949308755,"Description.
The performance of TRAIL trained on a single-step transition model in the previous
section suggests that learning single-step latent action representations can beneﬁt a broader set of
tasks for which temporal abstraction may not be helpful, e.g., when the ofﬂine data is highly sub-
optimal (with near-random actions) or unimodal (collected by a single stationary policy). In this
section, we consider a Gym-MuJoCo task from D4RL using the same 8-DoF quadruped ant robot
as the previously evaluated navigation task. We ﬁrst learn action representations from the medium,
medium-replay, or random datasets, and imitate from 1% or 2.5% of the expert datasets
from D4RL. The medium dataset represents data collected from a mediocre stationary policy (ex-
hibiting unimodal behavior), and the random dataset is collected by a randomly initialized policy
and is hence highly suboptimal."

For this task, we additionally train a linear version of TRAIL by approx-
imating the transition EBM using random Fourier features (Rahimi et al., 2007) and learn a determin-
istic latent policy following Theorem 3. Speciﬁcally, we use separate feed-forward networks to pa-
rameterize f(s, a) and g(s′), and extract action representations using φ(s, a) = cos(Wf(s, a) + b),
where W, b are untrainable randomly initialized variables as described in Section 4.3. Different from
TRAIL EBM which parametrizes πZ as a Gaussian, TRAIL linear parametrizes the deterministic πθ
using a feed-forward neural network."

Our results are shown in Figure 4. Both the EBM and linear versions of TRAIL con-
sistently improve over baseline BC, whereas temporal skill extraction methods generally lead to
worse performance regardless of the extent of abstraction, likely due to the degenerate effect (i.e.,
latent skills being ignored by a ﬂexible action decoder) resulted from unimodal ofﬂine datasets as
discussed in (Ajay et al., 2020). Surprisingly, TRAIL achieves a signiﬁcant performance boost even
when latent actions are learned from the random dataset, suggesting the beneﬁt of learning action
representations from transition models when the ofﬂine data is highly suboptimal. Additionally, the
linear variant of TRAIL performs slightly better than the EBM variant when the expert sample size
is small (i.e., 10k), suggesting the beneﬁt of learning deterministic latent policies from Theorem 3
when the environment is effectively approximated by a linear transition model."

Having witnessed the improvement TRAIL brings to behavioral cloning on AntMaze
and MuJoCo Ant, we wonder how TRAIL perform on a wider spectrum of locomotion tasks
with various degrees of freedom. We consider 6 locomotion tasks from the DeepMind Control
Suite (Tassa et al., 2018) ranging from simple (e.g., 1-DoF cartople-swingup) to complex
(e.g., 21-DoF humanoid-run) tasks. Following the setup in Zolna et al. (2020), we take
1
10 of
the trajectories whose episodic reward is among the top 20% of the open source RL Unplugged
datasets (Gulcehre et al., 2020) as expert demonstrations (see numbers of expert trajectories in Ap-
pendix C), and the bottom 80% of RL Unplugged as the suboptimal ofﬂine data. For completeness,
we additionally include comparison to Critic Regularized Regression (CRR) (Wang et al., 2020),
an ofﬂine RL method with competitive performance on these tasks. CRR is trained on the full RL
Unplugged datasets (i.e., combined suboptimal and expert datasets) with reward labels."
EVALUATION ON DEEPMIND CONTROL SUITE,0.22119815668202766,"Results.
Figure 5 shows the comparison results. TRAIL outperforms temporal extraction methods
on both low-dimensional (e.g., cartpole-swingup) and high-dimensional (humanoid-run)
tasks. Additionally, TRAIL performs similarly to or better than CRR on 4 out of the 6 tasks despite
not using any reward labels, and only slightly worse on humanoid-run and walker-walk. To
test the robustness of TRAIL when the ofﬂine data is highly suboptimal, we further reduce the size
and quality of the ofﬂine data to the bottom 5% of the original RL Unplugged datasets. As shown
in Figure 6 in Appndix D, the performance of temporal skill extraction declines in fish-swim,
walker-stand, and walker-walk due to this change in ofﬂine data quality, whereas TRAIL
maintains the same performance as when the bottom 80% data was used, suggesting that TRAIL is
more robust to low-quality ofﬂine data.
This set of results suggests a promising direction for ofﬂine learning of sequential decision making
policies, namely to learn latent actions from abundant low-quality data and behavioral cloning in the
latent action space on scarce high-quality data. Notably, compared to ofﬂine RL, this approach is
applicable to settings where data quality cannot be easily expressed through a scalar reward."

CONCLUSION"
CONCLUSION,0.22580645161290322,"We have derived a near-optimal objective for learning a latent action space from suboptimal ofﬂine
data that provably accelerates downstream imitation learning. To learn this objective in practice, we
propose transition-reparametrized actions for imitation learning (TRAIL), a two-stage framework
that ﬁrst pretrains a factored transition model from ofﬂine data, and then uses the transition model to
reparametrize the action space prior to behavioral cloning. Our empirical results suggest that TRAIL
can improve imitation learning drastically, even when pretrained on highly suboptimal data (e.g.,
data from a random policy), providing a new approach to imitation learning through a combination
of pretraining on task-agnostic or suboptimal data and behavioral cloning on limited expert datasets.
That said, our approach to action representation learning is not necessarily speciﬁc to imitation
learning, and insofar as the reparameterized action space simpliﬁes downstream control problems,
it could also be combined with reinforcement learning in future work. More broadly, studying how
learned action reparameterization can accelerate various facets of learning-based control represents
an exciting future direction, and we hope that our results provide initial evidence of such a potential."

EXPERIMENT DETAILS

ARCHITECTURE
We parametrize φ as a two-hidden layer fully connected neural network with 256 units per layer. A
Swish (Ramachandran et al., 2017) activation function is applied to the output of each hidden layer.
We use embedding size 64 for AntMaze and 256 for Ant and all DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)
tasks after sweeping values of 64, 256, and 512, though we found TRAIL to be relatively robust to
the latent dimension size as long as it is not too small (i.e., ≥64). The latent skills in temporal skill
extraction require a much smaller dimension size, e.g., 8 or 10 as reported by Ajay et al. (2020);
Pertsch et al. (2021). We tried increasing the latent skill size for these work during evaluation, but
found the reported value 8 to work the best. We additionally experimented with different extend of
skill extraction, but found the previously reported t = 10 to also work the best. We implement the
trajectory encoder in OPAL, SkiLD, and SPiRL using a bidirectional LSTM with hidden dimension
256. We use β = 0.1 for the KL regularization term in the β VAE of OPAL (as reported). We also
use 0.1 as the weight for SPiRL and SkiLD’s KL divergence terms."

TRAINING AND EVALUATION
During pretraining, we use the Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.0003 for 200k iterations with
batch size 256 for all methods that require pretraining. During downstream behavioral cloning,
learned action representations are ﬁxed, but the action decoder is ﬁne-tuned on the expert data as
suggested by Ajay et al. (2020). Behavioral cloning for all methods including vanilla BC is trained
with learning rate 0.0001 for 1M iterations. We experimented with learning rate decay of down-
stream BC by a factor of 3 at the 200k boundary for all methods. We found that when the expert
sample size is small, decaying learning rate can prevent overﬁtting for all methods. The reported
results are with learning rate decay on AntMaze and without learning rate decay on other envi-
ronments for all methods. During the downstream behavioral cloning stage, we evaluate the latent
policy combined with the action decoder every 10k steps by executing πα ◦πZ in the environment
for 10 episodes and compute the average total return. Each method is run with 4 seeds where each
seed corresponds to one set of action representations and downstream imitation learning result on
that set of representations. We report the mean and standard error for all methods in the bar and line
ﬁgures."

MODIFICATION TO SKILD AND SPIRL
Since SkiLD (Pertsch et al., 2021) and SPiRL (Pertsch et al., 2020) are originally designed for RL
as opposed to imitation learning, we replace the downstream RL algorithms of SkiLD and SPiRL by
behavioral cloning with regularization (but keep skill extraction the same as the original methods).
Speciﬁcally, for SkILD, we apply a KL regularization term between the latent policy and the learned"

between the latent policy and a learn “skill posterior” on the expert data as done in the original paper
during downstream behavioral cloning. We do not need to train the binary classiﬁer that SkiLD
trains to decide which regularizer to apply because we know which set of actions are expert versus
suboptimal in the imitation learning setting. For SPiRL, we apply the KL divergence between latent
policy and skill prior extracted from ofﬂine data (i.e., using the red term in Algorithm 1 of Pertsch
et al. (2020)) as an additional term to latent behavioral cloning."

For the expert data in AntMaze, we use the goal-reaching expert policies trained
by Ajay et al. (2020) (expert means that the agent is trained to navigate from the one corner of the
maze to the opposite corner) to collect n = 10 trajectories. For the suboptimal data in AntMaze, we
