ABSTRACT,0.002145922746781116,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a scalable way to learn general visual represen-
tations since it learns without labels. However, large-scale unlabeled datasets in
the wild often have long-tailed label distributions, where we know little about
the behavior of SSL. In this work, we systematically investigate self-supervised
learning under dataset imbalance. First, we find out via extensive experiments
that off-the-shelf self-supervised representations are already more robust to class
imbalance than supervised representations. The performance gap between bal-
anced and imbalanced pre-training with SSL is significantly smaller than the gap
with supervised learning, across sample sizes, for both in-domain and, especially,
out-of-domain evaluation. Second, towards understanding the robustness of SSL,
we hypothesize that SSL learns richer features from frequent data: it may learn
label-irrelevant-but-transferable features that help classify the rare classes and
downstream tasks. In contrast, supervised learning has no incentive to learn fea-
tures irrelevant to the labels from frequent examples. We validate this hypothesis
with semi-synthetic experiments and theoretical analyses on a simplified setting.
Third, inspired by the theoretical insights, we devise a re-weighted regularization
technique that consistently improves the SSL representation quality on imbalanced
datasets with several evaluation criteria, closing the small gap between balanced
and imbalanced datasets with the same number of examples."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.006437768240343348,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an important paradigm of machine learning, because it can lever-
age the availability of large-scale unlabeled datasets to learn representations for a wide range of
downstream tasks and datasets (He et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Grill et al., 2020; Caron et al.,
2020; Chen & He, 2021). Current SSL algorithms are mostly trained on curated, balanced datasets,
but large-scale unlabeled datasets in the wild are inevitably imbalanced with a long-tailed label
distribution (Reed, 2001; Liu et al., 2019). Curating a class-balanced unlabeled dataset requires the
knowledge of labels, which defeats the purpose of leveraging unlabeled data by SSL."
INTRODUCTION,0.008583690987124463,"The behavior of SSL algorithms under dataset imbalance remains largely underexplored in the
literature, but extensive studies do not bode well for supervised learning (SL) with imbalanced
datasets. The performance of vanilla supervised methods degrades significantly on class-imbalanced
datasets (Cui et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2019; Buda et al., 2018), posing challenges to practical
applications such as instance segmentation (Tang et al., 2020) and depth estimation (Yang et al.,
2021). Many recent works address this issue with various regularization and re-weighting/re-sampling
techniques (Ando & Huang, 2017; Wang et al., 2017b; Jamal et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2019; Cao et al.,

between the performance of the representations pre-trained on balanced and imbalanced datasets of
the same sizes. We observe that the balance-imbalance gap for SSL is much smaller than SL, under a
variety of configurations with varying dataset sizes and imbalance ratios and with both ID and OOD
evaluations (see Figure 1 and Section 2 for more details). This robustness holds even with the same
number of samples for SL and SSL, although SSL does not require labels and hence can be more
easily applied to larger datasets than SL."
INTRODUCTION,0.019313304721030045,"Why is SSL more robust to dataset imbalance? We identify the following underlying cause to
answer this fundamental question: SSL learns richer features from the frequent classes than SL does.
These features may help classify the rare classes under ID evaluation and are transferable to the
downstream tasks under OOD evaluation. For simplicity, consider the situation where rare classes
have so limited data that both SL and SSL models overfit to the rare data. In this case, it is important
for the models to learn diverse features from the frequent classes which can help classify the rare
classes. Supervised learning is only incentivized to learn those features relevant to predicting frequent
classes and may ignore other features. In contrast, SSL may learn the structures within the frequent
classes better—because it is not supervised or incentivized by any labels, it can learn not only the
label-relevant features but also other interesting features capturing the intrinsic properties of the input
distribution, which may generalize/transfer better to rare classes and downstream tasks."
INTRODUCTION,0.02145922746781116,"We empirically validate this intuition by visualizing the features on a semi-synthetic dataset where
the label-relevant features and label-irrelevant-but-transferable features are prominently seen by
design (cf. Section 3.2). In addition, we construct a toy example where we can rigorously prove the
difference between self-supervised and supervised features in Section 3.1."
INTRODUCTION,0.023605150214592276,"Finally, given our theoretical insights, we take a step towards further improving SSL algorithms, clos-
ing the small gap between SSL on balanced and imbalanced datasets. We identify the generalization
gap between the empirical and population pre-training losses on rare data as the key to improvements."
INTRODUCTION,0.02575107296137339,"To this end, we design a simple algorithm that first roughly estimates the density of examples with
kernel density estimation and then applies a larger sharpness-based regularization (Foret et al., 2020)

several evaluation protocols."

mainly learns the features that help classify the frequent classes and may neglect other features which

that supervised learning learns only the e1 direction (which helps classify class 1 vs. class 2) and
some random direction that overfits to the rare class. In contrast, self-supervised learning learns both
e1 and e2 directions from the frequent classes. Since how well the feature helps classify the rare

features that help classify the rare class, while supervised learning fails. This intuition is formalized

corresponds to our OOD evaluation scenario."

REFERENCES,0.44849785407725323,"Generating Pre-training Datasets. CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) contains 10 classes with
5000 examples per class. We use exponential imbalance, i.e. for class c, the number of examples is
5000 × eβ(c−1). we consider imbalance ratio r ∈{0.1, 0.01}, i.e. the number of examples belonging
to the rarest class is 500 or 50. The total ns is therefore 20431 or 12406. ImageNet-LT is constructed
by Liu et al. (2019), which follows the Pareto distribution with the power value 6. The number
of examples from the rarest class is 5. We construct a long tailed ImageNet following the Pareto
distribution with more imbalance, where the number of examples from the rarest class is 3. The total
number of examples ns is 115846 and 80218 respectively. For each ratio of imbalance, we further
downsample the dataset with the sampling ratio in {0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125} to formulate different
number of examples. To compare with the balanced setting fairly, we also sample balanced versions
of datasets with the same number of examples. Note that each variant of the dataset is fixed after
construction for all algorithms. See the visualization of label distributions of dataset variants in
Figure 5."

learning rate decay. For down-sampled variants, the training epochs are selected with cross validation.
Fo self-supervised learning, the initial learning rate on the standard ImageNet-LT is set to 0.025

cosine learning rate decay following (He et al., 2020; Chen & He, 2021). We train the models for
more epochs on the down sampled variants to ensure the same number of total iterations. The code

10k, which is a reasonable scale as the number of examples of the pre-training dataset variants ranges
from 10k to 110k. The representation quality is evaluated with the average performance on the four
tasks. We set the initial learning rate to 0.1 in fine-tuning train for 150 epochs in total. For in-domain

classifier with supervision on the imbalanced dataset directly. CRT first trains the feature extractor
with supervision, and then re-trains the classifier with class-aware resampled loss. Note that CRT is
performing better than Supervised, indicating that the composition of the head and features learned

SUPERVISED LEARNING WITH DATASET IMBALANCE"
REFERENCES,0.5622317596566524,"There exists a long line of works studying supervised imbalanced classification (He & Garcia, 2009;
Krawczyk, 2016). Early works on ensemble learning adjusted the boosting and bagging algorithms
with resampling in the imbalanced setting (Guo & Viktor, 2004; Wang & Yao, 2009). Classical
methods include resampling and reweighting. Hart (1968); Kubat et al. (1997); Chawla et al. (2002);
He et al. (2008); Ando & Huang (2017); Buda et al. (2018); Hu et al. (2020) proposed to re-sample
the data to make the frequent and rare classes appear with equal frequency in training. Re-weighting
assigns different weights for head and tail classes and eases the optimization difficulty under class
imbalance (Cui et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2017b; Huang et al., 2019). Byrd &
Lipton (2019) empirically studied the effect of importance weighting and found out that importance
weighting does not change the solution without regularization. Xu et al. (2021) justified this finding
with theoretical analysis based on the implicit bias of gradient descend on separable data."
REFERENCES,0.5643776824034334,"Cao et al. (2019) initiated the idea of using re-weighted regularization and proposed the principle
of regularizing rare classes more heavily. Re-weighted regularizaton is shown to be typically more
effective than re-weighting or re-sampling the losses. Cao et al. (2021) proposed to regularize the
local curvature of loss on imbalanced and noisy datasets."

models during training. Meta-learning approaches meta-learned the weight or the ensemble (Wang
