ABSTRACT,0.001277139208173691,"The classical iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) algorithm aims to re-
cover an unknown signal from linear measurements by performing a sequence of
weighted least squares problems, where the weights are recursively updated at each
step. Varieties of this algorithm have been shown to achieve favorable empirical
performance and theoretical guarantees for sparse recovery and ℓp-norm mini-
mization. Recently, some preliminary connections have also been made between
IRLS and certain types of non-convex linear neural network architectures that are
observed to exploit low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional linear models.
In this work, we provide a unified asymptotic analysis for a family of algorithms
that encompasses IRLS, the recently proposed lin-RFM algorithm (which was
motivated by feature learning in neural networks), and the alternating minimization
algorithm on linear diagonal neural networks. Our analysis operates in a “batched”
setting with i.i.d. Gaussian covariates and shows that, with appropriately chosen
reweighting policy, the algorithm can achieve favorable performance in only a
handful of iterations. We also extend our results to the case of group-sparse re-
covery and show that leveraging this structure in the reweighting scheme provably
improves test error compared to coordinate-wise reweighting."

desirable structural properties. In many important applications, it is desirable to obtain a sparsity-
seeking solution; in such cases, the regularizer is typically non-smooth, as in the LASSO, group
LASSO, and nuclear norm regularizers. As an alternative approach to this non-smooth optimization,
several recent works have proposed the “Hadamard over-parameterization” of θ into the entry-
wise product of two factors u ⊙v. While the resulting minimization problem is non-convex, this"

performance (in terms of numerical stability, robustness, and convergence rate) when compared to
traditional sparse recovery algorithms [13, 25]. For example, rather than solving the convex, but non-

yields the following non-convex and smooth formulation:"

weight matrix diag(v). In this context, this linear diagonal neural network (LDNN) architecture has
also been studied as an illustrative case study to improve our understanding of how neural networks
perform iterative “feature learning” to leverage low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional

INTRODUCTION,0.020434227330779056,"While several methods for learning Hadamard/LDNN parameterizations have been introduced in the
literature, there remain many open questions about how they each perform and how they compare.
Theoretical analyses of these algorithms typically assume fixed, possibly worst-case training data,
and aim to characterize the properties of the fixed-points [28, 34] or give convergence guarantees
to second-order stationary points [25]. However, these worst-case analyses do not readily yield
guarantees on the estimation error, which is the principal metric of interest. Indeed, many works have
shown that studying the average-case, or typical, behavior of non-convex optimization algorithms
can allow for estimation guarantees that are more precise and reflective of practice [14, 18, 7]."

RELATED WORK,0.04086845466155811,"IRLS and the η-trick: The reformulation of non-smooth regularizers in terms of quadratic variational
forms (the “η-trick”) has been studied in various early works in computer vision and robust statistics
[12, 4]. Further analysis and examples of sparsity-promoting norms are provided in [20, 2], and
[25] provides a characterization of when a regularizer admits a variational form of this type. The
resultant optimization algorithm is iteratively-reweighted least-squares (IRLS), a popular technique
for compressive sensing and sparse recovery [11, 9]. These works also consider IRLS algorithms
corresponding to ℓp-norm regularization for 0 < p < 1; in this case, the minimization is no longer
convex, but [11] shows that such methods can find sparse solutions with fast local convergence rate.
The family of algorithms we consider includes a reparameterized version of each of these IRLS
algorithms, but unlike these prior works, we consider a batched setting and the high-dimensional
asymptotic regime. Moreover, our results apply to other algorithms which may not be easily expressed
as resulting from the η-trick."
RELATED WORK,0.0421455938697318,"Hadamard parameterization and linear diagonal networks: The reparameterization of θ into
the product of factors u ⊙v has been considered in a variety of recent works. The authors of
[31, 35] show that early-stopped joint gradient descent over the two factors can lead to optimal
sample complexity for sparse linear regression. The equivalence of this parameterization to LDNNs
has also led to a surge of interest in the implicit bias of gradient descent/flow on this parameterization,
i.e., a characterization of which solution gradient descent will reach without explicit regularization
(corresponding to λ = 0). These works typically consider gradient flow run until completion and
characterize the solution as a minimizer of a certain sparsity-inducing functional that depends on the
initialization [34, 10, 23]."
RELATED WORK,0.04342273307790549,"The connection between the LASSO (as well as some non-convex ℓq penalties) and the Hadamard
parameterization was studied in [13], where alternating minimization over the two factors is used
instead of first-order methods. More recently, [25] extends these observations by making explicit the
connection to the η-trick and showing that saddle points are strict (escapable). These insights lead to
global convergence guarantees and a smooth bi-level optimization scheme [25, 26] for non-smooth
structured optimization problems that was shown to perform competitively with state-of-the-art
solvers. The non-convex landscape of such formulations is further explored in [15], where it is
shown that for a large class of parameterizations (including grouped, deep, and fractional Hadamard
products), the non-convex problem has no spurious local minima. Motivated by the type of feature
learning observed in neural networks, the authors of [28] propose lin-RFM, which updates one of the
parameters via weighted least-squares while iteratively updating the other parameter via a reweighting
scheme based on the average gradient outer product of the learned function. The authors characterize"
RELATED WORK,0.04469987228607918,"properties of the fixed-points and show that, for certain reweighting schemes, lin-RFM is equivalent
to a reparameterization of IRLS. The family of algorithms we consider is similar, consisting of a
weighted least-squares step and a reweighting step; however, it is more general and doesn’t require
the reweighting function to have the particular form required by lin-RFM. Moreover, our asymptotic
characterization of the iterates allows for a precise understanding of how the test error evolves. On
the other hand, our analysis relies on batching/sample-splitting of training data while all of the above
works reuse the entire batch of training data at each iteration."
RELATED WORK,0.04597701149425287,"We make particular note here of the few works which explicitly consider a “grouped” Hadamard

weights in the hidden layer. Early stopped gradient flow/descent for this type of architecture was
shown in [17] to achieve sample-complexity scaling with the number of non-zero groups (rather than
the overall sparsity). The non-convex landscape for this grouped architecture is studied in [36] and
[15]. Our results complement these works by studying group-reweighted least-squares algorithms
(rather than gradient methods) for learning functions of this form."
RELATED WORK,0.04725415070242656,"Precise characterization of higher-order non-convex optimization problems: On a technical level,
our work provides a precise deterministic characterization of a family of higher-order optimization

inequalities are used to obtain a precise characterization of non-convex optimization problems.
However, since the Hadamard parameterization is a re-parameterization of the actual estimator of
interest (θ := u ⊙v), the results of [7] are not directly applicable. While our results are asymptotic
and do not provide finite-sample guarantees, we provide a distributional characterization of v after
each reweighting step, which allows us to characterize the behavior of more complicated functions of
the iterates. Precise characterizations of alternating minimization and lin-prox methods for rank-1
matrix sensing are studied in the works [6, 19]. While these works obtain non-asymptotic guarantees,
the estimation model and resulting optimization objective are quite different, with each unknown
parameter interacting with independent sensing vectors (rather than a single sensing vector interacting
with the product of the two parameters)."

D,0.15708812260536398,"v(t) is not necessarily bounded uniformly for t > 1. A second key difference is that we need to
obtain a distributional characterization which can be applied recursively for all t ≥0. The analysis in
[8] assumes convergence of the initialization in W4 distance and proves convergence of the estimator
in W3 distance. However, to apply the result recursively in our setting, if assume that the empirical
distribution of (v(0), θ∗) converges in Wk distance, then we need to show that after one iteration, the
iterates also converge in Wk distance (and not in any weaker sense)."
D,0.1583652618135377,"To overcome these differences, we use a different technique to show distributional convergence of the
iterates. Similar to the approach in [5], we apply the CGMT to a perturbed optimization problem,
which ultimately allows us to show convergence of test functions of the solutions to the unperturbed
problem. While this approach necessitates the additional assumption that θ∗has bounded entries
and we obtain results for a slightly smaller family of test functions g (note, for example, that the
squared loss g(u, v, θ) = (uv −θ)2 is not PL(2)), we obtain a distributional convergence result
that can be applied to a sequence of recursively defined least-squares problems which define the
trajectory of an algorithm, rather than to a single optimization problem. Moreover, our simulations
in Appendix D suggest that the predictions of Theorem 1 still often apply without these additional
assumptions, including in the case of the squared loss, indicating that these additional assumptions
could potentially be weakened with a more complicated analysis."

APPLICATION TO SPARSE LINEAR REGRESSION,0.16091954022988506,"In this subsection, we apply Theorem 1 to a sparse recovery setting and compare the asymptotic
predictions to numerical simulations on high-dimensional Gaussian data. First, we consider a setting
where n = 250, d = 2000, and θ∗has Bernoulli(0.01) entries (so the expected sparsity level is
E[s] = 20). We run Algorithm 4 with initialization v(0) = 1d for four different choices of reweighting
function and display the test error at each iteration (median over 100 trials) in Figure 1. For each
choice of reweighting function ψ, we choose the regularization parameter λ that minimizes the
asymptotic test loss achieved within 8 iterations, and we plot the corresponding trajectory. As shown
in the figure, the numerical simulations show excellent alignment with the asymptotic predictions
even for this moderate choice of n and d."

and ψ = tanh u2 seem to find better solutions after several iterations. Interestingly, the weighting
functions which depend only on u (like alternating minimization) sometimes display a non-monotonic,
oscillatory decay of the test loss, particularly in the low-noise regime. However, we do see a steady
decrease in test error after every pair of iterations (e.g., in AM, after both parameters have been
updated). Finally, we note that our framework allows for analysis of new algorithms for training
LDNNs. In particular, to our knowledge, weighting functions of the form ϕ(u2) have not been
previously considered for this task, but our results indicate that this small modification to AM is
competitive with many existing algorithms in this setting."

CONCLUSION,0.227330779054917,"In this paper, we derived a precise asymptotic characterization of the iterates of a family of algorithms
for learning high-dimensional linear models with linear diagonal networks. We used these predictions
to obtain fine-grained predictions of the test error at each iteration for various existing algorithms
for this task, and we showed that our framework can also be used as a test bed for new variations on
these algorithms that take a similar form. Lastly, we demonstrated the advantage of embedding more
structure into the model by tying together groups of weights when the ground-truth has structured
sparsity. Several interesting open questions about these types of algorithms remain. While our
simulations align very well with the predicted asymptotic trajectory, it would be interesting to obtain
finite-sample guarantees that hold even for batch sizes that are much smaller than d (as in the “mini-
batch” case studied by [19]). Moreover, seeing as our analysis depends crucially on the independence
the covariates at every iteration, developing precise predictions of the trajectory in the non-batched
setting remains an interesting direction for future work."

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper."
LIMITATIONS,0.9284802043422733,2. Limitations
LIMITATIONS,0.929757343550447,Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
LIMITATIONS,0.9310344827586207,Answer: [Yes]
LIMITATIONS,0.9323116219667944,"Justification: We provide detailed discussion of the strength of our technical assumptions
after the statement of Theorem 1 and in Appendix D, and we further elaborate on these areas
for improvement in the conclusion."
LIMITATIONS,0.933588761174968,Guidelines:
LIMITATIONS,0.9348659003831418,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper."
LIMITATIONS,0.9361430395913155,"• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs"
LIMITATIONS,0.9374201787994891,"Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We formally state and discuss Assumptions 1 and 2, and we provide a complete
proof of our results in the Appendix A of the supplemental material.
Guidelines:"
LIMITATIONS,0.9386973180076629,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility"
LIMITATIONS,0.9399744572158365,"Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide all details of hyperparameters used to run simulations in the corre-
sponding figure caption. We also detail the exact method used to compute our asymptotic
predictions in Appendix C and provide accompanying code for the simulations.
Guidelines:"
LIMITATIONS,0.9412515964240102,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not."
LIMITATIONS,0.9425287356321839,"• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code"
LIMITATIONS,0.9438058748403576,"Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide an accompanying file with code for computing the asymptotic
predictions and running simulations with high-dimensional Gaussian data.
Guidelines:"
LIMITATIONS,0.9450830140485313,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details"
LIMITATIONS,0.946360153256705,"Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: For each simulation, hyperparameter choices (and the method for choosing the
ridge parameter λ) are specified either in the caption or in the accompanying discussion in
the text.
Guidelines:"
LIMITATIONS,0.9476372924648787,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance"
LIMITATIONS,0.9489144316730523,"Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report the median and interquartile range for all simulations over 100
independent trials. These metrics are chosen due to the asymmetry of the distribution across
trials (e.g., the mean minus the standard deviation might be negative in low-noise settings).
Guidelines:"
LIMITATIONS,0.9501915708812261,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources"
LIMITATIONS,0.9514687100893997,"Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Due to the small-scale of our included simulations, we do not include this
information.
Guidelines:"
LIMITATIONS,0.9527458492975734,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage."
LIMITATIONS,0.9540229885057471,"• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual

BROADER IMPACTS,0.9680715197956578,Guidelines:
BROADER IMPACTS,0.9693486590038314,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML)."

SAFEGUARDS,0.9757343550446999,Guidelines:
SAFEGUARDS,0.9770114942528736,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort."
