ABSTRACT,0.003676470588235294,"Can artiﬁcial agents learn to assist others in achieving their goals without knowing
what those goals are? Generic reinforcement learning agents could be trained to
behave altruistically towards others by rewarding them for altruistic behaviour,
i.e., rewarding them for beneﬁting other agents in a given situation. Such an
approach assumes that other agents’ goals are known so that the altruistic agent
can cooperate in achieving those goals. However, explicit knowledge of other
agents’ goals is often difﬁcult to acquire. In the case of human agents, their goals
and preferences may be difﬁcult to express fully; they might be ambiguous or
even contradictory. Thus, it is beneﬁcial to develop agents that do not depend
on external supervision and learn altruistic behaviour in a task-agnostic manner.
We propose to act altruistically towards other agents by giving them more choice
and allowing them to achieve their goals better. Some concrete examples include
opening a door for others or safeguarding them to pursue their objectives without
interference. We formalize this concept and propose an altruistic agent that learns
to increase the choices another agent has by preferring to maximize the number
of states that the other agent can reach in its future. We evaluate our approach in
three different multi-agent environments where another agent’s success depends
on altruistic behaviour. Finally, we show that our unsupervised agents can perform
comparably to agents explicitly trained to work cooperatively, in some cases even
outperforming them."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.011029411764705883,"Altruistic behaviour is often described as behaviour that is intended to beneﬁt others, sometimes at
a cost for the actor (Dowding and Monroe, 1997; Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003). Such behaviour is a
desirable trait when integrating artiﬁcial intelligence into various aspects of human life and society
– such as personal artiﬁcial assistants, house or warehouse robots, autonomous vehicles, and even
recommender systems for news and entertainment. By observing and interacting with us, we may
expect that artiﬁcial agents could adapt to our behaviour and objectives, and learn to act helpfully
and selﬂessly. Altruistic behaviour could be a step towards value alignment (Allen et al., 2005;
Gabriel, 2020), which aims to incorporate common-sense human values into artiﬁcial agents."
INTRODUCTION,0.014705882352941176,"Typically, we could achieve such an altruistic behaviour through various forms of supervision such
as providing ground-truth actions at each time step, training agents with reinforcement learning
(RL) and suitable rewards, or through imitation learning (Song et al., 2018). However, none of the
approaches above scale up easily. They either require a large amount of supervision or carefully
crafted rewards that can easily be misstated, leading to unwanted behaviour (Russell, 2019, ch. 1)."
INTRODUCTION,0.01838235294117647,"How can one agent support another agent without knowing its goals?
One clue might be the
instrumental convergence hypothesis (Bostrom, 2017; Omohundro, 2008; Russell, 2019), which
states that intelligent agents with varied goals are likely to pursue common subgoals which are
generally useful (instrumental). Some examples are resource acquisition, cognitive enhancement or
self-preservation, which all increase an agent’s chance of achieving almost arbitrary ﬁnal goals. This
hypothesis has been validated theoretically under many models, including resource games (Benson-
Tilsen and Soares, 2016) and large classes of policies in discrete MDPs (Turner et al., 2019)."

INTRODUCTION,0.025735294117647058,"While instrumental convergence is central to the discussion of value alignment and safe
AI (Bostrom, 2017), since many instrumental subgoals have harmful effects, we believe that it is
also a key to supporting agents with ill-deﬁned goals and values, such as humans. The reason is that
enabling instrumental subgoals for other agents (or not impeding them) can be beneﬁcial, for a wide
variety of goals and preferences. Since these subgoals occur frequently for rational agents, enabling
them has the highest chance of success in the absence of more information about the other agent’s
preferences, even if it is not guaranteed in the worst case."
INTRODUCTION,0.029411764705882353,"We speculate that having the ability to reach many future states is one of the most general convergent
subgoals. It subsumes self-preservation (avoiding absorbent states), resource acquisition (if they
are prerequisites to some actions), and generally maintaining the ability to pursue many goals.
There is theoretical evidence that many optimal agents pursue this subgoal (Turner et al., 2019) (see
sec. 3.2). Thus, we propose to train agents to support other agents by maximizing their choice (future
state availability). This unsupervised approach learns altruistic behaviour without any extrinsic
supervision such as rewards or expert demonstrations."
INTRODUCTION,0.03308823529411765,"We evaluate our methods in three diverse multi-agent environments. We always assume there are
at least two agents: the leader agent that executes its own policy and can be trained using standard
supervised methods, and an altruistic agent whose role is to help the leader. The performance of
the altruistic agent is thus deﬁned as the reward (success) achieved by the leader agent. In all our
environments, the overall success of the leader agent depends on the altruistic agents’ behaviour. We
show that our unsupervised approach outperforms unsupervised baselines by a large margin and, in
some cases, also outperforms the supervised ones. Finally, we demonstrate possible failure cases of
our approach where maximising the leader agent’s choice can lead to suboptimal behaviour."
INTRODUCTION,0.03676470588235294,Our work makes the following three contributions:
INTRODUCTION,0.04044117647058824,"• We devise a multi-agent RL framework for intrinsically motivated artiﬁcial agents that act
altruistically by maximising the choice of others.
• We deﬁne and evaluate three task-agnostic methods to estimate the choice that an agent has
in a given situation, which are all related to the variety in states it can reach.
• We experimentally evaluate our unsupervised approach in three multi-agent environments

assume that the leader acts Boltzmann-rationally, i.e. that it chooses high-value actions with higher
probability. We believe this to be a reasonable assumption, as, in comparison to deterministic
policies, stochastic policies are more robust (Zhang et al., 2020), and often achieve better results

two distinct actions a and a′ taken at a state s′, leading into two sets of possible future states (for
an inﬁnite horizon). These sets of future states are represented as nodes in two graphs, respectively
G and G′ (with edges weighted by the probability of transitioning from one state to another). They
also assume that the states in G ∪G′ can only be reached from s′ by taking actions a or a′. In the
case where G is “similar” to a subgraph of G′, in the sense that they are equivalent up to arbitrary
swapping of pairs of states, the authors prove that the probability of a being optimal is higher than
the probability of a′ being optimal (for most reward function distributions). Therefore, if G′ contains
more states than G, an optimal agent will choose a′ over a."

hyperparameter in maximum entropy single-agent RL (Haarnoja and Abbeel, 2018). We ﬁnd that

LEVEL-BASED FORAGING EXPERIMENTS,0.28308823529411764,"Computational efﬁciency.
Due to the computational complexity resulting from the need to
estimate a long-term distribution of states, p(st+n|st), we focus on immediate choice (IC) to estimate
the leader agent’s choice in the remaining sections. Furthermore, in rare state-action sequences, the
assumptions made for IC, i.e. deterministic environment transitions and an injective relationship
from actions to states, may not hold. Nonetheless, we did not ﬁnd this to adversely affect the results.
Due to its dependence on access to the environment simulator and its computational complexity, we
do not consider the AvE baseline for the remainder of experiments."
LEVEL-BASED FORAGING EXPERIMENTS,0.2867647058823529,"Setup.
We use a fully-observable multi-agent environment that enables us to assess the level of
cooperation among agents (level-based foraging, LBF, Christianos et al. (2020)) to evaluate the
performance of altruistic agents in more complex environments with discrete state spaces. We
compare our method to a maximum-entropy approach from single-agent RL (Mutti et al., 2020)
and a random-policy baseline. A visualization of the environment is depicted in Fig. 2 (left). The
two agents can forage apples by simultaneously taking positions at different sides of a targeted apple,
yielding a ﬁxed reward. We ﬁrst train two agents – which receive an equal reward for foraging –
using Deep Q-Learning (DQL, Van Hasselt et al. (2015)), corresponding to fully-supervised shared-
reward in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We then take one of these pretrained agents
that has learned to forage apples when accompanied by a cooperating agent, freeze its policy, and
place it as the leader agent (green) into the test scenario (additional details are provided in app. C)."

We observe that the leader agent’s estimated choice is substantially higher when it is able to acquire
high rewards. Note that the IC estimate does not have privileged access to the reward function of the
leader agent, and so this experiment evaluates its worth as a generic proxy for the leader’s reward.
Assuming that an agent is able to acquire higher rewards when having more choice, these results
indicate that IC is a reasonable estimator for the leader agent’s choice in LBF."
LEVEL-BASED FORAGING EXPERIMENTS,0.3088235294117647,"Training. We now consider an environment that consists of the previously pretrained leader and an
additional altruistic agent, which is trained from scratch and does not receive a reward for foraging
apples, but is rewarded according to the leader agent’s choice. Its reward is given as the current
estimate of the leader agent’s IC (eq. 3) and it is trained using DQL. To compute its internal reward
signal, the altruistic agent would therefore need to estimate the state transition probabilities, as
detailed in A.2. To decouple our approach’s performance from that of the state transition estimator,
we instead directly compute the altruistic agent’s reward using the leader agent’s policy."

as the reward achieved by the leader agent, i.e. its performance in enabling the leader agent to

baselines (two unsupervised and one supervised), averaged over 5 random seeds, with the standard
deviation as the shaded area. It can be observed that the performance of the altruistic agent converges
to a similar performance to that of the supervised agent, and outperforms the baseline approaches
by a large margin. Furthermore, the IC improvement of the leader agent is correlated with its reward
improvement, which supports using IC as a reasonable proxy for the choice of the leader agent."

MULTI-AGENT TAG GAME WITH PROTECTIVE AGENTS,0.35294117647058826,"Results.
Performance of the altruistic agents is deﬁned as the times per episode that the leader
agent is caught by the adversaries, i.e. the lower the better. In Table 2, the performance of the
team of three altruistically trained agents (ours) is compared to three relevant baselines, with the
altruistic agents either removed (None), acting randomly (random), or solely receiving a small
negative reward for violating the environment boundaries (cage). In contrast to LBF, we do not
compare to an unsupervised exploration approach, as we are not aware of such an implementation
for cooperative MARL. Additionally, we report results for the case in which the altruistic agents
receive the same reward as the leader agent (supervised), possibly appended by a negative reward
for violating the environment boundaries (supervised + cage). It can be observed that our approach
outperforms all relevant baselines by a substantial margin and also outperforms the supervised
approach. We hypothesize this to be due to the dense internal reward signal that our approach
provides, as compared to the sparse rewards in the supervised scenario: recall that in the supervised
scenario the additional altruistic agents receive a large negative reward only when the leader agent is
caught by the adversaries, whereas our approach provides a dense reward signal that corresponds to
the current estimate of the leader agent’s choice. Fig. 5 displays the emerging protective behaviour
of altruistic agents trained with our approach. Results videos are found in the supplemental material."

CONCLUSIONS"
CONCLUSIONS,0.3602941176470588,"We lay out some initial steps into developing artiﬁcial agents that learn altruistic behaviour from
observations and interactions with other agents. Our experimental results demonstrate that artiﬁcial
agents can behave altruistically towards other agents without knowledge of their objective or any
external supervision, by actively maximizing their choice. This objective is justiﬁed by theoretical
work on instrumental convergence, which shows that for a large proportion of rational agents this
will be a useful subgoal, and thus can be leveraged to design generally altruistic agents."
CONCLUSIONS,0.3639705882352941,"This work was motivated by a desire to address the potential negative outcomes of deploying
agents that are oblivious to the values and objectives of others into the real world.
As such,
we hope that our work serves both as a baseline and facilitator for future research into value
alignment in simulation settings, and as a complementary objective to standard RL that biases the
behaviour towards more altruistic policies. In addition to the positive impacts of deployed altruistic
agents outside of simulation, we remark that altruistic proxy objectives do not yet come with strict
guarantees of optimizing for other agents’ rewards, and identify failure modes (sec. 4.1) which are
hyperparameter-dependent, and which we hope provide interesting starting points for future work."

MOTIVATION AND OVERVIEW"
REFERENCES,0.9191176470588235,"This environment is a special case of the general resource-based MDP proposed by Benson-Tilsen
and Soares (2016), which they used to show that intelligent agents pursue instrumentally useful
subgoals. The motivation behind the choice for this environment is to evaluate our proposal in
non-spatial and non-navigation environments."
REFERENCES,0.9227941176470589,"In the environment, there are 3 resource types, which two “consumer” agents may consume as an
action. Each consumer has different preferences (reward function), and so will only consume 2 of
the resource types. A third, altruistic agent, receives one resource unit of each type to distribute
among the consumers, and its goal is to satisfy the preferences of the consumers without knowing
their reward function. We deﬁne its performance as the average number of times that the consumers
fail to consume their preferred resource (so lower is better). We compare our method to a supervised
agent that is explicitly trained with the consumers’ reward function, as well as to an agent that
assigns the resources randomly."

ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTION"
REFERENCES,0.9301470588235294,"The environment is expressed as a Markov Game (see section 3). The Markov game is composed
of two human-inspired consumers with subscript C1, C2 and an altruistic agent with subscript A.
Three types of resources exist, RX, RY and RZ. The environment state s is given by the number
of resources of each type available to each of the consumers. For example, s = [(1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0)]
means that agent C1 has one resource each of type X and Y available, while agent C2 only has one
resource of type Z available. At the beginning of each time step, the altruistic agent is provided
with one resource per category, i.e. RX, RY and RZ. The altruistic agent can assign each resource
individually to any agent or discard the resource. The altruistic agent’s action space is hence deﬁned
by one sub-action per resource, i.e. aA = (aX
A , aY
A, aZ
A). Each sub-action assigns the resource either
to one of the consumers or discards it. The resources are then distributed according to the action
taken by the altruistic agent and the environment state is updated. Resources cannot be stacked,
which means that each agent can only have one resource per category available at a time. Next, the
consumers attempt to consume one resource each, according to their preference. Agent C1 dislikes
resource RZ, hence it chooses RX or RY with equal probability. Agent C2 dislikes resource RX,
hence it chooses RY or RZ with equal probability. The actions of agents C1 and C2 are sampled
accordingly and the environment state is updated. For each round, we record how many agents failed
to consume a resource that was not available."

TRAINING"
REFERENCES,0.9375,"The altruistic agent is trained with Q-Learning (Watkins and Dayan, 1992) to maximize the
discounted future choice of the consumers (see eq. 4). For that, it uses one of the three proposed
objectives, namely IC (eq. 3), EC (eq. 2) or DC (eq. 1), which it estimates as detailed in appendix
A.1. The exact hyper-parameters are given in Table 4. We compare the performance of the altruistic
agent that maximizes the choice of the consumers to that of a supervised agent. The reward of the
supervised agent is the negative of the number of consumers that attempted to consume a resource,
in that time step, and failed. Further, we compare to a random-policy baseline that distributes the
resources randomly but does not discard any resources."

RESULTS"

to those achieved by the supervised agent. Furthermore, they are signiﬁcantly better than those
achieved by an agent with a random policy."
