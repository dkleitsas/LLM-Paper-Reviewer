ABSTRACT,0.0,ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT,0.005128205128205128,"With the overabundance of data for machines to process in the current state of
machine learning, data discovery, organization, and interpretation of the data be-
comes a critical need. Speciﬁcally of need are unsupervised methods that do not
require laborious labeling by human observers. One promising approach to this
enedeavour is Disentanglement, which aims at learning the underlying genera-
tive latent factors of the data. The factors should also be as human interpretable
as possible for the purposes of data discovery. Unsupervised disentanglement
is a particularly difﬁcult open subset of the problem, which asks the network to
learn on its own the generative factors without any link to the true labels. This
problem area is currently dominated by two approaches: Variational Autoencoder
and Generative Adversarial Network approaches. While GANs have good perfor-
mance, they suffer from difﬁculty in training and mode collapse, and while VAEs
are stable to train, they do not perform as well as GANs in terms of interpretabil-
ity. In current state of the art versions of these approaches, the networks require
the user to specify the number of factors that we expect to ﬁnd in the data. This
limitation prevents “true” disentanglement, in the sense that learning how many
factors is actually one of the tasks we wish the network to solve. In this work
we propose a novel network for unsupervised disentanglement that combines the
stable training of the VAE with the interpretability offered by GANs without the
training instabilities. We aim to disentangle interpretable latent factors “one at a
time”, or OAT factor learning, making no prior assumptions about the number or
distribution of factors, in a completely unsupervised manner. We demonstrate its
quantitative and qualitative effectiveness by evaluating the latent representations
learned on three benchmark datasets; DSprites, 3DShapes and CelebA."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.015384615384615385,"Deep learning models, which are now widely adopted across multiple A.I. tasks ranging from vision
to music generation to game playing (Krizhevsky et al., 2017; Oord et al., 2016; Mnih et al., 2015),
owe their success to their ability to learn representations from the data rather than requiring hand-
crafted features that older models required. However, this self-learning of abstract representations
comes at the known cost of the resulting representations being cryptic and inscrutable to human
observers. These learned representations might be dramatically affected by noise or spurious corre-
lations between the data and the labels - the representations might encode ’useless’ information from
the input data which is correlated with the corresponding label Geirhos et al. (2020). This makes
them more vulnerable to slight changes in the data distribution. A more comprehensive understand-
ing of the data down to essential indivisible factors would allow us to learn insights, sort and label
data, and facilitate downstream learning more efﬁciently. This also requires, critically, that these
factors be somehow interpretable as well. This approach, dubbed Disentanglement. requires that we
learn the data from its fundamental building block, so-called “disentangling” the true factors - the
factors of variation - that generate the data. If one were to learn these factors, one would learn all
possible causes of variation in a given dataset, and would in some sense gain complete understand-
ing of the underlying machinery, so to speak. In this work, we propose a new method that attempts
to learn the true disentangled factors one at a time, in a way that maintains interpretability for future
use."

WHAT IS A DISENTANGLED REPRESENTATION?"
INTRODUCTION,0.035897435897435895,"While it is easy to informally talk of factors of variation, actually pinning down concrete deﬁnitions
of disentangled learning has proved a somewhat more difﬁcult task. Though there is no commonly
accepted formalized notion of disentanglement or validation metrics (Higgins et al., 2018), recent
works have characterized disentangled representations, based on natural intuition, as one which
encodes each informative factor of variation of the data in separate latent dimenions (Bengio, 2013),
such that a change in single factor of variation produces a change in only a subset of the learned latent
representation. This is refered to as the separability (Do & Tran, 2020) quality of the representations,
also called disentanglement (Eastwood & Williams, 2018) and modularity (Ridgeway & Mozer,
2018). Separability ensures that the downstream tasks which depend on a certain subset of factors
are not affected by changes in other factors thus facilitating robust models Suter et al. (2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.041025641025641026,"Some previous works (Ridgeway & Mozer, 2018; Eastwood & Williams, 2018) have suggested
that a single dimension of the learned disentangled representation should completely describe a
factor. This constraint along with separability entails a bijective mapping between the true factors of
variation and the learned representation. However, enforcing this constraint might not be conducive
to learn complex factors in a single latent variable Esmaeili et al. (2018). Hence in this work we
focus primarily on separability. For an in depth discussion on interpretability and how we enforce it
in the proposed work, we refer the reader to A.1."

WHAT IS MISSING FROM CURRENT APPROACHES TO SOLVING DISENTANGLEMENT?"
INTRODUCTION,0.05128205128205128,"Due to the monumentous task of learning data without supervision, current methods have attempted
to tackle the subproblems of separability and interpretability, but few have successfully solved both
at once. Learning these disentangled representations in a semi-supervised setting Kulkarni et al.
(2015); Siddharth et al. (2017); Locatello et al. (2019) is a relatively easier task where additional
annotated data is available that give a strong backpropgation gradient to the network to guide it
to cleanly separate factors. However, if the main goal of disentanglement is to discover unknown
factors in large data corpuses, then it is not the right direction to require labels; rather the network
should learn in an unsupervised fashion. For unstructured data, all current state of the art approaches
based on unsupervised disentanglement rely on a deep generative neural network, built either on a
Variational Autoencoder or Generative Adversarial Network structure (See Related Work.) Many
popular VAE based methods are able to do well in separating factors out but make strict assumptions
on the number of factors and their structure and those that do, do not explicitly attempt to also make
the factors interpretable. Other methods based on GANs suffer from common issues from training of
GANs, but also tend to only learn a small subset of factors (See 2). Here we propose a novel hybrid
network that provides the stability and strong gradients of VAE training with the performance of
GAN training, without mode collapse."
INTRODUCTION,0.05641025641025641,"Most current VAE-based state of the art methods make the assumption that there are a ﬁxed number
of independent factors for all the data points in the dataset. However in real datasets, in addition
to the independent factors common to all points in the dataset, there might also be some correlated,
nuisance or noisy factors pertinent to speciﬁcally only certain data points. Moreover, approaches
rely on a heuristically chosen latent dimension d, sufﬁciently large to encompass all true factors.
However, this suffers from the same pitfalls for many of the same reasons that algorithms like k-
means cluster do, namely that given a new, unseen dataset, we do not necessarily know how many
independent factors there are. In fact, this is one of the main goals of disentanglement in the ﬁrst
place, to glean insights about the data. Our method instead assumes that there is a set of independent
factors, and one of entangled nuisance and correlated factors, and separates them out. We then
iteratively learn to disentangle each factor of variation one at a time, such that the network learns on
its own different independently controllable factors thus removing a current hand-tuned roadblock
on the way to true unsupervised disentanglement. Second, in the same training loop, we ensure that
the disentangled latent representation follows intepretable latent code manipulation (Section. 1.1),
which says that a change in a single latent should make a distinct and noticeable change in the output
(Eastwood & Williams, 2018). Together, we demonstrate our proposed model is able to learn both
critical qualities of disentanglement, in a completely unsupervised manner."

reconstructions to be closer together in latent space. VAEs assume that the data x is generated from a
set of latent features z with a prior p(z) according to the model pθ(x|z)p(z). The top-down generator
pθ(x|z) and a bottom up inference network qφ(z|x) are modeled as multilayer neural networks and

explicitly learning the parameters of an encoder distribution), as the entire GAN model relies on

this paper, however, we use the method of interventions while training the model to ﬁnd disentangle
common factors from their entangled set. (Lee et al., 2020) use a VAE to disentangle and then pass
into a GAN to generate high-ﬁdelity images; our approach differs in that the GAN component is
tightly integrated into our training loop, we perform interventions, and we split the latents into two
spaces (See Sec. 3). Hu et al. (2018) condition the latent space of entangled representations with a
disentangled code, which they learn in a supervised way using speciﬁc attribute discriminators. As
far as the authors are aware, we are the ﬁrst to split the latent dimension into entangled and disentan-
gled in a completely unsupervised way, as well as the ﬁrst to combine this with interventions, and
with incremental learning."

GENERATIVE DISENTANGLEMENT"
GENERATIVE DISENTANGLEMENT,0.18461538461538463,"Most previous works on disentanglement take a generative view of data where they assume that an
unknown generative model has produced the data. The data is assumed to be composed from an
a-priori set of factors of variation Gk(k = 1, · · · , K′), which contains the different human-deﬁned
atomic features that assume different values for speciﬁc instances. Here, K′ is assumed to be the
“true” number of independent factors of variation in the data. The data is then assumed to be gener-
ated by a two-step process. First, the values of the different factors of variation, g, are sampled from
a factorized distribution p(G) = QK′"
GENERATIVE DISENTANGLEMENT,0.18974358974358974,"k=1 p(Gk), where p can be any probability distribution. A gen-
erator function p(x|G) then maps the speciﬁc values, g, sampled from p(G), to a high-dimensional
datapoint x. Thus, p(x|g) describes a causal mechanism (Suter et al., 2019) invariant to changes in
the distributions p(gi). In this generative view the aim of disentangled representation learning then
becomes to uncover these “true” factors of variation from the data alone and re-encode each factor
as an independent latent representation."
GENERATIVE DISENTANGLEMENT,0.19487179487179487,"We posit, however, that this generative view of disentanglement is too limiting and restrictive when
it comes to real-world data, as described in section 1.1. Even though the factors are independent
concepts, knowing what observation of x we obtained renders the different latent causes dependent"

GENERATIVE DISENTANGLEMENT,0.20512820512820512,"as certain factor realizations tend to co-occur more than others as a characteristic of the dataset. In
the proposed work we do not assume any particular factorization of the distribution of the factors
of variation and instead separate out the factors through iterative interventions from their entangled
counterpart as discussed in further sections. These interventions ensure that the dimensions of the
latent representation are independently controllable and have no causal effect on each other. More-
over, independent interventions also ensure that the confounding variables for the different factors
are integrated out. In addition to the generative factors of variation of the dataset, we also model a
second set of entangled, correlated nuisance factors pertinent to that particular data point. We train
our network to systematically discern the meaningful latent factors shared across the dataset from
the nuisance ones, both of which are important to maximize the log-likelihood of the data (See 3.3
for details)."

DISJOINT ENTANGLED AND DISENTANGLED LATENT SETS,0.2153846153846154,"In practise training a VAE, guided by the reconstruction loss to maximize the log-likelihood of
the data does not lead to disentangled representations, i.e., do not adequately separate out all of
the factors within one latent space z. While constraints can be imposed on the latent space to
enforce independence between the different dimensions of the learned representations, they can lead
to blurry reconstructions (Kim & Mnih, 2019) where some factors might be ignored altogether.
Because of these practical limitations, we propose a novel method of splitting the latent space z into
two disjoint sets: the disentangled set z1 = {z1
1, z2
1, · · · , zK
1 } where zk
1 ∈R and the entangled set
z2 ∈Rd. Here, K is the number of factors that the network learns, and is not predetermined but

factors that are either correlated with the other factors in the dataset, or are noise factors that are
speciﬁc to individual samples, but are not representative of the dataset as a whole are encoded in z2
which has a higher encoding capacity. This ensures that the learning of the disentangled latent set
is not solely driven by the reconstruction cost. Our proposed model is the ﬁrst VAE-based model
to incorporate this notion of two sets of latent variables, which were used in a somewhat similar
manner in GANs in (Chen et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2020)."

convolutional neural networks, with an additional discriminator network attached (see Fig. 1). The
encoder and decoder network parameterize the posterior distribution of the latent representation
qφ(z|x) and the generative model distribution pθ(x|z) respectively. In addition to the standard VAE,
we attach a discriminator network Dw to the output of the VAE decoder. This ensures that the distri-
bution of images generated by the intervention procedure (See Sec 3.4.2) is close to the distribution
of the images in the training set and thus changes in the latent space translate only to interpretable
changes. This discriminator distinguishes between the true images in the dataset and generated
images by the decoder by using the “real or fake” paradigm of GAN training."

We use the boldface z to represent a vector-valued random variable. The encoder network encodes
the data into the two sets of latent variables qφ1(z1|x) and qφ2(z2|x), with φ1 and φ2 sharing weights

to produce a reconstructed image ˆx. The insight of OAT training is that it may not be possible to
decorrelate all of the data for various reasons, so we ﬁrst group the correlated latents into one space,
z2, and then “peel off” each independent factor one at a time. Next, an intervention is made on one
latent variable in the new disentangled space, z1
1, creating a new latent z1, which is passed through
the decoder to produce a new image ˆx1. This factor-reconstructed ˆx1 is then passed back through
the encoder to ensure the encoder learns how to encode that particular factor change into the same
intervention-altered disentangled latent z1. The factor-reconstructed values ˆx1 are then passed into a

posterior distribution of the disentangled set does not collapse to the prior."
OAT FACTOR DISENTANGLING,0.3384615384615385,"Step 2: Interventions and Change-Discriminator: In order to ensure that an independent, in-
terpretable factor of variation is encoded in zi
1, we perform interventions on each of the learned
dimensions of z1. Thus it is important for any particular dimension i in z1, that changing the value
of another dimension zj
1(j ̸= i) should not change the value of zi
1 when the corresponding gener-
ated data from the intervention is re-encoded. Interventions: For the intervention procedure, we
start with a learned representation z = {z1, z2} such that z1 ∼qφ1(z1|x) and z2 ∼qφ2(z2|x),
encoded from an some datapoint x. We then uniformly select a dimension k ∈[K] from the learned
dimensions of z1 to change it’s value during intervention. We sample a new value for the dimension
k from the prior distribution p(zk
1) say c to create a new representation zk = ({c, z\k
1 }, z2). Thus
the two representations are same in all dimensions except k. The new representation is then passed
through the decoder to generate a data point ˆxk. This generated data is then re-passed back through
the encoder to obtain the representations ˆzk = ({ˆc, ˆz\k
1 }, ˆz2) sampled from the encoder distribu-
tions qφ1(z1|ˆxk) and qφ2(z2|ˆxk) respectively. Both the encoder and the decoder are then trained to
reconstruct zk according to 6. We refer to this procedure of altering a single factor, combined with
data generation and re-passing through the encoder, an intervention, per Suter et al. (2019)."
OAT FACTOR DISENTANGLING,0.3435897435897436,"While we want to reconstruct the intervened latent variable, we also want to ensure that the changes,
the intervened latent variable makes in the corresponding generated data, are interpretable. This is
ensured by constraining the distribution of the generated data to lie strictly in the true data man-
ifold. Thus a particular generated datum differs from the training datum in a subset of factors of
variation, ideally in only one factor corresponding to the intervened latent variable. To address this,
we train the discriminator Dw to differentiate between the training data and the generated data. The
decoder weights are updated to generate data which would fool the discriminator. Thus the complete
objective function can be written as follows;"
OAT FACTOR DISENTANGLING,0.3487179487179487,"L2 = Ep(z)[Epθ(ˆxk|zk)[qφ(zk|ˆxk)] −βKL(pθ(ˆxk|zk)||q(x))]
(6)"
OAT FACTOR DISENTANGLING,0.35384615384615387,"The ﬁrst term in the above objective function minimizes the reconstruction error of the re-encoded,
intervened latent representation from the generated data. Because the intervened representations
are reconstructed from the generated data alone, the decoder is forced to make distinct changes in
the generated images corresponding to the different dimensions of z1. This ensures that the disen-
tangled set z1 is independently controllable and interpretable, a desirable property of disentangled
representations."
OAT FACTOR DISENTANGLING,0.358974358974359,"Since it is difﬁcult to compute analytically the high-dimensional true data distribution from the sam-
ples alone, the KL divergence in the second term is replaced with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JS-divergence). In Goodfellow et al. (2014) given an optimal discriminator network Dw, described
in Sec. 3.3, training the decoder to fool the discriminator essentially minimizes the JS-divergence
between the generated distribution and the training images."
OAT FACTOR DISENTANGLING,0.3641025641025641,"During the training, step 1 and step 2 are performed one after the other in an alternative fashion,
similar to other two-step learning algorithms such as wake-sleep (Hinton et al., 2006). This process"

latent dimension encodes information about multiple factors as long as one factor is only encoded

INTERPRETABILITY OF DISENTANGLED REPRESENTATIONS"
REFERENCES,0.7128205128205128,"To be of use for downstream tasks, successful transfer learning and domain adaptation (Bengio,
2013) or to glean insights from observers be them machines or humans, the representations must
somehow be interpretable. Interpretability has a simple intuitive understanding: that each factor
represents a human-deﬁned concept regarding the data, which humans could easily understand and
identify. In practice, however, this is only intuitive because these are concepts pre-trained in human
brains, and are not as clearly separable for machines without any imported biases; it is easy for
the network to fuse multiple of what appear to humans as “essential factors” into one latent code
while still keeping the factors independent and orthogonal to one another other; As an example, the
network simply can learn a rotation of the “human” representation, which would appear from an
observer to combine factors together. To address this, we deﬁne interpretability here in a new form
not as uniquely human interpretable persay but as interpretable latent representation manipulation:
each individual atomic code should make a unique and noticeable change in the output. Critically
we are not deﬁning noticable as being for humans only, as emphasized by the rotational example
above, but by any observer."

distribution log pθ(x|z). We use the negative cross entropy as the reconstruction loss and optimize
the model using the Adam optimiser (Kingma & Ba, 2017) with a learning rate of 1e −04 for the
dSprites dataset and 5e −05 for the 3D shapes dataset and the CelebA dataset."

LATENT TRAVERSALS"

Therefore we use latent traversals 4 as a way to measure disentanglement qualitatively (Che et al.,
2017). Disentanglement is evaluated qualitatively by traversing the latent space, by ﬁxing all the
dimensions of the representations except one and varying the values of that one dimension. For
the varying dimension discrete values are sampled over its distribution and the resulting generated
samples are visualized. A model has better disentanglement if for different values of the varying
dimension, the resulting generated samples have a distinct and noticeable change for an interpretable
factor of variation. We also qualitatively evaluate the models trained on dSprites and 3D shapes (ref:
