ABSTRACT,0.0029498525073746312,"In this paper, we focus on the problem of identifying bad training data when
the underlying cause is unknown in advance. Our key insight is that regardless
of how bad data are generated, they tend to contribute little to training a model
with good prediction performance or more generally, to some utility function of
the data analyst. We formulate the problem of good/bad data selection as utility
optimization. We propose a theoretical framework for evaluating the worst-case
performance of data selection heuristics. Remarkably, our results show that the
popular heuristic based on the Shapley value may choose the worst data subset in
certain practical scenarios, which sheds lights on its large performance variation
observed empirically in the past work. We then develop an algorithmic framework,
DATASIFTER, to detect a variety of and even unknown data issues—a step towards
general robustness to bad training data. DATASIFTER is guided by the theoretically
optimal solution to data selection and is made practical by the data utility learning
technique. Our evaluation shows that DATASIFTER achieves and most often
signiﬁcantly improves the state-of-the-art performance over a wide range of tasks,
including backdoor, poison, noisy/mislabel data detection, data summarization,
and data debiasing."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.008849557522123894,"The quality of training data is a fundamental ingredient towards useful and reliable ML-based
applications. Unfortunately, there are unaccountably many possible data issue types. For example,
errors and bias occur frequently in data generation and collection processes. Bad data could also
be caused by adversarial attacks (e.g., data poisoning and backdoor attacks), as training data are
often collected from anonymous and unveriﬁed sources. On the other hand, most of the existing data
selection strategies only applicable to speciﬁc data issues. Due to the diversity of data issues, there is
an urgent need to achieve general robustness to bad data of various types and even unknown types."
INTRODUCTION,0.011799410029498525,"Purging bad data is a long-standing problem, intensively studied by both the database and the ML
community. Most of the existing approaches, however, can only achieve specialized robustness to bad
data of certain types. In the database community, the state-of-the-art data cleaning approaches such as
ActiveClean (Krishnan et al., 2016), BoostClean (Krishnan et al., 2017), AlphaClean (Krishnan and
Wu, 2019), and CPClean (Karlaš et al., 2020) are only applicable to certain classes of ML models and
data issues. In particular, they cannot detect adversarial attacks on training data. The endeavors of the
ML community have covered a wider range of data quality issues such as adversarial attacks (Wang
et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019), data debiasing (Zemel et al., 2013; Madras et al., 2018), and mislabel
detection (Zhao et al., 2019). However, each aforementioned solution only focuses on addressing
a speciﬁc data issue effectively. The effectiveness of these approaches is based on the premise that
the data quality issues are known a priori, which usually does not hold in reality. Few recent works
have the potential to achieve general robustness to unknown data issues. One line of such works is
based on differentially private training (Du et al., 2019; Hong et al., 2020). These approaches do not
perform data selection; instead, they attempt to restrict the impact of each training data point on the
learning outcome in an undifferentiated manner. As a side effect, these approaches hinder learning
from good data, thereby leading to poor learning performance in practice (Tramèr and Boneh, 2020).
Another line of works that has potential to achieve general robustness is based on data valuation.
These works ﬁrst adopt a data importance metric, e.g., inﬂuence function (Koh and Liang, 2017;
Koh et al., 2019; Feldman and Zhang, 2020) or Shapley value (Ghorbani and Zou, 2019; Jia et al.,"

INTRODUCTION,0.017699115044247787,"2019a), to quantify each training data point’s contribution to the training process. Then, which data
to retain or remove is decided based on the ranking of data value. However, past empirical studies
(Jia et al., 2019b) and our experiments (Section 6) show that their performance varies considerably
across different data and learning algorithms. Overall, existing approaches to bad data ﬁltering either
cannot identify unknown data issues by design or suffer from poor detection efﬁcacy."
INTRODUCTION,0.02064896755162242,"In this work, we take a step towards general robustness to bad training data. Our work is underpinned
by a key insight about what deﬁnes “bad training data”. Despite the diverse types of data issues,
the crucial commonality is that all bad data contribute little to achieving good model performance.
If a data point contributes positively to learning, it would be beneﬁcial to just keep it as part of
the training set, thus not considered a “bad” point. Hence, a promising way to select data without
knowing data issue types in advance is to search for data subsets that results in the highest trained
model performance. More generally, the data analyst may have a utility function beyond model
performance, so we formulate data selection as a utility optimization problem (Section 3)."
INTRODUCTION,0.02359882005899705,"Secondly, with the utility optimization objective in mind, we present a novel theoretical framework
(Section 4) for rigorously analyzing the worst-case performance of data selection approaches. The
line of existing works closest to achieving general robustness is the aforementioned data value ranking
approaches. However, we show that these approaches have unsatisfying worst-case performance
guarantees due to failure to capture the interactions amongst selected data points (also empirically
shown in Appendix F.5.2). In particular, the popular Shapley value-based approach could select the
worst data in some common scenarios."
INTRODUCTION,0.02654867256637168,"We then design a general algorithmic framework guided by the theoretically optimal (but computa-
tionally infeasible) solution to utility optimization (Section 5). A signiﬁcant technical challenge for
ﬁnding the subset that optimize the model utility is that, in order to evaluate the impact of different
subsets of data on model performance, we need to retrain model on every possible subset. To solve
the computational challenge, we introduce DATASIFTER, which directly learns a parametric function
to predict the performance of a model trained on a given subset and then performs data selection
via optimizing the function. Compared with prior data selection algorithms, DATASIFTER has the
following advantages: (1) being able to handle various data issues (general robustness), (2) applies to
any target ML model architectures (model-agnostic), and (3) instantiated by the goal of downstream
ML tasks (task-driven). Finally, we conduct a thorough empirical study on a range of data issues
(Section 6), including backdoor and poisoning attack detection, noisy label/feature detection, data
summarization, and data debiasing. Our experiments demonstrate that DATASIFTER achieves and
most often signiﬁcantly improves the state-of-the-art performance of data valuation-based approaches."

RELATED WORK,0.032448377581120944,"Data valuation-based approaches can potentially achieve general robustness against diverse data
issues by quantifying data importance or “data value”, and then picking data points with high value
for model training process. One simple idea to quantify data importance is to use the leave-one-out
error. Koh and Liang (2017) provides an efﬁcient algorithm to approximate leave-one-out error for
each training point. Recent works leverage credit allocation schemes originated from cooperative
game theory to quantify data importance. Particularly, Shapley value has been widely used (Ghorbani
and Zou, 2019; Jia et al., 2019a;c;b; Wang et al., 2020), as it uniquely satisﬁes a set of desirable
axiomatic properties. More recently, Yan and Procaccia (2020) suggests that the Least core is also a
viable alternative to Shapley value for measuring data importance. However, computing the exact
Shapley and Least core values are generally NP-hard. Several approximation heuristics, such as
TMC-Shapley (Ghorbani and Zou, 2019), G-Shapley (Ghorbani and Zou, 2019), KNN-Shapley (Jia
et al., 2019c), have been proposed for the Shapley value. Despite their computational advantage, they
are biased in nature. On the other hand, unbiased estimators such as Permutation Sampling (Maleki,
2015) and Group Testing (Jia et al., 2019a) still require retraining models many times for any decent
approximation accuracy. TracIn (Pruthi et al., 2020) estimates the importance by tracing the test loss
change caused by a training example during the training process. The representer point method (Yeh
et al., 2018) captures the importance of training point by decomposing the pre-activation prediction
of a neural network into a linear combination of activations of training points."

WORST-CASE ANALYSIS FOR VALUATION-BASED APPROACHES,0.10619469026548672,"Our theoretical framework for studying the worst-case performance of data selection heuristics is
inspired by the domination analysis framework initially proposed in Glover and Punnen (1997). Our
worst-case performance metric is domination ratio, which measures how many subsets achieve lower
utility than the selected set in the worst-case scenario.
Deﬁnition 2 (Domination ratio). The domination ratio of a heuristic M for the data selection
problem is the maximum ratio 0 < d(n, k) ≤1 s.t., for every problem instance I = (D, U) on a
dataset D of size n and utility function U, M(I, k) produces a size-k subset S ⊆D which has utility

to ﬁrst learn a parametric model to approximate data utility functions. With such a model, one can
estimate the learning performance for any dataset by feeding the dataset at the input and query the
function’s output. Then, one can select the data subset by optimizing this model. If the model can

the number of utility samples
is 4000 for all the tasks we
evaluated on (an empirically
tuned number for efﬁciency-
performance tradeoff). Model
retraining could be computa-
tionally expensive for large
training datasets and models.
However, retraining on differ-
ent subsets is common and of-
ten unavoidable for data selec-
tions algorithms aiming at gen-
eral robustness, e.g., permuta-
tion sampling for Shapley value requires O(n log n) times model retraining. For DATASIFTER, two
techniques could be used to improve scalability. The ﬁrst technique is based on the observation that
4000 times of model retraining is still relatively efﬁcient on small datasets. For example, training
4000 small CNN models on the subsets of 2000 CIFAR-10 images takes only about 15 hours with
NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU. As long as different data subsets have observable differences in utilities
(e.g., 10% vs 30% test accuracy), the learned utility model can still be used to differentiate between
good and bad data points. Since the learned utility model can provide utility estimations for sets of
unseen data points by design, when the utility learning is on smaller subsets, greedy optimization
can still be performed on a larger dataset by selecting good data in a batch-mode style. This largely
improves the scalability of DATASIFTER (Appendix F.5.9). The second technique is to use a smaller
proxy model for utility sampling, which is proposed in Wang et al. (2021a), and the idea of using
proxy model for data selection was also explored in Lewis and Catlett (1994); Coleman et al. (2019).
This technique is based on the observation that the utilities of data for different learning algorithms
are usually positively correlated. In our experiment, we ﬁnd that sampling utilities on small subsets
can already achieve good efﬁciency and performance (Appendix F.5.9)."
DATASIFTER,0.1710914454277286,"Compared with prior data selection algorithms mentioned in Section 2, DATASIFTER has the following
advantages: (1) achieves general robustness by design, (2) is model-agnostic as data utility function

function). In addition, with the learned data utility model, DATASIFTER can provide an estimate of
the utility for the selected dataset, which will be useful for data analysts to decide the number of data
points to select. The major differences between DATASIFTER and previous data selection algorithms

IMPORTANT SETTINGS AND BASELINES"
IMPORTANT SETTINGS AND BASELINES,0.19469026548672566,"For fair comparison between DATASIFTER and baselines, we ﬁx the number of utility sampling as
4000 for DATASIFTER as well as baseline algorithms that require utility sampling. For DATASIFTER,
subsets are sampled by ﬁrst picking a set size uniformly, and then uniformly sample a subset of the
given size. The validation data in utility sampling are 500 clean data points sampled from the test
data of the corresponding datasets. We repeat model training ten times for each selected set of data
points to obtain the error bars. The metric function we use for Data Debiasing experiment is weighted
accuracy, and for all other experiments the metric function is validation accuracy. Both DATASIFTER
and baselines use the same metric function."
IMPORTANT SETTINGS AND BASELINES,0.1976401179941003,"We focus on comparing data valuation-based approaches as they are closest to achieving general
robustness. Differentially private training methods are omitted from comparison as they signiﬁcantly
impair model performance. Data cleaning methods are also omitted as their applicability is limited to
speciﬁc data types, error types, and model architectures. We consider the following eight state-of-art
data valuation-based approaches: (1) Shapley Permutation Sampling (Perm-SV) (Maleki, 2015), a
Monte Carlo-based algorithm for Shapley value estimation. (2) TMC-Shapley (TMC-SV) (Ghorbani
and Zou, 2019), a reﬁned version of the Perm-SV, where the computation focuses on the subsets
whose utility changes signiﬁcantly when an extra point is added. (3) G-Shapley (G-SV) (Ghorbani
and Zou, 2019), which approximates the Shapley value by anticipating the utility change caused by
an extra point with its gradient. (4) KNN-Shapley (KNN-SV) (Jia et al., 2019c), which approximates
the Shapley value by using K-Nearest-Neighbor as a proxy model. (5) Least Core (LC) (Yan and
Procaccia, 2020), another data value notion in cooperative game theory with Monte Carlo-based
approximation. (6) Leave-one-out (LOO) (Ghorbani and Zou, 2019) evaluates the change of model
performance when a data point is removed. (7) Inﬂuence Function (INF) (Koh and Liang, 2017; Koh
et al., 2019), which approximates the LOO error with ﬁrst-order extrapolation. (8) TracIn-Clean
(Pruthi et al., 2020), which traces the loss on clean validation data change during the training process
whenever the training point of interest is sampled in batch SGD. (9) TracIn-Self (Pruthi et al., 2020)
use the similar technique as TracIn-Clean but traces the self-inﬂuence, i.e., the reduction of a training
point on its own loss. This approach is used for detecting bad data. (10) Random is a setting where
we randomly select a subset from the target dataset."

FILTERING OUT HARMFUL DATA,0.2182890855457227,"I. Backdoor Detection. Backdoor attacks (Gu et al., 2017) embed an exploit at training time that is
subsequently invoked by the presence of a “trigger” at test time. They are considered particularly
dangerous since they make victim models predict a target output on inputs with predeﬁned triggers
while still retain high accuracy on clean data. Since data points with the backdoor triggers contribute
little or negatively to the learning of clean test data, they are expected not to be not included in the
subset that optimizes objective (1). This experiment studies the effectiveness of DATASIFTER for
removing backdoored examples. We evaluate Trojan attack (Liu et al., 2017) here. We adopted a
three-layer CNN as the target model, a poison rate of 0.05, and a target label ‘Airplane’. Figure 2 I.(a)
and I.(b) elaborate the Trojan attack detection results for a 2,000-size randomly selected subset of
the CIFAR-10 dataset. As we can see, DATASIFTER signiﬁcantly outperforms other approaches; for
instance, it achieves a detection rate of 90% with 46% fewer inspected data points than the others."
FILTERING OUT HARMFUL DATA,0.22123893805309736,"II. Poisoned Data Detection. In data poisoning attacks, adversaries make slight modiﬁcations
to some training samples to cause misclassiﬁcation on target test samples. We evaluate different
techniques on feature collision attack (Shafahi et al., 2018) and inﬂuence function-based attack (Koh
and Liang, 2017). They are clean-label attacks where the attacker does not need to control the labeling
of poisoned data. Figure 2 II.(a) and II.(b) show the results for feature collision attack (Shafahi et al.,
2018) on a 500-size randomly selected CIFAR-10 subset, where 50 data points of class ‘cat’ are
perturbed with features extracted from a ‘frog’ sample in the test set. We see that DATASIFTER
signiﬁcantly outperforms all other methods in the poisoned data detection task; for instance, it attains
a 90% detection rate with 66% fewer examined data points."
FILTERING OUT HARMFUL DATA,0.22418879056047197,"III. Noisy Feature Detection. Noise in features originated from sampling or transmitting (e.g.,
Gaussian noise) may decrease classiﬁcation accuracy. Following the settings in Wang et al. (2021a),
we add white noise to clean samples, and we evaluate the performance of each technique on detecting
those samples. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, we corrupt 25% of the training data images by adding white
noise. Based on Figure 2 III.(a) and III.(b), we conclude that DATASIFTER signiﬁcantly outperforms
all other methods on this task; for example, it achieves a 90% of detection rate by examining 67.25%
fewer data points. Meanwhile, the KNN-SV approach exhibits a distinctive trend – it only starts
ﬁnding the noisy data points until ﬁltering out a certain amount of clean data. This is mainly because
all noisy data points are out-of-distribution (OOD). A more detailed discussion is in the Appendix."

FILTERING OUT HARMFUL DATA,0.23008849557522124,"IV. Mislabeling Detection. Following Ghorbani and Zou (2019), we perform experiments on two
datasets and present the results of SVM trained on Enron1 SPAM dataset (Shams and Mercer, 2013).
We adopt a bag-of-words representation for training. The noise ﬂipping ratio is 15%. Under this
setting, inﬂuence-based techniques and G-SV are not applicable since they require the model trained
with gradient-based approaches. Figure 2 IV.(a) show that DATASIFTER does not attain the highest
detection rate. This is because for SPAM dataset, the margin between the two classes is large
so a small amount of mislabeled samples do not signiﬁcantly affect model performance; hence,
those mislabeled samples could evade detection based on the validation performance. Such evasion
is acceptable as the model trained over the data points selected by DATASIFTER still achieves a
competitive accuracy (as shown in Figure 2 IV.(b)). On the other hand, KNN-SV and LOO can
accomplish a good detection rate but end up with a lower model performance. This is because they
select very unbalanced samples, as both of them satisfy the symmetry axiom discussed in Section 4."

We explore
whether techniques can help select a sub-

use logistic regression trained on the UCI Adult Census dataset as the task model. We measure the
fairness by weighted accuracy – the average of model classiﬁcation accuracy over females and that
over males. G-SV, KNN-SV, and Inﬂuence-based techniques are not applicable for this application
since they are designed for computing data importance when the metric is test accuracy or loss.
Figure 3 VI shows that DATASIFTER achieves the top-tire performance along with the Perm-SV. We
note that for this particular task, one can potentially further improve DATASIFTER’s performance by
changing the subset sampling distribution with more variation in the ratio of sensitive attributes, e.g.,
gender in Adult dataset. Here, we stick with the uniform subset sampling as other tasks since we
intend to evaluate general robustness instead of targeting on one speciﬁc data issue type."

through some efﬁcient approximation of data utility functions would be interesting future works."

STOCHASTIC GREEDY ALGORITHM"
REFERENCES,0.6814159292035398,"For completeness, we brieﬂy introduce the stochastic greedy algorithm (SG) for submodular
optimization from Mirzasoleiman et al. (2015) here. The stochastic greedy algorithm is a simple
approach that, for each iteration, randomly selects a subset of data and then ﬁnds the best data point
within that subset. In the context of optimizing utility model (i.e., the trained DeepSets model), the
“best data point” within each randomly selected subset refers to the data point z with the highest
marginal contribution ˆU(S ∪{z}) −ˆU(S), where S is the set of data points selected in previous
iterations. The pseudo-code is outlined in Algorithm 1. The distinction between this approach
and the vanilla greedy algorithm is that the candidate data points to be selected in each iteration
of stochastic greedy algorithm is a smaller, randomly selected subset instead of all unselected data
points. Thus, this approach is more efﬁcient than vanilla greedy optimization and the runtime is
linear in the number of dataset size to achieve 1 −1/e −ϵ optimization guarantee for monotone
submodular functions (ϵ is the precision parameter used in Algorithm 1). Although its approximation
guarantee has been proved only for monotone submodular objective functions, previous work (Wang
et al., 2021a) as well as our experiments show that it also achieve high empirical performance on data
utility functions that are approximately submodular, therefore we use this algorithm for optimizing
data utility models. Exploring different approaches for optimizing data utility models are interesting
future directions."

CHARACTERIZATION AND LEARNABILITY OF DATA UTILITY FUNCTIONS"
RETURN S,0.7168141592920354,"Approximate Submodularity and Data Utility Functions.
It has been empirically observed in
prior works (Wang et al., 2021a) that the data utility functions of many commonly used learning
algorithms exhibits approximate submodularity property. Submodular functions are almost always
being characterized by the “diminishing return” property. Formally, a set function f : 2V →R
returning a real value for any subset S ⊆V is submodular if f({j} ∪S) −f(S) ≥f({j} ∪T) −
f(T), ∀S ⊆T, j ∈V \ T. Figure 4 shows some examples of the marginal contributions of a ﬁxed
data point versus the sizes of a sequence of data subsets. We can see a clear “diminishing returns”
phenomenon from the ﬁgure. That is, an extra training data point contributes less to model accuracy
as the base training set size increases."

RETURN S,0.7345132743362832,"contributions of an additional data point to the datasets have larger variance. Hence, when two data
sets get more different in sizes, the contributions to two sets might deviate more from the exact
submodularity property. When β = 0, this condition reduces to exact submodularity deﬁnition.
However, this relaxation is mainly developed based on empirical experiments as well as mathematical
convenience. There are no theoretical analysis for the correctness of the above characterization.
Although the (approximate) submodularity seems very plausible and intuitive for commonly used
data utility functions, the rigorous theoretical analysis is surprisingly hard. Submodularity has thus
far been proved for only two simple classes of classiﬁers–Naive Bayes and Nearest Neighbors (Wei
et al., 2015). The rigorous proof of the approximate submodularity of more widely used models such
as logistic regression and deep nets seem to be important future works."

In Section 4, our
only assumption of data utility functions is submodularity. Of course, analyzing more restrictive
function classes can give tighter results. In fact, a tight analysis of data utility function is possible for
simple models (e.g., see the derivation for KNN and Naive Bayes in Wei et al. (2015)). Such analysis
seems to be intractable for more complicated models such as deep neural networks. Hence, in Section
4, we tried to ﬁnd the most restrictive function classes for describing data utility functions without

GENERALIZATION OF DATA UTILITY LEARNING"

a 50-dimensional Gaussian distribution, where the covariance matrix is identity matrix and the 50
mean parameters are sampled uniformly from [−1, 1]. Each data point is labeled by the sign of the
sum of the data point vector. Since logistic regression problem is convex and has unique global
minimum, the data utility has smaller variance due to the randomness in learning algorithm and thus
utility prediction is relatively accurate. For Figure 5 (b), the data utility function is the validation
accuracy of a CNN model trained on a subset of CIFAR-10 dataset of size 2000. Since learning
neural networks is a non-convex problem, the variance in data utility from the optimization process
is relatively large, the utility prediction error is also relatively large. However, we can still need a
strongly positive correlation between the predicted and true data utility, which means that the data
utility model is still able to differentiate between subsets with large utility gaps."

RETURN S,0.9882005899705014,"When executed on NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU, the clock time for the utility sampling step is within 15
hours for 4000 utility samples with a small CNN model, as the data size is fairly small. The LOO,
the Least core, and all the Shapley value-based approaches except KNN-SV did not terminate in
24 hours, so we remove them from comparison. As we can see from Figure 10, DATASIFTER once
again outperforms all the remaining approaches. The results show that the learned utility model can
provide utility estimations for sets of unseen data points, which largely improves the scalability of
DATASIFTER. On the contrary, the existing valuation-based approaches cannot predict the importance
of unseen data points. Thus their utility sampling has to be conducted over the entire dataset."
RETURN S,0.9911504424778761,"Follow the same method in Algorithm 2, we perform noisy data detection on a 20,000-size CIFAR-10
dataset. The corruption ratio is 25%. Again, for DATASIFTER, we train the utility model on utility
samples collected from retraining on subsets of 1000 data points (5% of 20,000). We remove the
LOO, the Least core, and all the Shapley value-based approaches except KNN-SV from comparison,
as they did not terminate in 24 hours for 4000 utility sampling on the 20,000-size set. As we can
see from Figure 11 (a) and (b), DATASIFTER signiﬁcantly outperforms all other baseline techniques
except TracIn-Clean. However, TracIn-Clean only starts ﬁnding bad data after ﬁltering out certain
clean data points. The results demonstrate that although the utility sampling step could be expensive,
the scalability of DATASIFTER can be boosted by the predictive power of the learned utility model."
