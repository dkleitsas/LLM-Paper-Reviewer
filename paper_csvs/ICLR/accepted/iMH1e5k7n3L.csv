ABSTRACT,0.0051813471502590676,"Biological spiking neural networks (SNNs) can temporally encode information
in their outputs, e.g. in the rank order in which neurons ﬁre, whereas artiﬁcial
neural networks (ANNs) conventionally do not. As a result, models of SNNs
for neuromorphic computing are regarded as potentially more rapid and efﬁcient
than ANNs when dealing with temporal input. On the other hand, ANNs are
simpler to train, and usually achieve superior performance. Here we show that
temporal coding such as rank coding (RC) inspired by SNNs can also be applied
to conventional ANNs such as LSTMs, and leads to computational savings and
speedups. In our RC for ANNs, we apply backpropagation through time using the
standard real-valued activations, but only from a strategically early time step of
each sequential input example, decided by a threshold-crossing event. Learning
then incorporates naturally also when to produce an output, without other changes
to the model or the algorithm. Both the forward and the backward training pass
can be signiﬁcantly shortened by skipping the remaining input sequence after that
ﬁrst event. RC-training also signiﬁcantly reduces time-to-insight during infer-
ence, with a minimal decrease in accuracy. The desired speed-accuracy trade-off
is tunable by varying the threshold or a regularization parameter that rewards out-
put entropy. We demonstrate these in two toy problems of sequence classiﬁca-
tion, and in a temporally-encoded MNIST dataset where our RC model achieves
99.19% accuracy after the ﬁrst input time-step, outperforming the state of the art
in temporal coding with SNNs, as well as in spoken-word classiﬁcation of Google
Speech Commands, outperforming non-RC-trained early inference with LSTMs."

INTRODUCTION,0.015544041450777202,"Neuromorphic computing is the study and use of computational mechanisms of biological neural
networks in mathematical models, software simulations, and hardware emulations, both as a tool
for neuroscience, and as a possible path towards improved machine intelligence (Indiveri, 2021).
In fact, much of the recent progress in machine learning (ML) is attributed to artiﬁcial neural net-
works (ANNs), which share certain characteristics with biological neural networks. These biological
analogies of ANN models include a connectionist graph-like structure (Rosenblatt, 1958), parallel
computing over multiple synaptic weights and neurons (Indiveri & Horiuchi, 2011), and the non-
von Neumann collocation of memory and processing at each synapse and neuron (Sebastian et al.,
2020). On the other hand, state-of-the-art (SOTA) ANNs for ML often miss several other neuromor-
phic mechanisms that are fundamental in biological neural systems. A characteristic example is that
of “spikes”, i.e. the short stereotypical pulses that biological neurons emit to communicate (Maass,
1997; Ponulak & Kasinski, 2011). This is a principal neuromorphic feature, characterizing the"

INTRODUCTION,0.031088082901554404,"brain and a category of bio-plausible models known as spiking neural networks (SNNs), but not the
most successful ANNs, suggesting unexploited potential and limited understanding of spike-based
approaches. Despite the stereotypical, unmodulated shape of spikes, spiking neurons can encode
continuous values, for example in their average ﬁring rate (Brette, 2015), which is abstracted into
the continuous activation of conventional artiﬁcial neurons (Pfeiffer & Pfeil, 2018). Perhaps more
interestingly, spikes can also carry information in their speciﬁc timing, i.e. through temporal coding
that modulates when spikes are ﬁred (Brette, 2015). Partly because individual spikes can encode in-
formation sparsely and rapidly, biological nervous systems and spiking neuromorphic systems can
be extremely energy-efﬁcient and fast in the processing of their input stimuli (Qiao et al., 2015;
Davies et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2021; Yin et al., 2021). This efﬁciency and speed are key motiva-
tions for much of the research on SNNs for potential applications in ML and inference. Moreover,
owing to neuronal and synaptic dynamics, SNNs are more powerful computational models than cer-
tain ANNs in theory (Maass, 1997; Moraitis et al., 2020). In practice, SNNs have recently surpassed
conventional ANNs in accuracy in particular ML tasks, by virtue of short-term synaptic plasticity
(Leng et al., 2018; Moraitis et al., 2020). Spike coding itself can also add computational power
to SNNs by increasing the dimensionality of neuronal responses (Izhikevich, 2006; Moraitis et al.,
2018). However, in practical ML terms, ﬁrstly, spike coding poses difﬁculties to precise modelling
and training that require ad hoc mitigation (Mostafa, 2017; Pauli et al., 2018; Pfeiffer & Pfeil, 2018;
Wo´zniak et al., 2020; Coms¸a et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). Secondly, SNNs are particularly
difﬁcult to analyse mathematically and rigorous ML-theoretic spiking models are scarce (Nessler
et al., 2013; Moraitis et al., 2020). Thirdly, they require unconventional neuronal models, which do
not fully beneﬁt from the mature theoretical and practical toolbox of conventional ANNs (Bellec
et al., 2018; Wo´zniak et al., 2020; Coms¸a et al., 2021). As a result, the efﬁciency and speed ben-
eﬁts of temporal coding for ML have been hard to demonstrate with SOTA accuracy in real-world
tasks. For instance, very recent literature on temporal coding with SNNs (Coms¸a et al., 2021; Zhang
et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021; Mirsadeghi et al., 2021; G¨oltz et al., 2021) uses rank coding (RC),
i.e. the temporal scheme where the ﬁrst output neuron to spike encodes the network’s inferred label
(Thorpe & Gautrais, 1998), and it applies it to speed up inference on tasks such as hand-written
digit (MNIST) (Lecun et al., 1998) recognition. However, when applied (Zhou et al., 2021) to more
difﬁcult datasets such as Imagenet (Deng et al., 2009), the accuracy is signiﬁcantly lower than in
non-spiking versions of the same network (Szegedy et al., 2015). Moreover, in these demonstrations
there are no directly measured beneﬁts compared to non-spiking ANNs."
INTRODUCTION,0.03626943005181347,"Even though temporal coding is usually not described in terms comparable with non-spiking ANNs,
there are in fact ANN architectures with certain analogies to RC, when viewed from a particular an-
gle. Namely, in an SNN that receives a sequence example of several input steps, e.g. in a sequence-
classiﬁcation task, one implication of RC is that the computation for each sequence example can be
halted after the ﬁrst output neuron has spiked and produced an inferred label, even if several steps of
the input sequence still remain unseen. Therefore, this is an adaptive type of processing that dynam-
ically chooses the time and computation to be dedicated to each sequence. From this perspective,
RC is related to ANN techniques such as Self-Delimiting Neural Networks (Schmidhuber, 2012),
Adaptive Computation Time (Graves, 2016), and PonderNet (Banino et al., 2021), which are also
concerned with when computation should halt. However, these methods do not aim to adaptively
reduce the processed length of an input sequence as RC does, but rather to adaptively add time-
steps of processing to each step of the input sequence. A possibly more deeply related method is
that of adaptive early-exit inference (Laskaridis et al., 2021). In this case, the forward propagation
of an input throughout layers in a deep neural network at inference time is forwarded from an early
layer directly to a classiﬁer head, skipping the layers that remain higher in the hierarchy, if that
early layer crosses a conﬁdence threshold. In certain cases, early exit has been applied to sequence
classiﬁcation with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where the threshold-crossing dictates when in
the sequence of an input example the network should output its inference, saving indeed in terms
of time and computation (Dennis et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2021). This timing decision based on the
ﬁrst cross of a threshold is similar to inference with RC. However, these early-exit models were not
speciﬁcally trained to learn a rank code. It is conceivable that this mismatch between training and
inference is suboptimal. In addition, this non-RC training of early-exit inference models does not
apply the computational savings and speed beneﬁts also to the training process."
INTRODUCTION,0.04145077720207254,"Taking together the limitations and beneﬁts of SNNs and of other approaches, what is needed is a
strategy that introduces aspects of RC into conventional, non-spiking ANNs, including during train-
ing. This would potentially reap the speed and efﬁciency beneﬁts of this neuromorphic scheme,"

INTRODUCTION,0.05181347150259067,"without abandoning the real-world usability and performance of ANNs. In addition, these insights
into neural coding could feed back to neuroscience. Here we describe and demonstrate such a strat-
egy for temporal coding in deep learning and inference with ANNs. The general concept is simple.
Namely, even though ANN activations are continuous-valued and therefore neurons do not have to
rely on time to encode information as in SNNs, ANNs too could time their outputs and, importantly,
they could learn to do so. To achieve this in an RNN such as long short-term memory (LSTM)
(Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), we back-propagate through time (BPTT) from a strategic and
early time step in each training example’s sequence. The time step is decided by the rank-one, i.e.
ﬁrst, output neuron activation to cross a threshold. As a result of this Rank Coding (RC) during
training, the network learns not only to minimize the loss, but implicitly also to optimize its outputs’
timing, reducing time to insight as well as computational demands of training and inference. In
our experiments, we provide several demonstrations, with advantages compared to SNNs from the
literature as well as compared to conventional ANNs, including in MNIST classiﬁcation and speech
recognition. Moreover, we show that our method could be applied to SNNs directly as well."

DEEP LEARNING OF RANK CODING,0.07253886010362694,"Algorithm 1 shows the RC-training process. The network decides the rank-one spike timing tsp of
its outputs based on its output-layer activations and a threshold θ (line 10). The loss function can
be a common on such as cross-entropy. There is no explicit parametrization on time, and only one
instantaneous output ˆyit is used in the loss (line 12). Therefore, RC-training does not explicitly
optimize the timing tsp of the network’s outputs. Thus, it is not obvious that learning of the tim-
ing aspect can emerge. Nevertheless, timing is implicitly, albeit indeed optimized, as seen in what
follows. With random initialization, the activations are nearly uniformly distributed across output
neurons, and are smaller than the threshold, throughout the sequence. Without an earlier cross of
a threshold, the algorithm applies BPTT from the last step of the sequence (line 4: tsp = T). As
training advances, minimizing the error between the outputs and the labels minimizes the entropy
of the output distribution, i.e. causes the activations at the end of each sequence example to be con-
centrated around one of the output neurons, such that the maximum activation ˆymax
tsp
is maximized.
Through BPTT from that last time step, credit is assigned to earlier time steps as well. Progressively
through training, this causes outputs to cross the threshold earlier and earlier, under the condition
that relevant, credit-assigned input signal does exist earlier. This conditional acceleration causes the
optimization of output timing. This is also shown mathematically in Appendix A."

DEEP LEARNING OF RANK CODING,0.09326424870466321,"RC-inference after RC-training is similar to Algorithm 1 but the backward pass (line 12) is not
applied. It should be noted that the inference stage on its own performed in this manner, where a
threshold decides the timing of the output, is a version of what has been called early exit or early
inference. In our implementation, the expectation is that the model learns to encode information in
the rank order of its output’s timing, because that timing is integrated into the learning process. In
this sense, at inference, the model does not merely exit early, but it does so through an underlying
learned rank code (RC). Our experimental demonstrations conﬁrmed that the loss is minimized
through RC-training, although BPTT’s application time-step varies between training examples, and
that timing is also minimized down to an optimal ﬂoor, as the conditional arguments above (and Eq.
8 in the Appendix) predict."

we could perform inference conventionally, at the end of the sequence. However, attempting to
perform early, i.e. RC, inference in a manner similar to the RC-trained model is problematic in this
case. The ﬁrst output spike is always negative (red) regardless of the true class, therefore the ﬁrst
spike label cannot be used (Fig. 1F). Label prediction in this case can be improved by a scheme
where examples are considered negative unless a positive (blue) spike is output, whereas negative
(red) spikes are ignored. In terms of timing, the ﬁrst positive spikes are in fact emitted soon relative
to the observation of a ﬁve-step subsequence, but still one step too late (Fig. 1F, bottom-most blue
spikes). Moreover, through this scheme, inference of negative labels cannot be performed before the
full 25 steps of an input sequence are all observed. Therefore, RC training is necessary for fastest
inference, for less computation, and for sparseness of output spikes. To gain deeper insight into
the RC-trained network, we also study its activations before the application of the threshold and
compare with the conventionally-trained model (Fig. 1D & G). Interestingly, the RC model ﬂexibly
adapts its belief throughout each input sequence based on available evidence. In contrast, the non-
RC model begins early on in the 25 steps to believe inputs as negative examples, and does not show
signs of rapid adaptation to the changing input evidence. This by-default negative (red) belief, and
the slow switching of opinion cause comparatively low conﬁdence when the 5-step sequences are
present (Fig. 1G, light blue). Furthermore, the sparsity that we observed in terms of output spikes of
the RC model is observable also at the pre-spike activations. Both positive and negative activations
remain low (light colours in Fig. 1F) until enough evidence appears. In summary, RC-training
solved both the classiﬁcation and the timing aspects of this task, while it also introduced sparsity in
the network’s activity, and it reduced the computational steps in training and inference."

et al. (1994) and adapted by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997). The task is to classify input se-
quences into one of two classes. Each example of the positive class is a sequence of 40 independent
samples from a Gaussian distribution centred at +0.05, whereas the negative class is centred at -0.05
(Fig. 2A). Each sequence has a constant standard deviation sampled uniformly from the range (0.05,
0.25). These sequential inputs provide progressively more evidence on the underlying mean value,
which is difﬁcult or impossible to infer correctly from a short sequence when the noise is high. Here
as well, we trained an LSTM model conventionally i.e. by back-propagating from the last time step
of each sequence, and compared to our RC-training approach. The RC-trained model, evaluated on
a test set at the time of its ﬁrst spike, i.e. with RC-inference, achieved an accuracy of 95.45%. This
is lower than the 96.84% reached by the non-RC-trained model, when evaluated at the last, i.e. 40th,
time-step. However, the RC-trained model produced its RC-inference early, after 14 time-steps on
average. The accuracy of the non-RC-trained model, if evaluated at the 14th time-step, is much
lower (89%). Alternatively, we also tested the non-RC-trained model with RC-inference, and the
model achieved a higher accuracy of 96.32%. However, it was signiﬁcantly slower than the RC-
trained model, with an average ﬁrst spike after 23 time-steps. If we examine the distribution of the
ﬁrst spike time as it changes throughout training, it can be seen that the RC-trained model becomes
signiﬁcantly faster progressively (Fig. 2B, blue), which conﬁrms experimentally our theoretical
result (Eq. 8) that RC-training optimizes timing. Conversely, when the non-RC-trained model is
evaluated with RC-inference throughout its training, it shows that conventional training has little
effect on the timing distribution. In this task, therefore, the RC-trained model achieves faster infer-
ence, by optimizing timing, albeit at the expense of accuracy. As we have introduced in the paper’s
theoretical section, it is theoretically possible to use a regularization that prevents over-optimization
of timing at any cost. We demonstrate this in the following more challenging tasks."

SNN BENCHMARKS ON TEMPORAL MNIST,0.31088082901554404,"The MNIST dataset is a common image-recognition benchmark. It includes grey-scale images of
handwritten digits, where each pixel is an intensity value between 0 and 255. The task of classifying
such digits into 10 classes is considered rather simple by modern ML standards. However, more
complex versions have been designed to match and demonstrate the temporal capabilities of SNNs,
and contrast them to ANNs, by encoding the input temporally. In a common such version (Coms¸a
et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021; Mirsadeghi et al., 2021), each input pixel’s
intensity is encoded by the timing of a single and binary spike in a time interval, where darker pixels
spike earlier. Some SNNs operate in continuous time, but here we use discrete time, and we encode
each MNIST frame over 10 time steps (Fig. 3A). Some of the recent SNN work has demonstrated
that temporally coded SNNs can perform the task earlier than the end of each input sequence (Coms¸a
et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). Of particular background interest is a ﬁnding in Coms¸a et al. (2021).
Speciﬁcally, temporal coding has two possible regimes when performing this task. One regime is
relatively slow but more accurate. The other is a faster but less accurate regime, where on average
less than 15% of the input frame’s duration has passed before inference. As a result, in this task, for
each reported accuracy, the regime of speed must be speciﬁed, as is indeed in Coms¸a et al. (2021). A
different, very recent work reports results outperforming those of Coms¸a et al. (2021), but does not
mention the presence of two regimes. It does show histograms of inference time, where it appears
that the model is not in the fast regime, and it mentions a training time in the order of 100 epochs, at
which point Coms¸a et al. (2021) described that the network is at a high accuracy-low speed regime.
Here, we RC-trained an LSTM and a convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) (Xingjian et al., 2015).
Firstly, the RC models did learn to perform inference in a very fast regime, on average immediately
after the very ﬁrst input time-step (Fig. 3B). Next, we conﬁrmed that our theoretical method of
balancing the speed-accuracy trade-off, through an entropy-rewarding regularization term weighted
by β, is effective. By using a higher β during RC-training, the networks remained in a slower but
more accurate regime. By switching to a lower β value during training, the model switched to the
faster but slightly less accurate regime. Therefore, this validates the intended functionality of our
regularization term, and also conﬁrms the presence of the two discrete regimes in this task (Fig.
3C). These were observed in every network that we trained, and Fig. 3 B & C shows these effects in
one of the models, namely a hidden layer of 20 ConvLSTM units, all-to-all connected to 10 output
neurons with a softmax. The speed-up is attributable to RC-training (see Appendix B.3). Our models
outperformed the SOTA SNNs in both the fast and the slow regime, except much larger and deeper
SNNs that slightly outperformed ours. Our models and their accuracies compared to the literature
are presented in Table 1. In addition, we could achieve high accuracy in the fast regime within
only 50 epochs (Fig. 3B), while the existing SOTA in the fast regime required several hundreds of
training epochs (Coms¸a et al., 2021)). For all results, we used Adam with a learning rate ﬁxed at
0.001, and the threshold of 0.95. The only hyperparameter value that we searched systematically
was β. These results are noteworthy because they achieve and surpass some of the advantages of
SNNs by using a spike-based technique, but avoiding the main difﬁculties of SNNs. Moreover, RC
enables a novel reduction of the resource requirements. Speciﬁcally, it reduces the computation per
training example or batch, as RC only backpropagates from the ﬁrst output spike. In contrast, even
in the temporal coding SNN literature, all output neurons spike before backpropagation is applied.
Notably, our new RC method is applicable to SNNs (Appendix E)."

RAPID KEYWORD CLASSIFICATION - GOOGLE SPEECH COMMANDS,0.34196891191709844,"The last and most advanced task that we addressed is a form of speech recognition. Speciﬁcally,
we used the Google Speech Commands dataset v0.02 (Warden, 2018). This is a popular dataset
containing 105,829 utterances of 35 different spoken terms from 2,618 speakers, and each of these
recorded segments is at most 1-second long. 10 of the spoken terms (“Yes”, “No”, “Up”, “Down”,
“Left”, “Right”, “On”, “Off”, “Stop” and “Go”) are selected as keywords, whereas the remaining
25 terms are combined into an 11th, “unknown” class. We applied a preprocessing that is standard
for this type of task, generating log-mel ﬁlterbank energies to extract constituent frequencies of the
recording, and a moving window. This resulted in 20 frequency-features over a sequence of 81
frames. We used a network with 128 LSTM units before two fully connected layers of 32 and 11
neurons each, with a softmax at the output. The training, validation and testing split of the dataset
followed the convention provided in section 7 of Warden (2018). We trained the model with RC,
examining whether RC is effective in this task too, and then we compared to a baseline early infer-
ence after conventional training with BPTT from the end of each training sequence-example. First,"

RAPID KEYWORD CLASSIFICATION - GOOGLE SPEECH COMMANDS,0.39378238341968913,"evaluated using RC-inference with the same spiking threshold (0.95) as was used for RC-training
(Fig. 4A and C). In parallel, we recorded the mean time-to-inference on the validation set, as de-
ﬁned by the ﬁrst output spike time. In one case we used standard cross-entropy loss, i.e. with the
conﬁdence-regularization term β set to zero. We observe that, in this case, spike time is signiﬁcantly
reduced by RC-training, down to less than 500 ms on average, compared to the 1000 ms of the full
speech sequences (Fig. 4C lightest blue curve). In fact, training continues to minimize the spike
time. However, the validation accuracy (Fig. 4A, lightest blue) also decreases with training. This is
another expression of the effect that we observed in previous tasks, where continued minimization
of the timing trades off accuracy. To resolve that, we introduce a non-zero β regularization term,
which achieves its goal to balance timing minimization against loss minimization. Speciﬁcally, a
β ≤0.3 increases the RC-inference validation accuracy compared to β = 0. However, it keeps
the mean spike time delayed until the end of the sequence (Fig. 4A & C, darkest blue). An inter-
mediate value of β = 0.2 (medium-light blue curve) achieves a much better trade-off, where the
validation accuracy is almost identical to the one achieved by β = 0.4, but validation inference
speed is signiﬁcantly higher, with a stably converged spike time of around 600 ms. As a ﬁrst base-
line, we compare these validation accuracies and speeds to a model trained with backpropagation
from the last time-step of each sequence and without our regularization (i.e. β = 0). This non-RC-
trained model, validated using RC-inference, reached a maximum accuracy that was lower than the
accuracy of the best RC-trained models, and subsequently deteriorated fast (Fig. 4A, light green).
Importantly, even when evaluated, not on RC spiking early inference, but on conventional end-of-
sequence inference, its validation accuracy (Fig. 4A, red curve) is not signiﬁcantly higher than the
RC-trained RC-inference – the curve is rather indistinguishable. This suggests that RC-training
optimizes accuracy comparatively well, despite also focusing on the timing. We will quantify this
comparison to non-RC training and make it conclusive on the test set, but ﬁrst we will further anal-
yse the non-RC training process. As the best validation performance of the RC-trained models was
achieved by incorporating a non-zero conﬁdence-regularization term β, we explored whether it is
this regularization, rather than the RC-training itself, that is responsible for the seeming timing ad-
vantage of the RC-trained model. Speciﬁcally, we trained with conventional backpropagation from
the end of each sequence using cross-entropy but now added regularization to the loss function by
β ∈{0.2, 0.3, 0.4}, in addition to β = 0 as mentioned before. We performed threshold-based early
inference on the validation set throughout training, using the same conﬁdence threshold (0.95) as
for the RC-trained models. Different thresholds were explored in the analysis we describe later. The
resulting accuracy and speed curves are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that values of increasing
β improves the convergence of the validation accuracy (Fig. 4B). However, to converge to a stable
level of accuracy, a β > 0.3 is required, which comes at a signiﬁcant cost of speed. Therefore, β
regularization alone does not sufﬁce to obtain the beneﬁts of RC-training."
RAPID KEYWORD CLASSIFICATION - GOOGLE SPEECH COMMANDS,0.39896373056994816,"Ultimately, most interesting in such an application is the quality of the resulting trade-off between
speed and accuracy on the test dataset. In addition, the tunability of this trade-off is important. It is
indeed possible to tune this trade-off by varying the threshold of the trained model, thus obtaining
a varying accuracy as a function of inference time, i.e. spike time. This is an existing approach
in the literature (Sun et al., 2016; Dennis et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2021). By lowering the threshold,
faster inference is obtained for a cost of lower accuracy. As a result, for each trained model, the curve
representing the trade-off and its tunability is the curve of accuracy as a function of mean spike time.
This curve, for the case of the non-RC trained models, is shown in Fig. 5B. We used the network
weights that produced the best validation accuracy throughout training (i.e. the maxima in Fig.
4B). The models that were learned through different β values with conventional training had mostly
similar trade-off curves among them. To the contrary, in the case of RC-training, the trade-off curves
were different for different values of β. As a result, RC-training offers two methods for choosing the
desired trade-off. First, for a given trained model, the spiking threshold can be lowered for faster but
less accurate inference (Fig. 5A, each blue curve), as in the conventional non-RC-trained models.
However, the accuracy drop by lowering the threshold is signiﬁcant, in both the RC- and the non-RC-
trained cases. RC-training offers a second method, with a smaller accuracy drop for faster inference.
By varying β while keeping the threshold at a ﬁxed high value, signiﬁcantly earlier inference is
obtained for a much smaller drop or even slight increase in accuracy (Fig. 5A, red curve), as a result
of RC-training. Therefore, through RC-training, we have an additional option for tuning the speed
of inference, and the model recognizes the spoken keywords with higher accuracy than the non-RC-
trained model, at any desired speed setting. It should be noted that the threshold-tuning can be used
simultaneously with the β tuning method, as the two are orthogonal to each other and combinable."

RAPID KEYWORD CLASSIFICATION - GOOGLE SPEECH COMMANDS,0.40932642487046633,"Hence, more advanced threshold tuning mechanisms can be added after RC-training. For example,
it is possible to have a different threshold for each time-step through the input examples, and this set
of multiple thresholds at the inference stage can be optimized for a certain increase in accuracy (Tan
et al., 2021). Here instead we explored the direction of incorporating timing into the training process.
Future work could combine RC-training with the literature’s mechanisms that also optimize the RC-
inference stage. On θ during training, see Appendix C. In summary, RC-training was again effective
in optimizing the timing of inference, also in the time-critical application of keyword recognition
within speech recordings. It resulted in signiﬁcantly improved speed-accuracy trade-offs, and, in
combination with an entropy-based regularizer, it improved the tunability of those trade-offs."

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.46113989637305697,"All in all, we provided a theoretical motivation and a practical implementation for a spike-inspired
technique that adaptively decreases computation and increases speed during both training and infer-
ence, while only trading off a small cost of accuracy, and offering ﬂexibility in choosing the desired
speed-accuracy trade-off. On the one hand, our results strengthen the case for research in spike-
based networks, as they provide direct evidence for the beneﬁts of spikes. This is supported by our
comparisons of RC- to non-RC-training. On the other hand, our results suggest that conventional
ANNs too can beneﬁt by integrating speciﬁc isolated spike-inspired elements. For example, here
spikes were used only in the output, and only their triggering aspect was used, while the remaining
mechanisms were conventional RNNs and deep learning. This careful isolation of a speciﬁc neuro-
morphic feature allowed us to better understand and demonstrate several of RC’s advantages, despite
differences from Thorpe & Gautrais (1998). Other recent work also provided direct evidence for the
optimality of neuromorphic computing through focused application of very speciﬁc mechanisms
(Leng et al., 2018; Moraitis et al., 2020). In fact, the approach of identifying atomic neuromorphic
computational elements, isolating them from surrounding related complexities and embedding them
in otherwise conventional computational models, appears incremental but may be a more pragmatic
path towards fully neuromorphic computing. In addition to these broad implications, our results
also imply more focused impact, namely on SOTA benchmarks for SNNs, on SOTA algorithms for
fast inference, on the growing ﬁeld of adaptive computation with RNNs, and on speech recognition.
Therefore, further exploration of RC-RNNs may beneﬁt several different research directions."

element of the sequence provides additional evidence of the sequence class, the optimal choice to
maximise accuracy is to predict at the end of the sequence. Therefore this problem allows us to
compare RC training to traditional EOS training at trading off speed and accuracy."

a single hyperparameter β over which we completed a random search in the range [0.15, 2] with the

question is whether the early inference in this case is not due to the learned RC, but rather only
due to particularities in the speciﬁc dataset or properties of LSTM that SNN models don’t have.
To evaluate this, we trained an LSTM network (784-340-10) with RC and compared to non-RC-

the non-RC training objective is to maximize accuracy at the end of each input sequence, it is not
incentivised to provide reasonable outputs much earlier in the sequence, even though there is enough
exploitable information early. RC-training, on the other hand, is implicitly optimizing the timing of
its responses. This provides evidence that the strong performance in this task is largely a function of
the training mechanism rather than just a result of the dataset or of using an LSTM architecture."

(NON-)EFFECT OF THE THRESHOLD CHOICE θ DURING RC TRAINING"

In the training phase, the trade-off between resulting, i.e. inference, speed and accuracy is controlled
by varying β. We used a value of θ = 0.95 during training. Once the model is trained, thus far, we
have shown the possibility of also varying the threshold during inference as an additional mechanism
to further tweak this trade-off (Fig. 5)."

coding in non-spiking networks, and reaping beneﬁts from both worlds. We hope that our spike-
inspired method could feed back to the ﬁeld of SNNs in an adaptation of our scheme for fully spiking

commonly used example of a spiking neuron is the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) model. In discrete
time, the LIF can be seen as a recurrent ANN unit which can also be trained using an adaptation

RC-trained model provides much more accurate classiﬁcations in those early spikes (Figure 9 B).
We also consider varying the threshold on the ﬁnal trained model where we observe that the low
RC-accuracy of the non-RC-trained model can be improved by increasing the threshold value and
encouraging a slower inference speed, as expected. On the other hand, in contrast to the ANN mod-
