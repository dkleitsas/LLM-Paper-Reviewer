ABSTRACT,0.003067484662576687,"Learning generative object models from unlabelled videos is a long standing
problem and required for causal scene modeling. We decompose this problem into
three easier subtasks, and provide candidate solutions for each of them. Inspired
by the Common Fate Principle of Gestalt Psychology, we ﬁrst extract (noisy)
masks of moving objects via unsupervised motion segmentation. Second, gener-
ative models are trained on the masks of the background and the moving objects,
respectively. Third, background and foreground models are combined in a con-
ditional “dead leaves” scene model to sample novel scene conﬁgurations where
occlusions and depth layering arise naturally. To evaluate the individual stages, we
introduce the FISHBOWL dataset positioned between complex real-world scenes
and common object-centric benchmarks of simplistic objects. We show that our
approach allows learning generative models that generalize beyond the occlusions
present in the input videos, and represent scenes in a modular fashion that allows
sampling plausible scenes outside the training distribution by permitting, for
instance, object numbers or densities not observed in the training set."

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.009202453987730062,"Machine learning excels if sufﬁcient training data is available that is representative of the task at
hand. In recent years, this i.i.d. data paradigm has been shown not only to apply for pattern recog-
nition problems, but also for generative modeling (Goodfellow et al., 2014). In practice, the amount
of data required to reach a given level of performance will depend on the dimensionality of the
data. The generation of high-dimensional images thus either requires huge amounts of data (Karras
et al., 2020) or clever methods that exploit prior information, for instance on multi-scale structure or
compositionality (Razavi et al., 2019)."
INTRODUCTION,0.012269938650306749,"Imagine we would like to automatically generate realistic images of yearbook group photos. A
“brute force” approach would be to collect a massive dataset and train a large GAN (Goodfellow
et al., 2014), hoping that the model will not only learn typical backgrounds, but also the shape of
individual humans (or human faces), and arrange them into a group. A more modular approach, in
contrast, would be to learn object models (e.g., for faces, or humans), and learn in which positions
and arrangements they appear, as well as typical backgrounds. This approach would be more data-
efﬁcient: each training image would contain multiple humans, and we would thus effectively have
more data for the object learning task. In addition, the sub-task would be lower-dimensional than
the original task. Finally, if we leave the i.i.d. setting (by, say, having a second task with different
group sizes), the modular approach would lend itself more readily to knowledge transfer."
INTRODUCTION,0.015337423312883436,"Object-centric approaches aim to capture this compositionality and have been considerably im-
proved over the past few years (e.g., Locatello et al. 2020; Engelcke et al. 2021). However, these
models tend to be difﬁcult to train and do not yet scale well to visually more complex scenes. In addi-
tion, the commonly employed end-to-end learning approaches make it difﬁcult to dissect the causes
of these difﬁculties and what principles may be crucial to facilitate unsupervised object learning."

The idea to individually represent objects in a scene is not new.
One approach, motivated by the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm from cognitive science (Bever
& Poeppel, 2010), assumes a detailed speciﬁcation of the generative process and infers a scene
representation by trying to invert this process (Kulkarni et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2017; Jampani
et al., 2015). Many methods instead aim to also learn the generative process in an unsupervised
way, see Greff et al. (2020) for a recent survey.
Several models use a recurrent approach to
sequentially decompose a given scene into objects (Eslami et al., 2016; Stelzner et al., 2019;
Kosiorek et al., 2018; Gregor et al., 2015; Mnih et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2019; Engelcke et al.,
2020; Weis et al., 2020; von Kügelgen et al., 2020; Burgess et al., 2019), or directly learn a partial
ordering (Heess et al., 2011; Le Roux et al., 2011). This sequential approach has also been extended
with spatially-parallel components in (Dittadi & Winther, 2019; Jiang et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020b;
Chen et al., 2020). Other methods infer all object representations in parallel (Greff et al., 2017;
van Steenkiste et al., 2018), with subsequent iterative reﬁnement (Greff et al., 2019; Veerapaneni
et al., 2019; Locatello et al., 2020; Nanbo et al., 2020). Whereas most of the above models are
trained using a reconstruction objective—usually in a variational framework (Kingma & Welling,
2014; Rezende et al., 2014)—several works have also extended GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) to
generate scenes in a modular way (Yang et al., 2017; Turkoglu et al., 2019; Nguyen-Phuoc et al.,
2020; Ehrhardt et al., 2020; Niemeyer & Geiger, 2021). Those approaches typically use additional
supervision such as ground-truth segmentation or additional views, with Ehrhardt et al. (2020);
Niemeyer & Geiger (2021) being notable exceptions. While most methods can decompose a given
scene into its constituent objects, only few are fully-generative in the sense that they can generate
novel scenes (Lin et al., 2020a; Ehrhardt et al., 2020; Engelcke et al., 2020; von Kügelgen et al.,
2020; Engelcke et al., 2021; Niemeyer & Geiger, 2021; Dittadi & Winther, 2019)."

RELATED WORK,0.046012269938650305,"Figure 2: The FISHBOWL dataset: each video contains 128 frames with ground truth segmentation; renderings
and masks (without occlusion) of every ﬁsh and background are provided in the validation and test sets."
RELATED WORK,0.049079754601226995,"Our approach differs from previous works in the following three key aspects. First, previous ap-
proaches typically train a full scene model in an end-to-end fashion and include architectural biases
that lead to the models decomposing scenes into objects. While elegant in principle, those methods
have not be shown to scale to more realistic datasets yet. Using a multi-stage approach, as in the
present work, enables re-use of existing computer vision methods (such as unsupervised motion seg-
mentation) for well-studied sub-tasks and therefore scales more easily to visually complex scenes.
Second, while some existing methods make use of temporal information from videos (Lin et al.,
2020a; Crawford & Pineau, 2020; Kosiorek et al., 2018; Weis et al., 2020), they do not explicitely
use motion signals to discover (i.e., segment) objects. Inspired by the development of the human
visual system (Spelke, 1990), we instead explicitly include this segmentation cue in our approach.
Third, most existing fully-generative approaches use a spatial mixture model to compose objects
into a scene (Ehrhardt et al., 2020; Engelcke et al., 2020; 2021). While this simpliﬁes training, it
clearly does not match the true, underlying scene generation process. In this work, we instead follow
the dead leaves model-approach of von Kügelgen et al. (2020) and scale it to more complex scenes."
RELATED WORK,0.05214723926380368,"Motion Segmentation. We require an unsupervised motion segmentation method that is able to
segment multiple object instances. For this, we build on a line of work that tracks points with
optical ﬂow, and then performs clustering in the space of the resulting point trajectories (Brox &
Malik, 2010; Ochs et al., 2014; Ochs & Brox, 2012; Keuper et al., 2015). Motion segmentation
methods that require supervision (Dave et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019; Tokmakov et al., 2017a;b)
or only perform binary motion segmentation (Yang et al., 2021; 2019; Ranjan et al., 2019) are not
applicable in our unsupervised setting."
RELATED WORK,0.05521472392638037,"Learning from motion. In the present work, we propose exploiting motion information to decom-
pose a scene into objects, and to learn generative object and scene models. Motion information is
believed to be an important cue for the development of the human visual system (Spelke, 1990) and
has also been used as a training signal for computer vision (Pathak et al., 2017; Dorfman et al., 2013;
Mahendran et al., 2018a;b). While similar in spirit, these works however do not address learning of
generative object and scene models."

and appearances provided by those datasets, however, only cover the visible parts of the scene. In
order to evaluate the capabilities of the object model to infer and represent the full objects even
in the presence of occlusions, we propose the novel FISHBOWL dataset positioned between com-

A MULTI-STAGE APPROACH FOR UNSUPERVISED SCENE MODELLING,0.07975460122699386,"As a ﬁrst step, we use unsupervised motion segmentation to obtain candidate segmentations of
the input videos. We build on the minimum cost multicut method by Keuper et al. (2015), which
tracks a subset of the pixels through the video using optical ﬂow and then, inspired by the Common
Fate Principle mentioned earlier, clusters the trajectories based on pairwise motion afﬁnities. We
use the original implementation of the authors, but replace the postprocessing required to obtain
a dense segmentation with a simpler but faster non-parametric watershed algorithm (Beucher &
Meyer, 1993) followed by computing spatiotemporal connected components (Silversmith, 2021)."
A MULTI-STAGE APPROACH FOR UNSUPERVISED SCENE MODELLING,0.08282208588957055,"The quality of the motion segmentation critically depends on the quality on the optical ﬂow estima-
tion, so we explore different models for that step. ARFlow (Liu et al., 2020) is the current state of
the art self-supervised optical ﬂow method that combines a common warping based objective with
self-supervision using various augmentations. We use the published pretrained models as well as a
variant trained on the Fishbowl dataset (see supplement for details). Similar augmentations as used
by ARFlow can alternatively be used to synthesize training data for supervised methods, as done
for generating the FlyingChairs and FlyingThings datasets (Dosovitskiy et al., 2015; Mayer et al.,
2016). We experiment with FlowNet 2.0 (Ilg et al., 2017) and the more recent RAFT (Teed & Deng,
2020) trained on those two datasets."

between multiple object instances. We aim for a low rate of foreground pixels being mistaken for
background pixels, while background pixels mistaken for foreground are of less concern. Hence, we
use an ensemble of different background-foreground segmentation models from the bgslibrary (So-
bral, 2013). Based on early experiments, we used the PAWKS (St-Charles et al., 2016), LOBSTER
(St-Charles & Bilodeau, 2014), Σ −∆estimation (Manzanera & Richefeu, 2007) and static frame
differences and label every pixel detected as foreground by either of the methods as a foreground
pixel. We found that this rather simple model can faithfully remove the foreground objects in most
of the cases. We provide additional details in the appendix."

bounding boxes with a minimum distance of 16px to the frame boundary. Accordingly, we extract
the candidate segmentation masks m0,...,mK for each crop. For notational convenience, we take m0

entropy threshold can be used to trade diversity of samples for higher-quality samples (cf. supple-
ment). For the coordinates, a uniform prior within the image yields reasonable samples, and scales
can be sampled from a uniform distribution between 64 × 32px and 192 × 96px and at ﬁxed 2 : 1

for the ARFlow model. Different from the other networks, this model does not easily transfer from
unrelated training settings and doesn’t improve much when training on the Fishbowl data directly
using the default hyperparameters. It might however be possible to improve the model by adapting
the training setup to our dataset more closely."
EXPERIMENTS,0.18404907975460122,"Overall, the evaluation reveals two types of errors: (1) even the best model variant only detected
67.4% of all objects, i.e., one third of the objects are missed and get included in the background
masks. (2) The recall decreases when increasing the IoU threshold to 0.5, i.e., the predicted masks
are often not precise. While the motion segmentation therefore induces a sort of label noise, it has
to be considered that not all errors are problematic for the motion segmentation. In particular, this
holds for all objects that have not been detected at all and unsystematic errors."
EXPERIMENTS,0.18711656441717792,"Object model. To evaluate the capability of the object model to reconstruct unoccluded objects
from occluded inputs, we extract object crops from the validation set using the bounding boxes
of the ground truth unoccluded masks. For those crops, we compare the masks and appearances
reconstructed by the model to the unoccluded ground truth (Fig. 2) using IoU and mean average error
(MAE), respectively. As we are only interested in the reconstruction error within the object masks,
we evaluate the MAE only on the intersection of the predicted and ground truth mask. We consider
the ground truth unoccluded segmentation masks as our baseline: they correspond to a model that
perfectly segments all visible object parts, but does not complete partial objects. We train variants of
the object model using all augmentation strategies described above. For comparison, we also train
each model variant using the ground truth occluded segmentation masks so that errors propagated
from the motion segmentation can be differentiated from errors inherent to the object model."
EXPERIMENTS,0.1901840490797546,"As the results in Tab. 2 show, using another object from the input batch as artiﬁcial occlusions results
in the best IoU of 0.827. When considering only those objects that are occluded at least by 50%, the
IoU drops to 0.705. This performance is substantially greater than the baseline (0.27), which indi-
cates that the model learns to complete partial objects even for those hard cases. In terms of the ap-
pearance error, using the cutout augmentation performs best. Interestingly though, for both the mask
and appearance error, training without any augmentation at all reduces the performance only slightly."
EXPERIMENTS,0.19325153374233128,"When training on the ground truth segmentation instead of the motion segmentation, the error in
terms of the IoU reduces by roughly one third. Performance gains can therefore be expected from
improving the generative object model and, to a lesser extent, the motion segmentation. Overall, the
object model seems to be quite robust to the label noise induced by the motion segmentation."

In particular this holds for the hard cases with substantial occlusions. Moreover, the samples from

DISCUSSION"
DISCUSSION,0.2607361963190184,"The ﬁelds of machine learning and causal modeling have recently begun to cross-pollinate. Causal-
ity offers a principled framework to think about classes of distributions related to each other by
domain shifts and interventions, and independent/modular components (e.g., objects) that are in-
variant across such changes. Vice versa, machine learning has something to offer to causality when
it comes to learning causal variables and representations—traditionally, research in causal discovery
and inference built on the assumption that those variables be given a priori. Much like the shift
from classic AI towards machine learning included a shift from processing human-deﬁned symbols
towards automatically learning features and statistical representations, causal representation learn-
ing aims to learn interventional representations from raw data (Schölkopf et al., 2021). It is in this"

objects and their positions/sizes are presented as individual entities."
DISCUSSION,0.26993865030674846,"sense that we like to think of our scene model as a causal generative model, even though it is fairly
straightforward from the causal point of view."
DISCUSSION,0.27300613496932513,"We propose a multi-stage approach for learning generative object models from unlabelled videos.
Inspired by the Gestalt Principle of Common Fate, we use candidate segmentations obtained from
unsupervised optic ﬂow to weakly supervise generative object and background models, and combine
them into a scene model. The scene model is causal/mechanistic in the sense that it (1) learns
complete objects (although occlusions are abundant in the training data)2 and (2) properly handles
partial depth orderings in the scene, the latter through the dead leaves approach—as opposed to
the computationally simpler additive mixture approach which is common place in end-to-end scene
models, but contradicts the physics of scene generation. Moreover, while many existing models only
decompose and represent scenes, (3) our model can generate plausible novel and out-of-distribution
scenes (e.g., higher ﬁsh density, different sizes). This showcases the challenges faced by end-to-end
learning when not endowed with sufﬁcient prior structure and inductive biases."
DISCUSSION,0.27607361963190186,"While learning object models as part of an end-to-end trainable object centric scene model might be
more elegant in principle, it has not been shown to scale to more realistic data yet. We instead chose
a multi-stage approach that allows developing and analyzing the modeling stages individually. This
approach allowed us to conclude that exploiting motion information for object discovery, as done
in the motion segmentation stage, is a valuable cue that greatly simpliﬁes object learning. Also,
since the scene model uses the component models as modelling “atoms”, this naturally permits
intervening on the parameters deﬁning the scene composition without side-effects, as stipulated by
the principle of Independent Causal Mechanisms (Parascandolo et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2017)."
DISCUSSION,0.2791411042944785,"We evaluated the modelling stages on the novel FISHBOWL dataset, consisting of short videos
recorded from a synthetic 3D aquarium. Notably, we found that the generative object model proves
to be fairly robust to errors in the motion segmentation. We expect further performance gains to be
achievable by improving the visual ﬁdelity of the generative object and background models (Razavi
et al., 2019; Vahdat & Kautz, 2020); however, this was not the motivation for the present work."
DISCUSSION,0.2822085889570552,"We see several ways to extend our model in the future, beyond improving the implementations of the
individual stages by taking advantage of progress in computer vision. One limitation of using mo-
tion segmentation is that we can only decompose scenes of moving objects. This could be addressed
by integrating object models trained using our approach into an end-to-end scene model, e.g., the
work of Eslami et al. (2016) and its successors. When using a learning based motion segmenta-
tion approach, there could be a feedback circle with both models improving each other as training
progresses and this way closing the observed gap to using ground truth segmentations. Finally, our
object model does currently not capture object motions. Given that the motion segmentation yields
temporally consistent segmentation masks, this could, in principle, well be included in our approach."

ETHICS STATEMENT,0.29141104294478526,"Ethics statement.
While there is some way to go when it comes to the generation of photorealistic
scenes, we note that being able to automatically generate coherent scenes, including the interven-
tional control that our approach pioneers, could be misused to synthesize or modify scenes, rein-
forcing the need to develop methods that allow to reliably detect manipulated content. On the other
hand, the interpretability that comes with the modularity of our method can yield insights into scene
perception, and could therefore facilitate better explanations for model decisions."
REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT,0.294478527607362,"Reproducibility statement.
We took several steps to make our work reproducible: For the dataset
generation, we modiﬁed the Aquarium simulation on which our dataset is based, in order to make
the rendering fully deterministic. The conﬁguration ﬁles describing the recording settings for all
samples will be published with the generation code along the dataset, which allows re-recording
all videos. Moreover, the code for training our models is deterministic and will be made publicly
available."

stead only reconstruct a non-occluded background sample.
We sweep over learning rates in
{1·10−3,5·10−4,1·10−4} and β in {10−2,10−3,10−4,10−3} and select the model with β = 10−3"

caused the training to collapse (low prior loss, but high reconstruction loss). As noted in the main
text, the background model performance (and resolution) can be very likely improved by using larger
models, more hyperparameter tuning and better decoders suited to the high resolution. As noted in
the main paper, we omit these optimizations within the scope of this work and rather focus on the
object and scene models."

model. We omit reconstructing the mask. In the input image for the background model, all fore-

• All samples are recorded for 128 frames at 30Hz. We modiﬁed the aquarium to only advance to
the next frame once the current frame is captured and sent to the server.
• For recording the masks, we modiﬁed the texture shaders to use a unique color for rendering every
object. Furthermore, we disabled all rendering steps modifying those colors (anti-aliasing, alpha
compositing).
• To make the recording fully deterministic, we disabled the bubbles in the aquarium.
• To increase the diversity of the ﬁsh in the aquarium, we applied random color shifts to all ﬁsh
textures except sharks, for which those color shifts look very unnatural. We shifted each color by
rotating each color value in the IQ plane of the YIQ color space. For each ﬁsh, we independently
and uniformly sampled one of 8 discrete color shifts regularly spaced in [0°,360°].
• During post-processing, we used ffmpeg4 to rescale and centrally crop 480 × 320px from every
frame and encode all frames as a video. We cropped and rescaled the masks same way, but
exported them as json using the run length encoding provided by the COCO API5.
• For recording the unoccluded ground truth, we used above setup to record and post-process frames
and masks of the validation and test samples, but only render the respective ﬁsh of interest."

COMPARISON TO RELATED METHODS"
LATENTS,0.8558282208588958,"D.1
GAN BASELINE"
LATENTS,0.8588957055214724,"As a baseline method for generating novel scenes for the FISHBOWL dataset, we consider the GAN
used by Mescheder et al. (2018) for the CelebA-HQ dataset (Karras et al., 2018). We used the ofﬁcial
implementation available at https://github.com/LMescheder/GAN_stability, and only changed the
resolution of the generated images to 192 × 128px. For training, we used every 16th frame from
each input video in the training set rescaled to the resolution of the GAN, resulting in 160k training
images. We trained the model for 90 epochs."
LATENTS,0.8619631901840491,"Fig. 17 shows samples from the model in comparison to training frames. Overall, the GAN is able to
generate images of convincing quality resembling the training images well. A particular strength of
the GAN in comparison to our method, is it’s ability to generate backgrounds with many details—
which we explicitly left for future work. Several ﬁsh generated by the GAN however look distorted,
in agreement with previous works concluding that GANs are good at generating “stuff”, but have
difﬁculties generating objects Bau et al. (2019). This becomes especially apparent when visualizing
interpolations in the latent space between samples, as done in Fig. 18."
LATENTS,0.8650306748466258,"Many differences between the samples generated by the GAN and our method, respectively, stem
from the GAN being able to learn the overall statistics of the scenes well, but not learning a notion
of objects. Compared to the GAN baseline, our object-centric approach offers several conceptual
advantages: (1) The background and the objects in each scene are represented individually by our
method, which makes it straightforward to intervene on the generated samples in a meaningful way
(Fig. 6). While directions in the latent space of the GAN that correspond to semantically meaningful
changes in the image might well exist, the GAN framework does not offer a principled way to
ﬁnd those directions without supervision. (2) While the GAN is able to generate novel scenes, it
cannot be used to infer the composition of input scenes. (3) An optimally trained GAN perfectly
captures the statistics of the input scene—making it impossible to generate samples beyond the
training distribution. As our model explicitly represents scene parameters such as the number and
position of ﬁsh, our model can be used for controlled out-of-distribution sampling (Fig. 6)."

SPACE (LIN ET AL., 2020B)"
LATENTS,0.8803680981595092,"SPACE (Lin et al., 2020b) is an object-centric representation learning method following the Attend-
Infer-Repeat (AIR) framework (Eslami et al., 2016; Crawford & Pineau, 2019). Different from the
AIR model, the detection of objects and inference of their latent representation is fully parallelized
to make the approach faster and more scalable. We trained SPACE on the Fishbowl dataset us-
ing the implementation provided by the authors (https://github.com/zhixuan-lin/SPACE). We used
the default hyperparameters and trained two variants using a 4x4 and 8x8 grid of object detectors,
respectively. As for the GAN baseline in appendix D, we used every 16th frame for training this
model to keep the training time reasonable (160k frames in total). Despite the subsampling, this
is still substantially more data than the model was trained on in the original paper (60k images).
SPACE expects the input images to have equal width and height, therefore we used a central square
crop from every frame."
LATENTS,0.8834355828220859,"Training the model on a single Nvidia RTX 2080ti GPU is relatively fast (14h for the 4x4 grid and
18h for the 8x8 grid), conﬁrming the performance advantage of the parallel object detectors. As
the results in the Fig. 19 show, the object reconstructions from the model overall look reasonable.
Most structure in the background is missed by the model, however we conjecture that this might
be solvable by adapting the capacity of the background network. The visualization of the object
detections however reveals a more fundamental failure mode due to the grid structure used by the
object detector in SPACE: Larger ﬁsh are split across several cells, even when using only 4x4 cells.
As each cell can only handle at most one object, decreasing the cell count further is not expected to
yield sensible results, as this limits the number of objects too much. Lin et al. (2020b) mentioned
this problem and introduced a boundary loss to address it, however on the Fishbowl dataset this does
not resolve the problem. We hypothesize that an approach based on a ﬁxed grid, while adequate in
some cases and having substantial performance advantages, doesn’t work well with objects showing
large scale variations as present in our newly proposed dataset. We believe this is a limitation of
SPACE that cannot be resolved with further model tuning."

trained a variant of our object model that uses the glimpse encoder and decoder from SPACE. We
increased the learning rate to 0.0005 following an initial grid search, but otherwise left all hyperpa-
rameters unchanged. As the second step, we included the pretrained glimpse encoder and decoder
into the SPACE model and trained the full model end-to-end as described above (using a grid size
of 4x4). When we continued to train the glimpse encoder and decoder in the end-to-end setting,
we noticed similar failures as described above. Therefore we froze the respective weights after the
pretraining step."
LATENTS,0.8957055214723927,"Figure 20 shows results from this model variant. Early during the training, the model is in many
cases able to detect the objects in the input scenes. This especially holds for larger objects that
have been shown to be problematic for the end-to-end model before. Later during training SPACE
however increasingly uses the background model to also explain foreground objects. In addition,
we evaluated both the pretrained and end-to-end trained object model from SPACE using the ground
truth unoccluded objects. As the quantitative results in Table Tab. 4 show, the reconstruction of
the appearance works better with the SPACE object model than with our architecture6, but has a
substantial gap in the segmentation performance. More importantly, the results clearly show an
improvement of the motion segmentation based training over the original end-to-end approach, con-
ﬁrming the qualitative results."

scenes however fails with this model conﬁguration. Most likely this happens due to the GECO ob-
jective (Rezende & Viola, 2018), that decreases the weight of the KL term in the loss function as
long as the log likelihood of the input sample is below the target value. Training GENESIS-v2 with
the original VAE objective instead of GECO leads to better scene samples, the decomposition of the

LATENTS,0.941717791411043,"The results in Tab. 5 and Fig. 23 show that the model generally performs well, but worse than our

(10 vs 5 layers, 128 vs 64 latent dimensions) which seems to be necessary to model the visually
more complex objects in our setting. Also when trained separately, the object model has difﬁculties
with sampling novel ﬁsh, which can be addressed at the cost of worse reconstructions 24."
LATENTS,0.9447852760736196,"Overall we conclude that our modular object learning approach scales much better to visually more
complex scenes than end-to-end training as done by GENESIS-v2. Even when using the GENESIS-
v2 component decoder within our framework, the necessary trade-off between reconstruction and
generation capabilities seems to be more favorable when using our modular approach as opposed
to the end-to-end training. We remark that this comparison comes with a grain of salt: We neither
adapted the hyperparameters of GENESIS-v2 nor of our method and the same decoder is used within
GENESIS-v2 for the background, too. The strong qualitative difference in sample quality however
makes it unlikely that this explains all of the difference. Moreover, our approach only addresses
learning generative object models whereas GENESIS-v2 is also capable to infer the decomposition
of static input scenes. For the future, we therefore see much potential in combining the respective
strengths of both methods."

Fishbowl dataset. Due to the smaller dataset size, we trained the model for 600 epochs and reduced
the learning rate only after 400 epochs. As the videos in the dataset were all recorded from the
same stationary trafﬁc camera, we did not train a background model but used the mean-ﬁltered
background directly. In contrast to the aquarium dataset, the object positions and sizes are not
