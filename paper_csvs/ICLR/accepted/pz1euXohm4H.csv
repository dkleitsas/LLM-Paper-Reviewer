ABSTRACT,0.003401360544217687,"Autoregressive sequence generation, a prevalent task in machine learning and
natural language processing, generates every target token conditioned on both
a source input and previously generated target tokens. Previous data augmen-
tation methods, which have been shown to be effective for the task, mainly en-
hance source inputs (e.g., injecting noise into the source sequence by random
swapping or masking, back translation, etc.) while overlooking the target-side
augmentation. In this work, we propose a target-side augmentation method for
sequence generation. In training, we use the decoder output probability distri-
butions as soft indicators, which are multiplied with target token embeddings, to
build pseudo tokens. These soft pseudo tokens are then used as target tokens to en-
hance the training. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various sequence
generation tasks, including dialog generation, machine translation, and abstractive
summarization. Without using any extra labeled data or introducing additional
model parameters, our method signiﬁcantly outperforms strong baselines. The

INTRODUCTION"
INTRODUCTION,0.01020408163265306,"Sequence generation is an important class of machine learning tasks and has made great progress
in recent years (Vaswani et al., 2017; Hassan et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2020; Stiennon et al., 2020).
In general, it is to generate sequences of interest based on a given source input. For example, in
text summarization, the source input is a long document while the target sequence is a summary.
In machine translation, the source input is a sentence in a language while the target output is a
sentence in another language. Autoregressive (AR) methods, which generate tokens one by one au-
toregressively to leverage previously generated tokens, are widely used in most sequence generation
problems (Gatt & Krahmer, 2018; Brown et al., 2020)."
INTRODUCTION,0.013605442176870748,"Data augmentation is a crucial technology for many machine learning tasks including sequence
generation. The goal of data augmentation is to increase the number of training examples without
incurring additional efforts of manually labeling, which could be costly or even impossible. For
example, Wang et al. (2018) add random noise into input sequences, Gao et al. (2019) use a pre-
trained language model to synthesize pseudo input sequences, and Edunov et al. (2018) use back-
translation to synthesize pseudo-pairs for machine translation. Furthermore, we list more works
about the data augmentation method in Section 2."
INTRODUCTION,0.017006802721088437,"While these works have demonstrated promising improvements, an inherent aspect of AR sequence
generation is generally overlooked. As illustrated in Figure 1, in AR generation, each token is gen-
erated based on two kinds of input information: the original source inputs and previously generated
target-side tokens (aka target-side inputs). While most existing data augmentation works focus on
enhancing source inputs, the augmentation of target-side inputs is under-explored. As far as we"

related to this problem, which are to address the exposure bias issue (Bengio et al., 2015) of the
teacher forcing training. Those works adjust the sequence in token-level by randomly sampling
target-side words from ground truth and model output. However, the token level adjustment may
not fully leverage the potential of target input."

INTRODUCTION,0.05442176870748299,"This work focuses on target-side data aug-
mentation for sequence generation and pro-
poses a sequence-level target-side augmenta-
tion method.
In training, we ﬁrst feed the
ground truth target tokens to the decoder to gen-
erate the output probability distributions (over
the target vocabulary) for each target position.
Then these distributions are multiplied with
the target-side token embeddings to build soft
pseudo tokens as enhanced target-side inputs.
Inspired by the success of mixup (Hongyi et al.,
2018), the pseudo tokens are further mixed
up with original ground truth target tokens to
build synthetic target-side sequences. Next, our
model is trained with both ground truth data and
synthetic data. Note that we only change the target tokens for decoder input rather than target outputs
or labels. Our model can beneﬁt from the stochastic representation of target input tokens to achieve
better performance. The inference process is kept the same as the conventional method. Moreover,
no extra data or model parameters are required during inference. That is, we do not introduce any
additional burden on model inference."

RELATED WORK"
RELATED WORK,0.0782312925170068,"Data augmentation has been widely used in almost all tasks of deep learning and has been widely
surveyed before (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Wen et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2021). In this section,
we only brieﬂy discuss works related to our method."
RELATED WORK,0.08163265306122448,"Rule-based augmentation:
Some works propose to use heuristic rules to augment the source
data. For example, Wang et al. (2018) randomly replace words in sentences with another word in
the vocabulary, Guo et al. (2020) softly combine sequences in the training set, Shen et al. (2020)
randomly erase part of a sequence to build restricted views, and Sennrich et al. (2016b) use pervasive
dropout to enrich data. However, those methods target to enhance source input and do not pay
attention to the target input."
RELATED WORK,0.08503401360544217,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
RELATED WORK,0.08843537414965986,"Model-based augmentation:
In this category of methods, deep learning models are used to gen-
erate the augmented data. For example, Gao et al. (2019) leverage a language model to enhance
the source tokens, and Kumar et al. (2020) use BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), GPT-2 (Radford et al.,
2019), and BART (Lewis et al., 2020) to generate pseudo data. For tasks with high duality, e.g.,
machine translation, back translation is widely used (Sennrich et al., 2016a; Edunov et al., 2018;
Prabhumoye et al., 2018; Hoang et al., 2018). Usually, large-scale monolingual data is used to build
pseudo training data. Similar to rule-based methods, the model-based methods do not pay much
effort to the target input either."
RELATED WORK,0.09183673469387756,"Knowledge distillation:
Knowledge distillation is also a widely used method for sequence gen-
eration (Hinton et al., 2015; Kim & Rush, 2016; He et al., 2019; Gou et al., 2021). In this method,
teacher models are trained to generate synthetic labels for student models. However, for student
models, the target input and output of the decoder are still same. On the contrary, our methods focus
on changing the target input, therefore the decoder input and output are different. And we do not
have any intention of model compression."
RELATED WORK,0.09523809523809523,"Scheduled sampling:
Scheduled sampling methods are invented to solve the exposure-bias prob-
lem (Bengio et al., 2015; Mihaylova & Martins, 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). Although these methods
also change the target input, they can only work in the token-level adaptation. In contrast, our
method builds sequence-level synthetic data to improve training performance. This is an important
difference between our method and scheduled sampling methods. Besides, when using sentence-
level oracle, OR-NMT (Zhang et al., 2019) need full decoding and training time could be 5x slower."
RELATED WORK,0.09863945578231292,"Reinforcement learning:
The reﬁnement learning (RL) based sequence generation meth-
ods (Ranzato et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2016; Norouzi et al., 2016) can directly optimize the metrics
that are used in test time and the target input of decoder is not always necessary. However, success-
fully training a RL-based sequence generation is still challenging due to its instability (Wu et al.,
2018). Therefore, we focus on AR generation in this paper."
RELATED WORK,0.10204081632653061,"Non-autoregressive generation:
Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation has been proposed as an
alternative sequence generation paradigm, where all target tokens are generated in parallel. Although
model performance has been greatly improved by many recent works (Gu et al., 2018; Qian et al.,
2021; Ren et al., 2020), the AR generation is still the most common approach. Therefore, we choose
to study the AR generation in this work and leave the application on NAR for future work."
RELATED WORK,0.1054421768707483,"Iterative reﬁnement:
Iterative reﬁnement is a common way to improve performance. For exam-
ple, Xia et al. (2017) proposed deliberation networks, and Lee et al. (2018) proposed to use iterative
reﬁnement in the NAR generation (Gu et al., 2018). However, these methods need multiple passes
during inference time. Therefore, the iterative NAR is slower than fully NAR method (Gu & Kong,
2021). By contrast, our method only augments the data during training and has no extra inference
cost. This makes our methods applicable to more scenarios where latency is critical."

on x or y. This augmentation method can be rule based (e.g., a noise function) or model based (e.g.,
a pre-trained language model). It may also contain some external knowledge or heuristic (Wang

methods’. We can witness the similar improvement in Table 2, especially on the R-L (+0.93) and
the CIDEr (+0.73) metric. Furthermore, following Liu et al. (2020b), we conducted the human eval-
uation on Persona-Chat data set, and the average score is improved from 1.18 to 1.49, which veriﬁed
the quality improvement of our method. More details about human evaluation is in Appendix."

MACHINE TRANSLATION,0.3741496598639456,"On machine translation task, we conduct experiments on two widely used data sets: the IWSLT’14
English (EN) ↔German (DE) data set (Cettolo et al., 2014), which is a small scale data set with
140k sentence pairs, and the WMT’14 EN →DE dataset (Bojar et al., 2014), which is a larger one
with 4.5M sentence pairs. We use the scripts from Ott et al. (2019) to process data. For IWSLT’14
EN↔DE, all words are lowercased and tokenized, and for WMT’14, all sentences are kept as orig-
inal case then tokenized. Then the tokenized sentences are processed by BPE (Sennrich et al.,
2016d) with 10k and 40k steps, respectively. We use transformer small for IWSLT’14 and
transformer base for WMT’14, where the details are described in Section 4.1. The subscript
1 or 2 of our method means the number of rounds used in augmentation. Our results are generated
by beam search using beam size 5. We compute the BLEU score by the Moses script (Koehn et al.,
2007) with the same tokenizer used by previous works."

standard AR training without data augmentation, other Transformer variants, and previous works
about data augmentation. Compared with Transformer without data augmentation, our method
achieves 1.65-point BLEU gain on IWSLT’14 EN→DE direction, 2.36-point on DE→EN direction,"

our results are better than other methods with complex architecture modiﬁcation (the ﬁrst group in

the importance of target-side data augmentation and the potency of our algorithm."
MACHINE TRANSLATION,0.3877551020408163,"Moreover, we added an extra round of data augmentation on the IWSLT’14 data set, and the results
are in the last row of Table 3. We can see that the BLEU scores can be further boosted while
the improvement is smaller than the ﬁrst round’s. This phenomenon is consistent with other data
augmentation methods, e.g., iterative back-translation (Hoang et al., 2018)."
MACHINE TRANSLATION,0.391156462585034,"Finally, we combine our method with previous data augmentation method, i.e., back translation.
More speciﬁcally, without using extra monolingual data, we translate the target sentences in the
training set using a backward translation model. When jointly using BT and our method, the BLEU
score can be boosted to 37.17, which is higher than using any of the methods solely. The result
exempliﬁes that our method is complementary to other data augmentation methods."

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK"
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.54421768707483,"This paper studies a fundamental yet widely overlooked problem: augmenting the target input infor-
mation for autoregressive sequence generation tasks. While data augmentation methods have been
approved to be critical for machine learning, the study of enhancing the target-side conditional input
is still limited. Meanwhile, we propose a sequence-level data augmentation method by using soft
labels from the decoder output. Then the mixup method is used to generate synthetic data for model
training. We conducted comprehensive experiments on three sequence generation tasks of ﬁve data
sets. The experimental results suggest that augmenting target input beneﬁts the sequence generation
quality. Moreover, our method can vastly boost the model performance for these tasks. We hope
this can bring more attention to this type of augmentation method."
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK,0.5476190476190477,"There are many potential directions for future research. First, the investigation into other meth-
ods to augment this information will be fascinating. Second, applying such an idea to large-scale
pre-training could also be substantial. Last, how to combine this method with other mono data aug-
mentation methods, e.g., a VAE model, is also a signiﬁcant challenge. Therefore, we expect more
research to be done in this area in the future."

with the training progress, while the initial model quality may not be good, which will affect the
synthetic data quality. Thus, we believed it could be better to have a warm-up stage when the model
only learns from real data. Empirically, we ﬁnd that the performance of the model with almost all
hyper-parameters do not increase any more after the 50th epoch. That’s the reason that we choose
55 in S2. However, compared with a ﬁxed value, we did not observe improvement. Therefore, we
kept a ﬁxed value in all other experiments."
